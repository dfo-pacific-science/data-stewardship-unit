For relationship fixes, state the current relationship and the change you want. GitHub is preferred; if needed, email the <a href=\"mailto:FADSDataStewardship-GestiondesdonneesSFDA@dfo-mpo.gc.ca\">FADS Data Stewardship Unit</a> (note: response time may be longer). See our <a href=\"https://github.com/dfo-pacific-science/dfo-salmon-ontology/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\" target=\"_blank\">Contributing Guidelines</a> for more details.\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Browse All Terms\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n## About the Vocabulary Structure\n\nUnder the hood, the vocabulary is formatted in SKOS (Simple Knowledge Organization System), a W3C-recommended framework for representing controlled vocabularies and thesauri. By modeling terms and their relationships (broader, narrower, related), SKOS makes it easy to:\n\n- Maintain consistent labels, definitions, and concept hierarchies.\n- Share and integrate the vocabulary with other systems that understand RDF.\n\nThe vocabulary is intended to be a living document that evolves with the needs of the community. It is maintained by the Data Stewardship Unit (DSU) within the Fisheries and Assessment Data Section (FADS) in the Pacific Region of Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO).\n\nThe vocabulary is more than a simple glossary: it is a formally structured controlled vocabulary that uses the W3C-endorsed Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS), enabling machine-readable formats for integration into data systems, APIs, and web applications. For a deep-dive on the how and why of controlled vocabularies, see our guide: [Support Controlled Vocabularies](https://dfo-pacific-science.github.io/data-stewardship-unit/tutorials/support_controlled_vocabs.html).\n\n## Contributing\n\nFile a GitHub Issue at https://github.com/dfo-pacific-science/data-stewardship-unit/issues\n\nOr contact the Data Stewardship Unit.\n",
