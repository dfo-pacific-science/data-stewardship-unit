    "text": "This guide introduces the Darwin Core (DwC) standard and its role in supporting data interoperability and publication for Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO). It also provides an overview of the Unified GBIF Data Model and the Ocean Biodiversity Information System (OBIS). The focus is on how commonly used fields in DFO fisheries datasets map to Darwin Core terms, enabling integration across internal and external systems.\n\n\n\nDarwin Core is a biodiversity data standard maintained by Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG). It provides a stable, referenceable set of terms designed to facilitate sharing information about biological diversity ‚Äî particularly the occurrence of taxa in nature, along with associated metadata like location, time, method, and taxonomy.\nDarwin Core is intentionally broad, supporting data from natural history collections, ecological surveys, tagging programs, and more.\n\n\n\n\nIn the DFO Pacific Region, diverse data formats and schemas are used across programs, divisions, and systems. Darwin Core provides a common data standard that enables these internal formats to be mapped to:\n\nOther DFO systems\nNational open data platforms\nInternational biodiversity repositories (e.g., GBIF, OBIS)\n\nBy treating Darwin Core as a semantic translation layer, we can harmonize our internal datasets for interoperability, discoverability, and reuse, without requiring all groups to adopt the same database design.\n\n\n\n\nThe GBIF Unified Data Model extends Darwin Core to support complex biodiversity datasets, including:\n\nEvents (e.g., sampling campaigns, cruises, transects)\nOccurrences (e.g., individual specimens, observations)\nMeasurements or Facts (e.g., biological measurements, environmental conditions)\n\nThis model aligns with DFO data practices that involve nested relationships between surveys, gear deployments, catches, and individual biological samples.\n\n\n\n\nOBIS builds on Darwin Core and the GBIF model to support marine biodiversity data. It uses a Darwin Core Archive format with specific extensions for:\n\nSampling Effort\nEnvironmental Parameters\nTaxonomic Verification\n\nOBIS is the global node for marine biodiversity under the UN Ocean Decade and is highly relevant for DFO‚Äôs coastal and offshore research.\n\n\n\n\nBelow are examples of how commonly used columns in DFO data systems align with Darwin Core terms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDFO Field / Concept\nDarwin Core Term\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nSpecies_Code or Species_Name\nscientificName\nCan be resolved via WoRMS or NCBI\n\n\nSample_ID\noccurrenceID\nA globally unique identifier for the specimen or observation\n\n\nCatch_Date\neventDate\nIdeally formatted as ISO 8601\n\n\nSurvey_Name\neventID\nUse hierarchical eventIDs for nested events (e.g., cruise ‚Üí tow ‚Üí sample)\n\n\nLatitude, Longitude\ndecimalLatitude, decimalLongitude\nUse WGS84 datum\n\n\nDepth_m\nminimumDepthInMeters, maximumDepthInMeters\nUse both where applicable\n\n\nSex, Maturity, Length, Weight\nmeasurementType, measurementValue, measurementUnit\nRecorded under the MeasurementOrFact extension\n\n\nGear_Type\nsamplingProtocol\nUse consistent terminology for methods\n\n\nArea_Code, Subarea\nlocationID, locality\nAlign to spatial standards like NAFO/DFO zones\n\n\nData_Source, Project_Name\ndatasetName, recordedBy\nIdentify project or responsible team\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDFO‚Äôs long-term goal is to develop controlled vocabularies and ontology modules that align with:\n\nDarwin Core term values\nThe NERC Vocabulary Server (NVS) for environmental parameters\nWorld Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) for taxonomic resolution\nCF Conventions for oceanographic and climate data\nThe Salmon Ontology developed by NCEAS\n\nThese efforts will allow for semantic alignment, improving both machine-readability and clarity for analysts and stakeholders.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are actively building a DFO metadata crosswalk using Darwin Core as the central translation layer\nLook for updates on term definitions, controlled value lists, and validation tools\nJoin our discussions on standardizing data fields and contributing to the controlled vocabulary development\n\nFor questions, feedback, or help mapping your dataset, contact the Data Stewardship Unit.\n\nDarwin Core is not a database format.

Built on Apache Spark, it integrates with Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS), Delta Lake, and Synapse Analytics, the core components of the Azure Lakehouse.\nIn this model, Databricks acts as the compute engine, running code while Data Lake Storage and Delta Lake handle scalable, secure data storage. Synapse Analytics adds SQL-based analytics and data warehousing.\nFor DFO, adopting the Lakehouse model eliminates siloed data storage and fragmented code management. Previously, datasets were scattered across systems, and essential data cleaning and analysis code was split across multiple GitHub repositories, making it hard to track, reuse, or standardize. Valuable intermediate data products were often inaccessible. The Lakehouse consolidates data, transformations, and curated datasets, improving collaboration, reproducibility, and transparency.\nNow, analysts can connect directly to the Lakehouse from RStudio (or any IDE) using PATs, gaining seamless, secure access to centralized data with scalable compute. This shift removes past limitations on data access, permissions, and technology use, significantly enhancing DFO‚Äôs analytical capabilities.\nThis guide walks through the setup process, enabling you to connect to Azure Databricks and analyze Lakehouse-stored data using RStudio for code execution, GitHub for version control, and the Lakehouse for data storage and sharing.",

This means that any data access or processing tasks will be performed on Databricks compute resources.\nCode Management: While you can import code from a GitHub repository into a Databricks notebook, you are not able to push code changes back to the repository directly from Databricks.

    "text": "ü§î Why Bother with Controlled Vocabularies and Ontologies?\nIt‚Äôs a fair question. Why invest all this time defining terms, aligning with ontologies, and assigning URIs?\nBecause it unlocks a future where your data works harder for you. Controlled vocabularies and ontologies aren‚Äôt just academic exercises ‚Äî they‚Äôre the foundation for better discovery, smarter integration, and automation across the science lifecycle.\nHere are some tangible ways this work adds value:\n\n\nüîç 1. Enhanced Data Discovery\n\n‚ÄúI know someone collected salmon smolt data‚Ä¶ but where do I find it?‚Äù\n\nBy tagging datasets, columns, and metadata with terms from your SPSI vocabulary, you enable: - Keyword search that actually understands synonyms and related terms - Filters based on data type, units, methods, or ecological domain - Smart discovery interfaces (e.g., ‚ÄúShow me everything related to juvenile survival‚Äù)\n‚û°Ô∏è Example: A data catalog that lets users search by controlled term rather than inconsistent column names across spreadsheets.\n\n\n\nüîÑ 2. Semi-Automated Data Integration\n\n‚ÄúThese datasets report the same metric but use different terms, formats, or units.‚Äù\n\nUsing controlled terms with defined relationships (e.g., broader, exactMatch, hasUnit), you can: - Detect overlapping fields across submissions automatically - Align columns and units across multiple datasets - Standardize value domains (e.g., Red/Green/Amber vs Critical/Stable/Concerned)\n‚û°Ô∏è Example: A script that reads in new FSAR data and automatically maps it to the SPSR schema for validation and loading into a database.\n\n\n\nüß† 3. Smarter Applications (AI & Beyond)\n\n‚ÄúCan‚Äôt AI just figure this stuff out?‚Äù\n\nOnly if you feed it structure.\nControlled vocabularies and ontologies allow you to: - Ground large language models (LLMs) in your domain‚Äôs specific terminology - Build Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems for question answering - Use semantic search tools to find relevant variables, concepts, and datasets - Train AI to assist in metadata generation, anomaly detection, or dataset classification\n‚û°Ô∏è Example: A chatbot that helps scientists describe their data using your vocabulary, or recommends matching fields from existing standards.\n\n\n\nüîó 4. Future-Proof Interoperability\n\n‚ÄúWhat if we want to share this with other agencies or join a broader platform?‚Äù\n\nStandardized vocabularies with persistent URIs and ontology alignments (e.g., with NCEAS, ENVO, OBO) make it easy to: - Share DFO terms with external partners - Convert metadata to international schemas (e.g., Darwin Core, ISO 19115) - Plug into federated data platforms without starting over\n‚û°Ô∏è Example: Publishing your vocabulary to w3id.org lets others reference and reuse your terms as global identifiers.\n\n\n\nüß∞ 5. Better Metadata, Better Stewardship\n\n‚ÄúI just want people to fill out metadata that makes sense.‚Äù\n\nControlled vocabularies: - Reduce ambiguity - Improve machine readability - Make metadata easier to validate and automate\n‚û°Ô∏è Example: A dropdown menu in a data intake form linked to your vocab that auto-fills units, definitions, and example values ‚Äî while storing clean, machine-readable metadata under the hood.",
