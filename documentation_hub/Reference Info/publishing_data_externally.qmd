This guide is intended for scientists and technical staff in the DFO Pacific Region Science Branch. It outlines what is allowed, restricted, or prohibited when using internal and external platforms (e.g., Sharepoint, GitHub, Zenodo, Google Drive) to manage and share DFO Science data, code, and metadata, including during Fishery Science Advisory Report (FSAR) workflows.

For FSAR workflows, we recommend authors save their data in the Sharepoint for the Pacific Salmon Data MS Team. All data should be accompanied by a data dictionary with a README. For resources on creating a data dictionary, please see [our blurb on data standards](https://github.com/dfo-pacific-science/data-stewardship-unit/tree/main/data_standards).
Github can be used to host the code associated with analyses.

Table 1. **External Platform Use Guidelines** for three data classifications of both data and code: Unclassified, Protected A, and Protected B. Note that this table does not cover Protected C or Classified data which are not permitted on external platforms.

| **Platform** | **Unclassified** | **Protected A** | **Protected B** | **Notes** |
|--------------|------------------------|------------------|------------------|----------|
| **SharePoint** | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | SharePoint can also be used to share protected data with external CSAS participants or reviewers by submitting a request for email approval from the Regional Director of Science. Attach approval email to [this Assystnet ticket](http://assystselfservice.ent.dfo-mpo.ca/assystnet/application.jsp#serviceOfferings/285) |
| **GitHub (public repo)** | Code: ‚úÖ yes. Data:‚ö†Ô∏è only allowed after internal DFO release approval | ‚ùå Prohibited | ‚ùå Prohibited | Public GitHub repos are only for non-sensitive code or metadata. Must go through internal DFO public data release process even for unclassified data. |
| **GitHub (private repo)** | ‚úÖ Before release approval and sharing with specific collaborators | ‚ö†Ô∏è Discouraged | ‚ùå Prohibited | Useful for sharing non-sensitive (usally derived) data with external reviewers or CSAS participants; not for Protected data (ie. raw data). |
| **GitHub Codespaces** | ‚úÖ  | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | Don't use for Protected data or model outputs. |
| **GitHub Copilot** | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | Never input Protected code/data. |
| **Zenodo / Figshare / Dryad** | ‚úÖ after FSAR approval | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | Good for quickly getting datasets published with DOIs. Must be followed up with publication to Open Government Portal |
| **GC Data Portal (Open.Canada.ca)** | ‚úÖ Required for final release | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | Official platform for open datasets. Requires release review. |
| **GCcollab / GCshare** | ‚úÖ Internal sharing | ‚úÖ With care | ‚ö†Ô∏è Rare; PB sharing requires approval | Use for internal collaboration

## üîê Data Classification Quick Reference

- **Unclassified**: No expected harm from disclosure. Includes open data, public metadata, and code that contains no sensitive logic or credentials.
  - _Examples_: Published R packages, fish counts aggregated by region and year, habitat model source code without raw data. Note, however, even unclassified data has to be approved for release by the Regional Director of Science.
- **Protected A**: Could cause low-level injury if disclosed (e.g., minor confidentiality breach, operational disruption).
  - _Examples_: Unpublished but non-sensitive biological metrics tied to location or project; fishing effort by vessel class if potentially re-identifiable; unreviewed site-specific model outputs.
- **Protected B**: Could cause serious injury if disclosed (e.g., violation of legal obligations, significant economic harm).
  - _Examples_: Commercial catch by vessel or license number; sensitive species occurrences; data provided under confidentiality agreements.

> üîó Refer to the [Policy on Government Security](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32611) for classification definitions and examples.  
> üîé Unsure if data is protected? Consult your divisional data contact or ATIP office.

## üß≠ Platform-by-Platform Guidance

### ‚úÖ GitHub (Public and Private)
- **Recommended for**: Non-sensitive, unclassified code, metadata schemas, documentation, workflows.
- **Allowed**: Unclassified data/code only. Data must go through the Approvals and Internal publishing process before being posted anywhere public.
- **Private repos**: Use for drafting and collaboration before public release. Do not use for long-term data storage.
- **FSAR Guidance**: Posting of data in a public GitHub repo before FSAR is formally approved by CSAS and before the release has beeing approved by the Regional Director of Science is likely a breach of the Access to Information Act and/or Privacy Act.

> üîó [TBS Directive on Open Government, Section 6.1](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=28108#cha6) ‚Äì Open information by default, subject to security/privacy.
> üîó [DFO Policy for Scientific Data](https://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/about-notre-sujet/publications/science/datapolicy-politiquedonnees/index-eng.html) - " t is the responsibility of the Regional Director of Science to designate specific Data as classified for preventing its open sharing."

---

### üö´ GitHub Codespaces / Copilot
- **Codespaces**: Cloud-hosted dev environments. Not GC-approved for sensitive data. Fine for non-sensitive code.
- **Copilot**: Do not enter Protected data/code. Avoid unless using for generic logic.

> üîó [TBS Guide on Generative AI](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/digital-government-innovations/responsible-use-ai.html) 

---

### ‚úÖ Canadian Integrated Ocean Observing System, Zenodo, Dryad, Figshare
- Use **after FSAR or publication approval**.
- Good for creating DOIs and enabling citation and disseminating broadly.
- Data must be fully unclassified, reviewed, and approved.

---

### ‚úÖ GC Open Data Portal
- **Official repository** for open DFO datasets.
- Requires metadata, data steward approval, and Open Government Licence.

## üßæ Internal DFO Requirements

### üì§ Internal release process
- Managed by the Marine Spatial Data Infrastructure System and the Enterprise Data Hub
[Follow the official steps here](https://intranet.ent.dfo-mpo.ca/science/en/node/1478)

FOr the steps specific to Approvals and Publishing see step 4 for the [Release Criteria Checklist](https://intranet.ent.dfo-mpo.ca/science/sites/science/files/release_criteria_checklist_open_government.pdf)  


### ‚è≥ When to Release?
- **For FSAR-related data**: Only after advice is finalized and report is approved.
- **For code/metadata tools**: May be shared publicly once confirmed to contain no sensitive content.

> üîó [CSAS Procedural Manuals](https://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/csas-sccs/process-processus/index-eng.html) ‚Äì Supporting material must not be released until advice is finalized.
