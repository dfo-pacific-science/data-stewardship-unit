Use this workflow when you need to **add, revise, or align controlled terms** used in salmon datasets, salmon data package metadata, and SPSR uploads.

::: {.callout-note}
This workflow is for **term governance**.

If you are preparing a dataset package and uploading to SPSR, use [Salmon data package + SPSR intake path](../reference_info/data_standards/ontology-data-package-gpt.qmd).
:::

## Canonical source and namespace

- Canonical ontology docs: [GC DFO Salmon Ontology](../reference_info/ontology/formal-documentation.qmd)
- Canonical contributor conventions: [Ontology Conventions Guidebook](../reference_info/ontology/conventions/index.qmd)
- Canonical namespace: `https://w3id.org/gcdfo/salmon#`

## Step 1 — Identify candidate terms from real data

For each candidate term, capture:

- proposed label
- plain-language definition
- where it appears (column name, code list, method field)
- expected usage context (FSAR, SPSR wizard, reporting)
- source/provenance reference (document, method spec, report)

## Step 2 — Check existing ontology and vocabularies first

Before proposing anything new:

1. Search WIDOCO for exact or close matches.
2. Check existing concept schemes and synonyms.
3. Decide whether your candidate is:
   - existing term (reuse as-is)
   - synonym/label variant (add lexical support)
   - genuinely new concept (new term needed)

## Step 3 — Choose the right modeling type

- Use **OWL classes/properties** for domain entities and logical relations.
- Use **SKOS concepts** for controlled code lists and enumerations.
- Do not model the same concept as both OWL class and SKOS concept unless there is an explicit architecture decision.

## Step 4 — Prepare a term request package

Minimum required fields:

- preferred label
- definition (`IAO:0000115` for OWL or `skos:definition` for SKOS)
- provenance (`IAO:0000119` and/or `dcterms:source` when available)
- owner/theme/module
- example usage
- requested placement (parent class, scheme membership, broader term)

## Step 5 — Review and decision

Apply a light governance check:

- no duplicate meaning
- definition is testable and non-circular
- naming is consistent
- aligns with competency questions and downstream workflows
- impact on salmon data package and SPSR workflows is documented

## Step 6 — Implement and publish

After approval:

1. Add/update ontology term(s).
2. Regenerate ontology docs and release artifacts.
3. Update DSU docs if contributor guidance changed.
4. Update downstream mappings/templates as needed.

## Step 7 — Sync downstream systems (including SPSR)

When term changes affect intake:

- update salmon data package templates (`column_dictionary.csv`, `codes.csv` examples)
- update SPSR upload guidance and controlled-value references
- run one end-to-end test through SPSR wizard with the updated term usage

Useful SPSR references:

- Repo: <https://github.com/dfo-pacific-science/salmon-population-summary-repository>
- In-app documentation hub: <https://spsr.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/documentation/>
- Upload wizard: <https://spsr.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/wizard/1/>

## Quick checklist

- [ ] Existing term reuse checked first
- [ ] Correct OWL vs SKOS modeling choice
- [ ] Definition + provenance complete
- [ ] Downstream salmon data package/SPSR impacts assessed
- [ ] Docs and examples updated
