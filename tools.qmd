This page lists practical tools used across the FADS Open Science Hub workflows.

## Core platforms

### Salmon Population Summary Repository (SPSR)

Operational intake and exploration platform for salmon population data, including wizard-based contribution flows.

- Docs hub: <https://spsr.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/documentation/>
- Upload wizard: <https://spsr.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/wizard/1/>
- Repo: <https://github.com/dfo-pacific-science/salmon-population-summary-repository>

### DFO Salmon Ontology

Canonical semantic source for terms and identifiers.

## Packaging and validation

### Salmon Data Exchange Package (SDEP)

Metadata package structure used across standards and intake workflows.

- Spec: [Salmon Data Exchange Package](reference_info/data_standards/salmon-data-exchange-package.qmd)
- Intake guidance: [SDEP + SPSR Intake Path](reference_info/data_standards/ontology-data-package-gpt.qmd)

### metasalmon

R-based tooling for validating and working with SDEP-style metadata.

- Hub context: [R Packages](reference_info/tools/r_packages.qmd)
