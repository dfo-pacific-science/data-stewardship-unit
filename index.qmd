# FADS Documentation Hub 🐟💾

Welcome to the [Fishery & Assessment Data Section (FADS)](https://086gc.sharepoint.com/sites/FisheryAssessmentDataSectionWiki/SitePages/CollabHome.aspx) Documentation Hub! \
\
The Documentation hub is created by the [**Data Stewardship Unit**](about.qmd) and hosts resources for Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) employees in the Pacific Region Science Branch. 🌊🔬🌲

This site is your go-to resource for everything related to data stewardship and data management. Whether you're wrangling spreadsheets, designing a database, writing metadata, or just trying to figure out where to start — we’ve got you covered. 💪📊

We follow the [**Diátaxis Framework**](https://diataxis.fr) to keep things organized, useful, and easy to navigate. The docs are grouped into four clear categories:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### ️1. How-to Guides 🛠

Perfect for when you're asking:\

-   How to clean up an Excel file before uploading 🧼

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### 2. Reference Info 📘

The deep, detailed, no-fluff facts about tools, terms, and standards.\
Use these when you need precision or technical definitions.

Ideal for onboarding or skill-building.
