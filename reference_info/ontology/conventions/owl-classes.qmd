Derived from canonical `docs/CONVENTIONS.md` in the `dfo-salmon-ontology` repo.

## Required pattern

Every class should include:

- `a owl:Class`
- `rdfs:label "..."@en`
- `IAO:0000115 "..."@en`
- `rdfs:isDefinedBy <https://w3id.org/gcdfo/salmon>`

Optional but recommended:

- `IAO:0000119` (text citation)
- `dcterms:source` (resolvable source URI)
- `IAO:0000112` (example usage)

## Authoring template

```turtle
:ConservationUnit a owl:Class ;
  rdfs:label "Conservation Unit"@en ;
  IAO:0000115 "A biologically meaningful salmon management unit used for conservation and assessment."@en ;
  rdfs:isDefinedBy <https://w3id.org/gcdfo/salmon> ;
  IAO:0000119 "DFO policy source text"@en ;
  dcterms:source <https://example.org/source> .
```

## Hierarchy guidance

- Use `rdfs:subClassOf` for true “is-a” relationships.
- Use `owl:disjointWith` when classes are mutually exclusive.
- Use `owl:equivalentClass` only when meanings are truly identical.

## Common mistakes to avoid

- definition repeating label without adding meaning
- creating duplicate classes for the same concept
- using instance examples as class definitions
- mixing SKOS concept semantics into class axioms without design intent

## Quick quality checks

- [ ] clear singular label
- [ ] non-circular definition
- [ ] correct parent class
- [ ] provenance included when available
