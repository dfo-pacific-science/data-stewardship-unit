## Minimal provenance pattern

Use these fields consistently:

- `IAO:0000115` — term definition text (required)
- `IAO:0000119` — textual source/citation for definition (optional)
- `dcterms:source` — resolvable URI for source material (optional but preferred)
- `rdfs:isDefinedBy <https://w3id.org/gcdfo/salmon>` (required)

## Keep identifiers and codes distinct

- `dcterms:identifier` = textual internal identifier (when used)
- `skos:notation` = scheme code (typed literal)
- labels are human-facing and should not carry machine IDs/codes

## Maintenance cadence

For every material ontology update:

1. update/add terms with required annotations
2. validate consistency and quality checks
3. regenerate docs/release artifacts
4. update DSU guidebook pages if conventions changed
5. communicate downstream impact (salmon data package templates, SPSR guidance, validators)

## Quality checks before merge

- [ ] required annotation fields present
- [ ] provenance fields are meaningful (not placeholders)
- [ ] no duplicate concept labels with conflicting definitions
- [ ] hierarchy/scheme placement reviewed
- [ ] release notes prepared for user-facing changes
