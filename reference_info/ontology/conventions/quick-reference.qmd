## Essential elements (minimum)

### OWL terms (classes and properties)

- `rdfs:label "..."@en`
- `IAO:0000115 "..."@en`
- `rdfs:isDefinedBy <https://w3id.org/gcdfo/salmon>`
- optional provenance: `IAO:0000119` and/or `dcterms:source`

### SKOS concepts (controlled vocabulary terms)

- `skos:prefLabel "..."@en`
- `skos:inScheme :YourScheme`
- recommended: `skos:definition "..."@en`
- `rdfs:isDefinedBy <https://w3id.org/gcdfo/salmon>`
- optional code: `skos:notation "CODE"^^ex:CodeDatatype`

## Naming conventions

- Classes: `PascalCase` (e.g., `EscapementMeasurement`)
- Properties: `lowerCamelCase` (e.g., `aboutStock`)
- SKOS concepts: `PascalCase` (e.g., `SonarCounting`)

## Key decision rule: SKOS vs OWL

- use **SKOS** for code lists, picklists, and lexical hierarchies
- use **OWL** for logical class models and inferencing
- avoid modeling the same concept as both unless explicitly approved

## Non-negotiables

- keep ontology schema separate from instance data
- use full canonical IRIs
- do not put codes in labels
- use provenance fields consistently

## Quality gate checklist

- [ ] required annotations present
- [ ] definition is clear and non-circular
- [ ] no duplicate concept introduced
- [ ] placement in hierarchy/scheme is correct
- [ ] examples and provenance included where useful
