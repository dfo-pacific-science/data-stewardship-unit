Use this process when you cannot find a suitable existing term in the DFO Salmon Ontology.

## Before requesting

1. Search existing ontology docs: [GC DFO Salmon Ontology](formal-documentation.qmd)
2. Check conventions: [Ontology Conventions Guidebook](conventions/index.qmd)
3. Confirm the concept is not already represented under another label/synonym.

## Minimum request package

Include:

- proposed label
- plain-language definition
- concept type (OWL class/property or SKOS concept)
- expected parent class or concept scheme
- usage example from a real workflow (FSAR/SPSR/salmon data package)
- provenance/source reference (if available)
- why existing terms are insufficient

## Decision criteria

A strong request should:

- solve a real recurring use case
- avoid semantic duplication
- fit existing naming and modeling conventions
- improve interoperability or data quality

## Suggested issue template

```markdown
## Proposed term
Label: ...
Type: OWL class / OWL property / SKOS concept

## Definition
...

## Placement
Parent class or concept scheme: ...

## Example usage
...

## Why existing terms do not work
...

## Source/provenance
...
```

## After approval

1. Add term in ontology repository.
2. Regenerate docs/release artifacts.
3. Update DSU guidance pages that reference this area.
4. Update salmon data package/SPSR mappings if intake workflows are affected.
