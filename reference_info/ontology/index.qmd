This section provides curated access to **Controlled Vocabularies and Thesauri from the DFO Salmon Ontology**. These human-friendly term tables are generated directly from the ontology source and organized by theme for easy reference.

Each table groups related concepts and classes:

- [Stock Assessment Methods](stock-assessment-terms.qmd) — enumeration and escapement related vocabularies
- [Genetics and GSI](genetics-terms.qmd) — laboratory, assay, and reporting constructs
- [Legislation and Policy](legislation-terms.qmd) — policy frameworks and status designations
- [Biological Benchmarks](benchmarks-terms.qmd) — conservation limits, reference points, and indicators
- [Temporal References](temporal-terms.qmd) — time-based frames such as brood and ocean entry years

For complete **DFO Salmon Ontology documentation** including formal class hierarchies, property definitions, and axiomatic relationships, see the [Widoco-generated documentation](formal-documentation.qmd).

Each themed page shows provenance metadata (source commit and extraction time) so you can verify freshness before exporting or citing the terms.

For CSV consumers, the generated files live at `data/ontology/release/artifacts/term-tables/` alongside metadata JSON payloads.
