title: "Class vs SKOS Concept: Decision Tree"
format: html
---

Use this quick decision tree when modeling a new term.

## Decision tree

1. Is this a controlled value/code list item (picklist term)?
   - **Yes** → model as **SKOS concept**
   - **No** → continue

2. Does it need logical class semantics (subclassing, restrictions, reasoning)?
   - **Yes** → model as **OWL class/property**
   - **No** → continue

3. Is it mostly lexical terminology with broader/narrower relationships?
   - **Yes** → model as **SKOS concept**
   - **No** → model as **OWL class/property**

## Practical examples

- "Sonar counting" as method term in a code list → **SKOS concept**
- "Conservation Unit" as domain entity class → **OWL class**
- "aboutStock" relation between measurement and stock → **OWL object property**

## Guardrails

- avoid modeling the same meaning as both SKOS concept and OWL class by default
- keep SKOS for terminology governance and controlled values
- keep OWL for logical model structure and inferencing
