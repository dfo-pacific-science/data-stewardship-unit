# Reference Guide: Darwin Core, the Unified GBIF Data Model, and OBIS

This guide explains how Darwin Core supports interoperability for Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) salmon data, and how GBIF/OBIS publication models connect to that workflow.

## What is Darwin Core?

**Darwin Core (DwC)** is a biodiversity data standard maintained by [TDWG](https://www.tdwg.org/). It provides common terms for recording occurrences, events, measurements, and related metadata.

## Darwin Core as an interoperability layer

In DFO Pacific science workflows, teams use different local schemas. Darwin Core acts as a **translation layer** so those local datasets can be aligned and shared without forcing one internal database design.

## The Unified GBIF Data Model

The [GBIF Unified Data Model](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QpXwole_j32QZAg6ddqOrAB5OOdqVJKdoKKzz06CK-o/edit?usp=sharing) extends DwC to support linked structures such as:

- Events
- Occurrences
- Measurements/Facts

This is useful for salmon workflows where one program may generate survey events, biological observations, and derived indicators.

## OBIS context

[OBIS](https://obis.org/) applies Darwin Core patterns to marine biodiversity exchange, including marine-focused extensions and publication pathways.

## DFO salmon semantic position

For salmon-specific semantics in this ecosystem:

- treat the **DFO Salmon Ontology** as canonical for term meaning and identifiers
- use Darwin Core terms for interoperability and publication packaging
- map outward to GBIF/OBIS as needed

Canonical ontology entry point:

- [GC DFO Salmon Ontology documentation](ontology/formal-documentation.qmd)

## Example field alignment

| DFO Field / Concept | Darwin Core Term | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `Species_Code` or `Species_Name` | `scientificName` | Resolve against accepted taxonomic services |
| `Sample_ID` | `occurrenceID` | Use stable unique identifiers |
| `Catch_Date` | `eventDate` | Prefer ISO 8601 |
| `Survey_Name` | `eventID` | Use hierarchical event IDs where needed |
| `Latitude`, `Longitude` | `decimalLatitude`, `decimalLongitude` | Use WGS84 |
| `Depth_m` | `minimumDepthInMeters`, `maximumDepthInMeters` | Include both when possible |
| biological metrics | `measurementType`, `measurementValue`, `measurementUnit` | Use controlled value strategy |
| method/protocol | `samplingProtocol` | Keep method terms consistent |

## Practical guidance

- start semantic mapping in DFO ontology terms
- map to DwC publication terms for external interoperability
- keep provenance explicit for transformations and crosswalks

Darwin Core is not your internal data model. It is your interoperability contract.
