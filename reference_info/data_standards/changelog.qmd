### 2026-02-20 — ontology docs consolidation + FSAR/SPSR alignment

- **Area:** ontology + standards hub + workflows
- **Change:** integrated ontology conventions guidebook into DSU docs; retired duplicate term explorer path; rewired standards pages around canonical ontology docs + SDEP + SPSR intake.
- **Reason:** reduce duplication and keep one formal source of truth.
- **Impact:** contributors should use WIDOCO + conventions guidebook for term semantics and use updated FSAR/SPSR workflow pages for intake.

### 2026-02-20 — semantic system entry path made explicit

- **Area:** standardize/publish workflow pages
- **Change:** made DFO Ontology → SDEP → Meta-SALMON-R (MetaSAMN) → Salmon Data GPT → SPSR path prominent at top of key workflow pages.
- **Reason:** make the intended system flow obvious during standardization and publishing.
- **Impact:** data producers should follow the explicit entry path before upload or external release.

- legacy namespace/content patterns in active docs
- broken internal local links in active `.qmd` pages
