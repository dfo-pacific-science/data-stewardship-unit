## 2026-02

### 2026-02-20 — ontology docs consolidation + FSAR/SPSR alignment

- **Area:** ontology + standards hub + workflows
- **Change:** integrated ontology conventions guidebook into DSU docs; retired duplicate term explorer path; rewired standards pages around canonical ontology docs + SDEP + SPSR intake.
- **Reason:** reduce duplication and keep one formal source of truth.
- **Impact:** contributors should use WIDOCO + conventions guidebook for term semantics and use updated FSAR/SPSR workflow pages for intake.
- **Links:**
  - [PR #151](https://github.com/dfo-pacific-science/data-stewardship-unit/pull/151)
  - [GC DFO Salmon Ontology](../ontology/formal-documentation.qmd)
  - [SDEP + SPSR Intake Path](ontology-data-package-gpt.qmd)

### 2026-02-20 — semantic system entry path made explicit

- **Area:** standardize/publish workflow pages
- **Change:** made DFO Ontology → SDEP → metasalmon → Salmon Data GPT → SPSR path prominent at top of key workflow pages.
- **Reason:** make the intended system flow obvious during standardization and publishing.
- **Impact:** data producers should follow the explicit entry path before upload or external release.

  - [Publish Your Data](publish-data.qmd)
  - [The Semantic Salmon Data Ecosystem](semantic-salmon-data-ecosystem.qmd)

### 2026-02-20 — branded semantic start page added

- **Area:** standards IA + homepage/navigation
- **Change:** added a branded front-door page for the full path, with one primary CTA: **Start my FSAR intake path**.
- **Reason:** provide a single obvious entry point before users branch into detailed pages.
- **Impact:** new users can start from one page and follow the canonical sequence without guessing navigation order.
- **Links:**

## Quality checks (CI)

Automated checks are configured to catch:

- legacy namespace/content patterns in active docs
- broken internal local links in active `.qmd` pages

CI workflow file: `.github/workflows/docs-quality.yml`
