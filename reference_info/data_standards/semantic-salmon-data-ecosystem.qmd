# Overview

The **Semantic Salmon Data Ecosystem** (Semantic Salmon System) connects standards, ontology terms, package metadata, validation tooling, and operational upload pathways so salmon data can move from local analysis into reusable systems.

## Entry path (what to use, in order)

```{=html}
<div class="semantic-entry">
  <ol>
    <li><strong>DFO Salmon Ontology</strong> — canonical semantics</li>
    <li><strong>SDEP</strong> — package metadata structure</li>
    <li><strong>Meta-SALMON-R (MetaSAMN)</strong> — validation and quality control</li>
    <li><strong>Salmon Data GPT</strong> — optional drafting/acceleration assistant</li>
    <li><strong>SPSR</strong> — operational intake path for many FSAR workflows</li>
  </ol>
</div>
```

At a high level, the ecosystem has five working parts:

1. **DFO Salmon Ontology** — canonical terms and semantics
2. **SDEP (Salmon Data Exchange Package)** — structured metadata packaging
3. **Validation tooling (Meta-SALMON-R, related checks)** — quality control
4. **SPSR (Salmon Population Summary Repository)** — intake and operational publishing path for many FSAR workflows
5. **Salmon Data GPT / guided assistants (optional)** — acceleration layer for drafting mappings and metadata

# 1. DFO Salmon Ontology (canonical semantic layer)

The ontology provides shared definitions and persistent IRIs for key domain concepts.

- Canonical docs: [GC DFO Salmon Ontology](../ontology/formal-documentation.qmd)
- Contributor guidance: [Ontology Conventions Guidebook](../ontology/conventions/index.qmd)

# 2. SDEP (package layer)

SDEP standardizes package metadata without forcing one rigid dataset schema.

Core files:

- `dataset.csv`
- `tables.csv`
- `column_dictionary.csv`
- `codes.csv` (when controlled values apply)

Spec reference: [Salmon Data Exchange Package Specification](salmon-data-exchange-package.qmd)

# 3. Validation tooling (quality layer)

Validation tooling checks package structure and semantic consistency before submission.

Typical checks include:

- required columns/files present
- value types and requiredness
- IRI formatting and ontology-link consistency
- controlled vocabulary/code-list alignment

# 4. SPSR (operational intake layer)

For FSAR-oriented contributions, SPSR is a major operational destination.

- Docs: <https://spsr.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/documentation/>
- Upload wizard: <https://spsr.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/wizard/1/>
- Templates endpoint: <https://spsr.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/download_sdp_templates>
- Repo: <https://github.com/dfo-pacific-science/salmon-population-summary-repository>

This creates a practical bridge from standards work to real upload and review workflows.

# 5. Guided assistants (optional acceleration)

Assistant tools can help draft mappings and package metadata, but they do not replace validation or governance. They are best used as **drafting aids**.

# 6. End-to-end flow

1. Map terms to ontology IRIs
2. Build SDEP metadata
3. Validate package
4. Upload via SPSR workflow (for applicable FSAR datasets)
5. Iterate from validation/reviewer feedback

# 7. Why this matters

- lower onboarding friction for data producers
- more consistent semantics across teams
- cleaner FSAR-to-repository pathways
- better machine-readability for integration and downstream analytics
