However, if they drop below the USR but remain above the LRP, the stock enters the cautious zone, signaling a need for more conservative management measures to prevent further decline.",https://waves-vagues.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/library-bibliotheque/40965715.pdf,,Upper stock reference point if known,Number of fish,,nan
