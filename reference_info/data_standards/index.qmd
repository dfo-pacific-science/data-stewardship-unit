Welcome. If you only do one thing today, **reuse published terms by adding URIs to your data dictionary** so escapement and assessment tables stay aligned.

## 1) Do this now — reuse published terms in your data dictionary

- Download the template: [Data Dictionary (xlsx)](data_dictionary_template.xlsx)
- Open the vocabularies: [Controlled Vocabulary & Thesauri](controlled-vocabulary-thesauri.qmd)
- Match your key columns (e.g., CU, brood year, escapement) to published terms and copy their URIs.
- Paste the URIs into your dictionary (use `standard_term_uri` for columns; `concept_scheme_iri` for code lists if applicable).
- Save and ship the dictionary with your data (or send it to DSU for a quick check).

## 2) See it done — worked example with escapement data

- Short demo (2–4 min) showing a CU-year table aligned to the vocabularies. *(Placeholder: add video link.)*
- Example Salmon Data Exchange Package for escapement. *(Placeholder: add example package link.)*
- Optional: validate the package with the R helper once you add URIs.

## 3) Learn the details — standards, ontology, and tools

- What this is: one-page overview. *(Placeholder: add one-pager link.)*
- Controlled vocabularies & thesauri: [Browse terms](controlled-vocabulary-thesauri.qmd)
- Salmon Data Exchange Package: [Specification](salmon-data-exchange-package.qmd)
- DFO Salmon Ontology: [Formal documentation](../ontology/formal-documentation.qmd)
- Tools: R package and Salmon GPT assistant (links coming soon).

Everything else—emails, trainings, newsletters—should point back to this hub so people can act fast, get an example, or dive deeper.
