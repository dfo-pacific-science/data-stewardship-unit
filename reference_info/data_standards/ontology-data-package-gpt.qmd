Use this page when your goal is to move from **mapped data** to a **submission-ready package** and upload path for SPSR.

```{=html}

::: {.callout-note}
This page is for **packaging and intake**.

If you need to propose new vocabulary terms or ontology changes, use [Controlled Vocabulary Governance Workflow](../../tutorials/support_controlled_vocabs.qmd).

## Quick summary

- The **DFO Salmon Ontology** provides canonical term IRIs.
- **SDEP** provides package metadata structure (`dataset.csv`, `tables.csv`, `column_dictionary.csv`, `codes.csv`).
- **Meta-SALMON-R (MetaSAMN)** supports package validation.
- **Salmon Data GPT** can help draft mappings/metadata.
- **SPSR** is a primary operational destination for FSAR-oriented uploads.

Guided assistants can help draft content, but validation remains the quality gate.

## Practical workflow

1. Find canonical terms in [GC DFO Salmon Ontology documentation](../ontology/formal-documentation.qmd).
2. Build `column_dictionary.csv` with full IRIs (no shortened/partial URIs).
3. Assemble package files using [SDEP specification](salmon-data-exchange-package.qmd).
4. Validate locally (e.g., Meta-SALMON-R checks).
5. Prepare SPSR-compatible upload CSV(s).
6. Upload through SPSR wizard and review validation feedback.

## SPSR touchpoints

- App documentation: <https://spsr.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/documentation/>
- Upload wizard: <https://spsr.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/wizard/1/>
- Template package endpoint: <https://spsr.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/download_sdp_templates>
- Repo: <https://github.com/dfo-pacific-science/salmon-population-summary-repository>

## Recommended artifacts

- `dataset.csv` for dataset-level metadata
- `tables.csv` for table inventory and entities
- `column_dictionary.csv` for column semantics + term links
- `codes.csv` for controlled value sets
- upload-ready data CSV(s) matching your selected intake profile

## Validation gates

Before upload, confirm:

- all required metadata fields are present
- all semantic links use canonical full IRIs
- categorical values are mapped to controlled concepts
- provenance notes are present for major transformations
