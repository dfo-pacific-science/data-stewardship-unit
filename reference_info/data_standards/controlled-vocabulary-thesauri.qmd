## This page has been retired

To reduce duplication and keep one source of truth, the term explorer previously hosted here has been retired from active navigation.

Use these canonical pages instead:

- **Formal ontology reference (WIDOCO):** [GC DFO Salmon Ontology](../ontology/formal-documentation.qmd)
- **User-first contributor docs:** [Ontology Conventions Guidebook](../ontology/conventions/index.qmd)

If you need a new DSU-native term explorer in future, we can add a lighter version that reads directly from ontology release artifacts while still treating WIDOCO as canonical.
