    "text": "2. Deep Dive into Reference Points and Benchmarks in Stock Assessment\n\nBenchmarks vs Reference Points\n\nWSP Benchmarks (UBM, LBM): Derived from productivity models or empirical data. They are biological in nature and specific to a Conservation Unit (CU).\n\nUBM often corresponds to spawner abundance giving Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) or similar.\nLBM often relates to serious harm thresholds, such as a 50% probability of recovery under management actionHolt et al. 2009 Indica….\n\nPrecautionary Approach Reference Points (USR, LRP): Defined at the Stock Management Unit (SMU) level, which aggregates multiple CUs. The LRP is legally required under the amended Fisheries Act.\n\nThe SMU-level LRP is often derived using the probability that all component CUs are above their respective LBM—commonly at ≥50% probability (Holt et al. 2023)….\nHow a Lower Benchmark Relates to the LRP\nThe CU-level LBM becomes the statistical input for deriving the SMU-level LRP. Specifically:\n\nLRPs can be derived via logistic regression models estimating the probability that all CUs within an SMU exceed their LBMs given a level of aggregate abundance (Holt et al. 2023)\nThis integrates the WSP framework into the Fisheries Act mandate for setting LRPs.\n\nIn essence, LRP ≈ aggregate abundance where there’s ≥50% chance all CUs are above their LBM (Holt et al. 2023)\n\n\nSpawner-Recruitment (SR) Based Approaches\nThe gold standard for benchmark estimation when sufficient data are available.\n\na. Ricker Model\nThe most commonly used model for Pacific salmon: - Equation:\n\\[\nR = S \\cdot e^{(a - bS + \\varepsilon)}\n\\]\n\nWhere…\n\n\\(R\\): Number of recruits (offspring that survive to a specific life stage)\n\\(S\\): Number of spawners (parents that produced the recruits)\n\\(a\\): Log-scale productivity parameter; reflects the average number of recruits per spawner at low population density\n\\(b\\): Density-dependence parameter; determines how rapidly recruitment decreases as spawner abundance increases\n\\(\\varepsilon\\): Process error term accounting for environmental or stochastic variation not explained by the model\n\n\n\nb. Benchmarks Derived From SR Models\n\nLower Benchmark (LRP):\n\nOften set at ( S_{GEN} ): spawner abundance that leads to the LRP (e.g., ( S_{MSY} )) in one generation.\nOr, alternatively, a % of ( S_{MSY} ) (e.g., 40%).\n\nUpper Benchmark (USR):\n\nOften set at 80% of ( S_{MSY} ) or similar.\n\nTarget (TRP):\n\nUsually near ( S_{MSY} ), or the escapement yielding maximum sustainable yield.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternative Methods\n\nc. Percentile-Based Approaches\nUsed when data is limited: - Lower Benchmark: 25th percentile historical abundance. - Upper Benchmark: 50th or 75th percentile historical abundance.\n\n\nd. Risk-Based Approaches\n\nUse Monte Carlo or stochastic simulations to assess risk thresholds by repeatedly sampling from uncertainty distributions.\nSimulations quantify the likelihood of stocks falling below defined critical thresholds (LRP).\nBenchmarks are selected to ensure a low probability (e.g., ≤5%) of breaching critical thresholds under various plausible scenarios.\n\n\n\ne. Closed-Loop Simulations (Management Strategy Evaluation - MSE)\n\nUtilize simulation frameworks to test effectiveness and robustness of different management strategies and Harvest Control Rules (HCRs).\nIncorporate uncertainties explicitly:\n\nObservation errors: uncertainties in monitoring and data collection.\nImplementation variability: differences between planned and actual management actions.\nEnvironmental stochasticity: variability due to environmental factors and climate change.\n\nOutcomes evaluated include biological sustainability, economic viability, and compliance with conservation objectives.",

    "section": "🤔 Why Bother with Controlled Vocabularies and Ontologies?",
    "text": "🤔 Why Bother with Controlled Vocabularies and Ontologies?\nIt’s a fair question. Why invest all this time defining terms, aligning with ontologies, and assigning URIs?\nBecause it unlocks a future where your data works harder for you. Controlled vocabularies and ontologies aren’t just academic exercises — they’re the foundation for better discovery, smarter integration, and automation across the science lifecycle.\nHere are some tangible ways this work adds value:\n\n\n🔍 1. Enhanced Data Discovery\n\n“I know someone collected salmon smolt data… but where do I find it?”\n\nBy tagging datasets, columns, and metadata with terms from your SPSI vocabulary, you enable: - Keyword search that actually understands synonyms and related terms - Filters based on data type, units, methods, or ecological domain - Smart discovery interfaces (e.g., “Show me everything related to juvenile survival”)\n➡️ Example: A data catalog that lets users search by controlled term rather than inconsistent column names across spreadsheets.\n\n\n\n🔄 2. Semi-Automated Data Integration\n\n“These datasets report the same metric but use different terms, formats, or units.”\n\nUsing controlled terms with defined relationships (e.g., broader, exactMatch, hasUnit), you can: - Detect overlapping fields across submissions automatically - Align columns and units across multiple datasets - Standardize value domains (e.g., Red/Green/Amber vs Critical/Stable/Concerned)\n➡️ Example: A script that reads in new FSAR data and automatically maps it to the SPSR schema for validation and loading into a database.\n\n\n\n🧠 3. Smarter Applications (AI & Beyond)\n\n“Can’t AI just figure this stuff out?”\n\nOnly if you feed it structure.\nControlled vocabularies and ontologies allow you to: - Ground large language models (LLMs) in your domain’s specific terminology - Build Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems for question answering - Use semantic search tools to find relevant variables, concepts, and datasets - Train AI to assist in metadata generation, anomaly detection, or dataset classification\n➡️ Example: A chatbot that helps scientists describe their data using your vocabulary, or recommends matching fields from existing standards.\n\n\n\n🔗 4. Future-Proof Interoperability\n\n“What if we want to share this with other agencies or join a broader platform?”\n\nStandardized vocabularies with persistent URIs and ontology alignments (e.g., with NCEAS, ENVO, OBO) make it easy to: - Share DFO terms with external partners - Convert metadata to international schemas (e.g., Darwin Core, ISO 19115) - Plug into federated data platforms without starting over\n➡️ Example: Publishing your vocabulary to w3id.org lets others reference and reuse your terms as global identifiers.\n\n\n\n🧰 5. Better Metadata, Better Stewardship\n\n“I just want people to fill out metadata that makes sense.”\n\nControlled vocabularies: - Reduce ambiguity - Improve machine readability - Make metadata easier to validate and automate\n➡️ Example: A dropdown menu in a data intake form linked to your vocab that auto-fills units, definitions, and example values — while storing clean, machine-readable metadata under the hood."

Rather than creating new hierarchies, you should align with existing NCEAS patterns where appropriate.\nIntegration Strategy: Use NCEAS classes as superclasses for your DFO classes where there’s semantic alignment, while maintaining your domain-specific focus on stock assessment and management.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrimary Focus: General salmon biology, ecology, and fisheries\nGeographic Scope: Alaska and Pacific salmon (SASAP data portal)\nTemporal Scope: Historical and current data\nInstitutional Context: NCEAS (National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoot Class: odo:SALMON_00000127 -

coverage: Has measurement types, fishery types, equipment, water bodies, age classes\nAcademic foundation: NCEAS is a research institution with scientific credibility\nGeographic scope: Covers Alaska and Pacific salmon (broader than just DFO)\nDomain expertise: Focuses on general salmon biology, ecology, and fisheries\nEstablished hierarchies: Well-developed classification systems for key domain concepts\n\n\n\n\n\nGeographic bias: Currently focused on Alaska/Pacific (SASAP data portal)\nAcademic focus: May not include management/policy concepts needed by government agencies\nInstitutional ownership: NCEAS controls the ontology, which could limit other organizations’ influence\nScope boundaries: Need to define what belongs in domain ontology vs organization-specific ontologies\nMaintenance responsibility: Single institution responsible for maintaining comprehensive domain ontology\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral biological concepts: Basic salmon biology, ecology, and life history\nEnvironmental concepts: Water bodies, habitats, environmental conditions\nStandard measurements: Common biological measurements and parameters\nEquipment and gear: Standard fishing and survey equipment\n\n\n\n\n\nMeasurement types and methods: If expanded to include more organizations’ approaches\nSurvey protocols: If standardized across organizations\nAnalytical methods: If based on widely-accepted scientific standards\nClassification schemes: If based on scientific consensus\n\n\n\n\n\nManagement and policy concepts: Not in scope for academic research ontology\nOrganization-specific procedures: Too specific for general domain ontology\nRegulatory frameworks: Too specific to particular jurisdictions\nInstitutional structures: Too specific to particular organizations\n\n\n\n\n\nYES - NCEAS can serve as a cross-organizational domain ontology for general salmon biology, ecology, and fisheries concepts, but it should be complemented by organization-specific ontologies for management and policy concepts.\nRationale:\n\nComplementary approach: Domain ontology + organization-specific ontologies\nClear boundaries: General concepts in NCEAS, specific concepts in organizational ontologies\nShared governance: Multiple organizations contribute to and benefit from domain ontology\nMaintained specificity: Organizations retain control over their specific concepts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPriority 1: Measurement Hierarchy (2 classes)\n\ndfo:GeneticDiversity → odo:SALMON_00000167 (measurement type)\ndfo:Fecundity → odo:SALMON_00000167 (measurement type)\n\nPriority 2: Fishery Hierarchy (1 class)\n\ndfo:MixedStockFishery → odo:SALMON_00000137 (Fishery type)\n\nImplementation Steps:\n\nReview NCEAS class definitions for semantic alignment\nUpdate DFO ontology with new subclass relationships\nValidate logical consistency\nUpdate documentation\n\n\n\n\nTask: Examine dfo:Recruitment relationship to NCEAS age class recruits\nAnalysis Questions:\n\nIs recruitment a process, a measurement, or an age class concept?\nHow does DFO’s recruitment concept align with NCEAS age class recruits?\nWhat is the semantic relationship between these concepts?\n\nDeliverables:\n\nSemantic alignment analysis\nRecommendation for integration approach\nImplementation plan if integration is recommended\n\n\n\n\nTask: Document

perspectives\nMitigation: Establish governance framework for coordination\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStrategy: Clearly document which terms depend on NCEAS\nImplementation: Maintain dependency documentation\nBenefit: Clear understanding of external dependencies\n\n\n\n\n\nStrategy: Establish process to monitor NCEAS changes\nImplementation: Automated monitoring system\nBenefit: Early warning of potential issues\n\n\n\n\n\nStrategy: Carefully review class definitions and relationships\nImplementation: Regular validation of semantic alignment\nBenefit: Ensure correct reasoning and

Optimized for managers (clarity) and analysts (evidence) with progressive disclosure starting from CU-level detail to high-level SMU aggregation and advice flow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoal: Rapid assurance that the evidence underpinning advice is defensible, current, and policy-ready. Need to answer “Are we policy-ready and defensible today?” and “What changed since the last FSAR?”\nStories: Select SMU + Year → see Policy & Legal Readiness panel with hard gates; Evidence Completeness gauge; Delta since last FSAR summary; download Advice Trace Pack for briefing/audit.\nKPI Widgets: Coverage (% SMUs with current FSAR), WSP status zone distribution, below-LRP triggers, evidence completeness (Complete / Gaps / Missing-Critical), timeliness (last update date)\nAcceptance: Policy & Legal Readiness panel (hard gate on “Ready”):\n\nWSP status zone for the SMU (with explicit mapping to LRP/USR and how assessed this cycle)\nPrecautionary Approach compliance: harvest control rule named + parameterized, with source & version\nFisheries Act Fish Stocks provisions: below-LRP indicator (Yes/No), if Yes → Rebuilding Plan link + plan version/date\nEvidence Completeness reports Ready when all required evidence + policy gates pass; Partial when optional items missing; Blocked when required items missing\nDelta since last FSAR (mandatory in Advice Trace Pack and on screen): Changed benchmarks, methods/code versions, data additions/removals, status zone, advice/rationale\nExport downloads the pack with structured deltas vs. previous FSAR\nAC: Exec sees a red “Policy trigger” chip whenever an SMU is below LRP and a Rebuilding Plan link is present\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoal: Ensure narrative coherence, benchmark justification, proxy rationale, and reviewer response integration for submission-ready FSARs.\nResponsibilities: Narrative coherence, benchmark justification, proxy rationale, reviewer response integration\nStories: Generate submission-ready trace packs with benchmarks, uncertainty notes, proxy decisions, and methods provenance; integrate reviewer feedback; ensure policy compliance.\nAcceptance: AC: Lead Author can generate a “submission-ready” trace pack with benchmarks, uncertainty notes, proxy decisions, and methods provenance in ≤2 clicks.\n\n\n\n\n\nGoal: Verify methods, benchmarks, reproducibility; confirm uncertainty handling and scientific rigor.\nStories: Open Method → view parameters for both analytical and field methods (including field method downgrade criteria and Estimate Type Classification for specific SENs) + exact code commit/tag/or dataset DOI; inspect Benchmarks as first-class entities with derivation evidence; toggle Uncertainty overlay to confirm GSI/CI presence and propagation; review CU inclusion/exclusion transparency.\nOne-click panels for: benchmark derivation (type, value, method, sensitivity flags), uncertainty treatment (CIs/probabilities), GSI usage (used?, n, misassignment/CI), and downgrade criteria used\nAcceptance: Method shows name/protocol/version/parameters + link to exact commit/tag/DOI used by figures/status. Benchmarks as explicit entities (dfo:LowerBenchmark, dfo:UpperBenchmark, dfo:TargetReference) with:\n\nDerivation method, input dataset(s), time window, uncertainty method, and version/date\nBack-calculable query (stored SPARQL and/or R script call) to regenerate the estimate\nReference Points include type/value/derivation + benchmark method; sensitivity flagged\nUncertainty overlay badges missing GSI, sample sizes, or status CIs; click reveals missing fields\nCU Accounting: CU list for the SMU explicitly lists included, excluded, and proxied CUs with machine-readable justification; GSI usage (Yes/No), sample sizes, and assignment uncertainty\nDowngrade Criteria: Display downgrade criteria (from SKOS scheme) and make violations/assumptions visible\nAC: Reviewer can verify benchmark method & code version; GSI sample size & uncertainty are visible where relevant\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoal: Ensure data standards are met (terms, provenance, data quality, uncertainty); fail fast; identify missing metadata or poor data stewardship practices to help support FSAR authors meet best practices. Ship FSARs quickly. Upload draft data to check for compliance, completeness etc.\nStories:\n\nStart a new submission via a Metadata Intake wizard: select SMU + Year, fill required metadata using controlled‑vocab dropdowns sourced from SKOS, attach Excel/CSV.\nClick Validate to run SHACL + R validator; see inline errors (row/column, severity, code, fix‑hint); correct and re‑validate until state = Ready.\nSave/resume drafts; download a tailored Excel template for the selected scope (Population, CU, SMU, Indicator Stock, PFMA) pre‑filled with valid enumerations.\nOpen Evidence Drawer for provenance minimum and submission audit (who/when, validator versions).\n\nAcceptance:\n\nValidator gating: “Ready” is blocked unless all required metadata are present: method registry term + version, benchmark derivation record, data coverage window, unit + scale, provenance (PROV-O), and person‑time stamps (who/when).\nError contract: Validation returns structured errors with severity (critical/optional), row/column/file, error code, message, and fix‑hint; non‑zero on critical errors; zero only when Ready.\nControlled‑vocab enforcement for spawner_origin, data_source_type, reference_point_type, downgrade_criterion via SKOS schemes in graph:vocab; off‑list values rejected with friendly messages.\nProvenance minimum is visible at the top of the submission and in the Evidence Drawer: data_source, method, code_version/hash, reviewer, date.\nSchema alignment: SPSR fields align with validator and FSAR reporting (explicit LRP/USR/TR records, status decision + rationale, CI fields).\nSubmission lifecycle: Draft → Validated → Ready → Ingested, with audit events (who/when/tool versions). Human review and approval required before ingestion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStory: As a Reviewer, I need to verify that all reference points have transparent derivation methods and sensitivity flags.\nAcceptance Criteria: - Add controlled vocab for reference_point_type (e.g., LRP/USR/Sgen/Smsy) and benchmark_method - AC: Benchmarks must display type, value, method, sensitivity flags, and link to method/code provenance\n\n\n\nStory: As a Lead Author, I need to document CU inclusion decisions and proxy justifications with reviewer sign-off.\nAcceptance Criteria: - Add a CU inclusion/proxy table with fields: decision (included/excluded/proxied), justification, reviewer, review_date - AC: Any CU ≠ “included” requires justification + reviewer sign-off or it fails validation (flagged Missing-Critical)\n\n\n\nStory: As a Reviewer, I need to assess GSI usage and assignment uncertainty for mixed-stock fisheries.\nAcceptance Criteria: - Add fields: gsiUsed (bool), gsiSampleSize (int), gsiAssignmentUncertainty (text/CI or % misID), baseline_reference - AC: If stock is mixed-fishery AND gsiUsed = false → show risk chip (“No GSI apportionment”) and require rationale\n\n\n\nStory: As a Reviewer, I need to verify that key estimates include confidence intervals or documented rationale for absence.\nAcceptance Criteria: - Add status_confidence (probabilities/CI) and downgradeReason (controlled list) for quality-downgraded inputs - AC: Key estimates must include CI or flagged rationale for absence; status shows P(Green/Amber/Red) or a CI note\n\n\n\nStory: As an Executive, I need to ensure compliance with Fisheries Act Fish Stocks provisions and rebuilding requirements.\nAcceptance Criteria: - Add explicit checks: belowLRP (bool), RebuildingPlanURL, hcrIdentifier/hcrParameters - AC: belowLRP = true requires a valid Rebuilding Plan link or shows Missing-Critical\n\n\n\n\nSingle page flow focused on clarity and drill‑downs.

Includes a /docs/ subfolder with cached PDFs if allowed and an optional /data/ folder if toggled.\n\nThis will be an interactive hierarchical tree style graph with progressive disclosure. The initial view shows all CUs for the selected SMU flowing to the SMU and then to Advice, with Management Decision and Legal Framework appearing as sub-nodes when Advice is expanded. Clicking any node reveals additional nodes and specific details in the Evidence Drawer. We need rich relationships (e.g., multiple datasets feeding multiple methods) and should use a node‑link view with a toggle for specific profiles for Biologist/Scientist, Data Steward/Custodian, and Executive/Director which shows different levels of details depending on their persona. Use Cytoscape.js or D3 or other custom javascript as needed.\n\n\n\n\nEvidence badges: Summarize evidence presence/quality for the decision context at each node:\nComplete = all required evidence present; Gaps = optional elements missing; Missing‑Critical = required evidence missing. These roll up SHACL/validator results and CQ checks. (Does not imply review approval.)\nRisk chips: Compact flags tied to specific CQs (e.g., proxy justification missing, no status CI). Clicking a chip focuses the Drawer on the missing field(s).\nEvidence Drawer: The audit lens—shows the who/what/when/how for the selected node: datasets, parameters, reference‑point derivations, code commit, reviewer/date, and links to figures or repos.\nDocuments: Surface authoritative downloads (FSAR, Technical Reports, Research Documents). Each item shows doc type, title, doc number/identifier, issued date, version, size, and a canonical URL/DOI; if internal, use a pre‑signed URL. A small badge indicates Public or Internal.\nCurrency tab: Shows last‑updated and version pins per component; highlights stale items with thresholds (e.g., &gt;12 months).\nDrill‑down: From Drawer items (e.g., a dataset row, code commit, or document), jump to the source in SPSR (record view), GRD (run/sample), CSAS/DFO publications page, or GitHub (exact commit/tag) or Zenodo Release. Breadcrumbs let you pop back to the node.\n\n\n\n\n\nHeader (Intake mode): “Start New Submission” with SMU + Year selectors.\nStep 1 — Metadata form: Controlled‑vocab dropdowns for spawner_origin, data_source_type, reference_point_type, downgrade_criterion (SKOS in graph:vocab); provenance minimum fields pinned.\nStep 2 — Attach files: Upload .xlsx (current accepted format). Parse Metadata tab first; show a preview of parsed metadata fields.\nStep 3 — Validate: Run SHACL + R validator; render inline errors (severity, row/col, code, fix‑hint). Provide “Re‑run validation” and “Download error report”.\nStep 4 — Ready & Submit: When no critical errors remain, mark Ready. Submissions require human review/approval before ingest to SPSR.\nUtilities: “Download tailored template” endpoint pre‑seeds enumerations and column headers by scope (Population, CU, SMU, Indicator Stock, PFMA); “Save draft” persists current progress.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStory: As a Data Steward, I need targeted error reporting with fix-hints to resolve validation issues efficiently.\nAcceptance Criteria: - Add row/column targeted errors with fix-hints, and mark error severity (Critical/High/Info) - Provide template tabs for read-only vocab sheets (RP types, methods, status zones) powering data validation dropdowns - AC: Authors resolve all Critical errors locally; validator returns 0 Critical before upload is permitted\n\n\n\nStory: As a Data Steward, I need guided upload with preview and validation feedback to ensure data quality.\nAcceptance Criteria: - Add guided upload: preview parsed rows, validation report inline, diff vs last submission, idempotent re-upload - AC: Users can correct flagged fields in-app or re-upload; system preserves stable IDs for re-uploads\n\n\n\nStory: As a Reviewer, I need quick access to all evidence links and citation information.\nAcceptance Criteria: - Add quick links to dataset DOI, code commit/DOI, method concept; copy citation button; peek of data dictionary fields - AC: From any status tile, user can open drawer and reach all evidence links ≤2 clicks\n\n\n\nStory: As an Executive, I need visual indicators of coverage and completeness at a glance.\nAcceptance Criteria: - Add filterable risk chips (e.g., Missing CI, No GSI, Proxy w/o review, Below LRP w/o plan) - Add Evidence Completeness gauge per SMU (Complete / Gaps / Missing-Critical) and section-level mini-gauges - AC: Executive sees coverage and completeness at a glance; Reviewer filters by risk type to accelerate audits\n\n\n\nStory: As a Data Steward, I need flexible vocab management that doesn’t block workflow when new terms are needed.\nAcceptance Criteria: - Add inline pickers for methods/benchmarks; Suggest a new term creates a temporary local mapping and queues curation - AC: Off-list entries can’t block; they’re tracked and reconciled later (with audit trail)\n\n\n\nStory: As a Lead Author, I need to track changes between cycles and generate comparison reports.\nAcceptance Criteria: - Add change-log auto-generation (data/method/benchmark/status/advice) + cycle diff view - AC: Lead Author can export a Change Summary page between cycles\n\n\n\nStory: As a user with accessibility needs, I need the interface to be usable with assistive technologies and printable.\nAcceptance Criteria: - Add color-blind-safe status palette, keyboard navigation, structured headings, printable Advice Trace Pack - AC: Trace Pack includes figures + evidence appendix with live links\n\n\n\nData Product Ontology Integration:\n\nQuestion: How should we integrate the Data Product Ontology (DPROD) to handle dataset management instead of using generic Dataset classes?\nInvestigation needed: Map existing DFO Salmon Ontology classes to DPROD’s DataProduct, DataService, Distribution, and Dataset classes for standardized data product representation.\n\nCore Entity Questions (Requiring Investigation):\n\nData Products: How should we model data products using DPROD vs. existing dfo:EscapementMeasurement hierarchy?\nAnalysis Processes: Should we replace dfo:GSIRun with dfo:AnalysisRun to better represent genetic analysis processes?\nScientific Outputs: What is the most appropriate term for scientific advice/recommendations? (Investigate DFO CSAS terminology)\nDecision Support: Is DecisionContext the right term, or would Decision be sufficient for management decision support?\nSIL/SEN Integration: How should we align with Minh Doan’s PR for Stream Inspection Logs (SIL) and Escapement Narratives (SEN) terms?\n\nRelations (PROV‑O flavored): StatusAssessment used DataProduct/ReferencePoint, StatusAssessment wasGeneratedBy Method, ScientificOutput wasDerivedFrom StatusAssessment, ScientificOutput supports Decision, Figure wasDerivedFrom {DataProduct,Method}.\nWSP Rapid-Status Support:\nThe ontology now supports WSP rapid-status assessments via fsar:WSPMetric, fsar:MetricBenchmark, and fsar:AlgorithmThreshold classes. The dfo:StockAssessment class links to WSP metrics via fsar:assessesMetric, and produces rapid statuses via fsar:producesRapidStatus with confidence categories via fsar:hasConfidence. Decision requirement patterns from v3 (e.g., fsar:RebuildingPlanRequirement) work with WSP trigger conditions linking metric positions to policy obligations.\n\n\n\n\nThe FSAR Tracer now supports WSP rapid-status assessments through integration with the Learning Tree 3 decision-tree algorithm. This support enables tracking of the four standard WSP metrics, their benchmarks and algorithm thresholds, rapid status assignments, and confidence categories.\nFour Standard WSP Metrics:\n\nAbsolute Abundance: Compares generational average spawner abundance to COSEWIC criterion D1 thresholds. Lower benchmark: 1,000 spawners; Upper benchmark: 10,000 spawners.\nRelative Abundance: Compares generational average spawner abundance to CU-specific benchmarks (typically Sgen lower, 80% SMSY upper, or habitat capacity-based).\nLong-Term Trend: Compares current generational average to long-term average spawner abundance. Lower benchmark: 50% of long-term average; Upper benchmark: 75% of long-term average.\nPercent Change: Quantifies linear change in spawner abundance over the most recent three generations. Lower benchmark: -25%; Upper benchmark: -15%.\n\nLearning Tree 3 Decision-Tree Integration:\nThe Learning Tree 3 algorithm assigns rapid statuses (Red, Amber, Green) based on metric values and availability. The algorithm uses threshold values that differ from metric benchmarks by design, incorporating buffers and precautionary adjustments based on expert processes and CART analyses.\nMetric Benchmarks vs. Algorithm Thresholds:\nAlgorithm thresholds intentionally diverge from benchmarks in several places:\n\nAbsolute Abundance: Benchmark lower threshold is 1,000 spawners (COSEWIC criterion D1), but Learning Tree 3 algorithm uses 1,500 (benchmark plus 500 buffer) to account for uncertainty and how experts treated individual years in generational averages.\nRelative Abundance: Upper benchmark threshold in Learning Tree 3 equals the WSP upper benchmark plus 10% buffer to account for how this metric was treated in WSP integrated status processes.\nLong-Term Trend: Benchmark thresholds are 50% (lower) and 75% (upper), but Learning Tree 3 uses 79% (lower) and 233% (upper). These thresholds emerged from CART analyses and are applied conditionally with other metrics.\nPercent Change: Benchmark lower threshold is -25%, but Learning Tree 3 uses -70% (emerged from CART analyses). This threshold is only applied conditionally when long-term trend &gt;= 79% and absolute abundance &gt;= 10,000.\n\nConfidence Category Output:\nEach rapid status assessment includes a confidence category (High, Medium, or Low):\n\nHigh confidence: Status assigned using absolute abundance or relative abundance metrics (both requiring higher quality data and benchmarks).\nMedium confidence: Status based on long-term trend metrics with some abundance information available.\nLow confidence: Status based on trend metrics alone without abundance benchmarks.\n\nThese confidence ratings are derived from the algorithm branch (node) that determines the status, based on metric availability and data types used.\nDecision Requirements:\nWSP metric positions trigger decision requirements through fsar:Condition patterns that link to fsar:DecisionRequirement classes. For example, when rapid status is Red (below LRP), this triggers rebuilding plan requirements mandated by the Fisheries Act Fish Stocks Provisions.\n\n\n\n\n\nA1. Benchmarks: Each SMU year must include at least one LRP and one USR entity with derivation metadata (method, inputs, time window), version/DOI or commit, and an executable regeneration link (stored query or code pointer). Benchmarks must display type, value, method, sensitivity flags, and link to method/code provenance.\nA2. Uncertainty: Status decision must include interval or categorical uncertainty; where estimates are downgraded, the downgrade criterion (from SKOS scheme) is recorded and shown. Key estimates must include CI or flagged rationale for absence; status shows P(Green/Amber/Red) or a CI note.\nA3. Policy & Legal Readiness: “Ready” requires: WSP zone computed and justified; named Harvest Control Rule with parameters and version; Fisheries Act Fish Stocks check (below-LRP flag) and, if true, link to Rebuilding Plan. belowLRP = true requires a valid Rebuilding Plan link or shows Missing-Critical.\nA4. Change Log: Advice Trace Pack must include structured deltas vs. previous FSAR: data, methods, benchmarks, status, advice, rationale. Lead Author can export a Change Summary page between cycles.\nA5. CU Accounting: CU list for the SMU must explicitly list included, excluded, and proxied CUs with machine-readable justification; GSI usage (Yes/No), sample sizes, and assignment uncertainty. Any CU ≠ “included” requires justification + reviewer sign-off or it fails validation (flagged Missing-Critical).\nA6. Intake & Validation: Controlled‑vocab fields are enforced via SKOS; SHACL + R validator must pass all critical checks before a submission becomes “Ready”. Validation returns structured errors (severity, row/col, code, fix‑hint). Submission lifecycle is Draft → Validated → Ready → Ingested, with audit events and human approval before ingestion. Authors resolve all Critical errors locally; validator returns 0 Critical before upload is permitted.\nA7. GSI Risk Assessment: If stock is mixed-fishery AND gsiUsed = false → show risk chip (“No GSI apportionment”) and require rationale. GSI usage fields must include gsiUsed (bool), gsiSampleSize (int), gsiAssignmentUncertainty (text/CI or % misID), baseline_reference.\nA8. Executive KPIs: Exec sees coverage and completeness at a glance; Reviewer filters by risk type to accelerate audits. Exec sees a red “Policy trigger” chip whenever an SMU is below LRP and a Rebuilding Plan link is present.\nA9. Lead Author Workflow: Lead Author can generate a “submission-ready” trace pack with benchmarks, uncertainty notes, proxy decisions, and methods provenance in ≤2 clicks.\nA10. Reviewer Verification: Reviewer can verify benchmark method & code version; GSI sample size & uncertainty are visible where relevant. From any status tile, user can open drawer and reach all evidence links ≤2 clicks.\n\n\n\n\nContext: SPSR is a layered monolith today (Presentation → Application → Domain → Infrastructure). The architecture has evolved to use a Graph Knowledge Service microservice pattern instead of a simple sidecar.\n\n\nComponents: 1.

Keep the JSON‑LD contract so the UI remains decoupled and you can still export/share.

Always shows provenance minimum (source, method, code commit, reviewer/date) at the top.\n\nData tab: Input datasets, data sources, coverage windows, units/scales, QC status\nMethods tab: Method registry terms, versions, parameters, code commits/DOIs, reproducibility links\nBenchmarks tab: LRP/USR/TR entities with derivation evidence, uncertainty methods, regeneration queries\nUncertainty tab: Status intervals, GSI sample sizes, assignment uncertainty, downgrade criteria\nPolicy/Legal tab: WSP zone mapping, HCR parameters, Fisheries Act triggers, rebuilding plan links\nChanges tab: Delta vs. last FSAR (data, methods, benchmarks, status, advice, rationale)\nDocuments tab: Lists linked artifacts with icon, title, doc number, year, size; actions: Open, Download, Copy citation.\n\nTop ribbon: Readiness pill (Ready / Partial / Blocked) + “Why not Ready?” popover with specific missing items\nAlways show: Last FSAR vs This Cycle mini-diff\nExport button: Packages the Advice Trace Pack (versioned JSON-LD bundle with structured deltas vs. previous FSAR, figures, summary pdf of advice trace node metadata). Includes a /docs/ subfolder with cached PDFs if allowed and an optional /data/ folder if toggled.\n\nThis will be an interactive hierarchical tree style graph with progressive disclosure. The initial view shows all CUs for the selected SMU flowing to the SMU and then to Advice, with Management Decision and Legal Framework appearing as sub-nodes when Advice is expanded. Clicking any node reveals additional nodes and specific details in the Evidence Drawer. We need rich relationships (e.g., multiple datasets feeding multiple methods) and should use a node‑link view with a toggle for specific profiles for Biologist/Scientist, Data Steward/Custodian, and Executive/Director which shows different levels of details depending on their persona. Use Cytoscape.js or D3 or other custom javascript as needed.\n\n\n\n\nEvidence badges: Summarize evidence presence/quality for the decision context at each node:\nComplete = all required evidence present; Gaps = optional elements missing; Missing‑Critical = required evidence missing. These roll up SHACL/validator results and CQ checks. (Does not imply review approval.)\nRisk chips: Compact flags tied to specific CQs (e.g., proxy justification missing, no status CI). Clicking a chip focuses the Drawer on the missing field(s).\nEvidence Drawer: The audit lens—shows the who/what/when/how for the selected node: datasets, parameters, reference‑point derivations, code commit, reviewer/date, and links to figures or repos.\nDocuments: Surface authoritative downloads (FSAR, Technical Reports, Research Documents). Each item shows doc type, title, doc number/identifier, issued date, version, size, and a canonical URL/DOI; if internal, use a pre‑signed URL. A small badge indicates Public or Internal.\nCurrency tab: Shows last‑updated and version pins per component; highlights stale items with thresholds (e.g., &gt;12 months).\nDrill‑down: From Drawer items (e.g., a dataset row, code commit, or document), jump to the source in SPSR (record view), GRD (run/sample), CSAS/DFO publications page, or GitHub (exact commit/tag) or Zenodo Release. Breadcrumbs let you pop back to the node.\n\n\n\n\n\nHeader (Intake mode): “Start New Submission” with SMU + Year selectors.\nStep 1 — Metadata form: Controlled‑vocab dropdowns for spawner_origin, data_source_type, reference_point_type, downgrade_criterion (SKOS in graph:vocab); provenance minimum fields pinned.\nStep 2 — Attach files: Upload .xlsx (current accepted format). Parse Metadata tab first; show a preview of parsed metadata fields.\nStep 3 — Validate: Run SHACL + R validator; render inline errors (severity, row/col, code, fix‑hint). Provide “Re‑run validation” and “Download error report”.\nStep 4 — Ready & Submit: When no critical errors remain, mark Ready. Submissions require human review/approval before ingest to SPSR.\nUtilities: “Download tailored template” endpoint pre‑seeds enumerations and column headers by scope (Population, CU, SMU, Indicator Stock, PFMA); “Save draft” persists current progress."

(Investigate DFO CSAS terminology)\nDecision Support: Is DecisionContext the right term, or would Decision be sufficient for management decision support?\nSIL/SEN Integration: How should we align with Minh Doan’s PR for Stream Inspection Logs (SIL) and Escapement Narratives (SEN) terms?\n\nRelations (PROV‑O flavored): StatusAssessment used DataProduct/ReferencePoint, StatusAssessment wasGeneratedBy Method, ScientificOutput wasDerivedFrom StatusAssessment, ScientificOutput supports Decision, Figure wasDerivedFrom {DataProduct,Method}.\nWSP Rapid-Status Support:\nThe ontology now supports WSP rapid-status assessments via fsar:WSPMetric, fsar:MetricBenchmark, and fsar:AlgorithmThreshold classes. The dfo:StockAssessment class links to WSP metrics via fsar:assessesMetric, and produces rapid statuses via fsar:producesRapidStatus with confidence categories via fsar:hasConfidence. Decision requirement patterns from v3 (e.g., fsar:RebuildingPlanRequirement) work with WSP trigger conditions linking metric positions to policy obligations.\n\n\n\n\nThe FSAR Tracer now supports WSP rapid-status assessments through integration with the Learning Tree 3 decision-tree algorithm. This support enables tracking of the four standard WSP metrics, their benchmarks and algorithm thresholds, rapid status assignments, and confidence categories.\nFour Standard WSP Metrics:\n\nAbsolute Abundance: Compares generational average spawner abundance to COSEWIC criterion D1 thresholds. Lower benchmark: 1,000 spawners; Upper benchmark: 10,000 spawners.\nRelative Abundance: Compares generational average spawner abundance to CU-specific benchmarks (typically Sgen lower, 80% SMSY upper, or habitat capacity-based).\nLong-Term Trend: Compares current generational average to long-term average spawner abundance. Lower benchmark: 50% of long-term average; Upper benchmark: 75% of long-term average.\nPercent Change: Quantifies linear change in spawner abundance over the most recent three generations. Lower benchmark: -25%; Upper benchmark: -15%.\n\nLearning Tree 3 Decision-Tree Integration:\nThe Learning Tree 3 algorithm assigns rapid statuses (Red, Amber, Green) based on metric values and availability. The algorithm uses threshold values that differ from metric benchmarks by design, incorporating buffers and precautionary adjustments based on expert processes and CART analyses.\nMetric Benchmarks vs. Algorithm Thresholds:\nAlgorithm thresholds intentionally diverge from benchmarks in several places:\n\nAbsolute Abundance: Benchmark lower threshold is 1,000 spawners (COSEWIC criterion D1), but Learning Tree 3 algorithm uses 1,500 (benchmark plus 500 buffer) to account for uncertainty and how experts treated individual years in generational averages.\nRelative Abundance: Upper benchmark threshold in Learning Tree 3 equals the WSP upper benchmark plus 10% buffer to account for how this metric was treated in WSP integrated status processes.\nLong-Term Trend: Benchmark thresholds are 50% (lower) and 75% (upper), but Learning Tree 3 uses 79% (lower) and 233% (upper). These thresholds emerged from CART analyses and are applied conditionally with other metrics.\nPercent Change: Benchmark lower threshold is -25%, but Learning Tree 3 uses -70% (emerged from CART analyses). This threshold is only applied conditionally when long-term trend &gt;= 79% and absolute abundance &gt;= 10,000.\n\nConfidence Category Output:\nEach rapid status assessment includes a confidence category (High, Medium, or Low):\n\nHigh confidence: Status assigned using absolute abundance or relative abundance metrics (both requiring higher quality data and benchmarks).\nMedium confidence: Status based on long-term trend metrics with some abundance information available.\nLow confidence: Status based on trend metrics alone without abundance benchmarks.\n\nThese confidence ratings are derived from the algorithm branch (node) that determines the status, based on metric availability and data types used.\nDecision Requirements:\nWSP metric positions trigger decision requirements through fsar:Condition patterns that link to fsar:DecisionRequirement classes. For example, when rapid status is Red (below LRP), this triggers rebuilding plan requirements mandated by the Fisheries Act Fish Stocks Provisions."

    "text": "A1. Benchmarks: Each SMU year must include at least one LRP and one USR entity with derivation metadata (method, inputs, time window), version/DOI or commit, and an executable regeneration link (stored query or code pointer). Benchmarks must display type, value, method, sensitivity flags, and link to method/code provenance.\nA2. Uncertainty: Status decision must include interval or categorical uncertainty; where estimates are downgraded, the downgrade criterion (from SKOS scheme) is recorded and shown. Key estimates must include CI or flagged rationale for absence; status shows P(Green/Amber/Red) or a CI note.\nA3. Policy & Legal Readiness: “Ready” requires: WSP zone computed and justified; named Harvest Control Rule with parameters and version; Fisheries Act Fish Stocks check (below-LRP flag) and, if true, link to Rebuilding Plan. belowLRP = true requires a valid Rebuilding Plan link or shows Missing-Critical.\nA4. Change Log: Advice Trace Pack must include structured deltas vs. previous FSAR: data, methods, benchmarks, status, advice, rationale. Lead Author can export a Change Summary page between cycles.\nA5. CU Accounting: CU list for the SMU must explicitly list included, excluded, and proxied CUs with machine-readable justification; GSI usage (Yes/No), sample sizes, and assignment uncertainty. Any CU ≠ “included” requires justification + reviewer sign-off or it fails validation (flagged Missing-Critical).\nA6. Intake & Validation: Controlled‑vocab fields are enforced via SKOS; SHACL + R validator must pass all critical checks before a submission becomes “Ready”. Validation returns structured errors (severity, row/col, code, fix‑hint). Submission lifecycle is Draft → Validated → Ready → Ingested, with audit events and human approval before ingestion. Authors resolve all Critical errors locally; validator returns 0 Critical before upload is permitted.\nA7. GSI Risk Assessment: If stock is mixed-fishery AND gsiUsed = false → show risk chip (“No GSI apportionment”) and require rationale. GSI usage fields must include gsiUsed (bool), gsiSampleSize (int), gsiAssignmentUncertainty (text/CI or % misID), baseline_reference.\nA8. Executive KPIs: Exec sees coverage and completeness at a glance; Reviewer filters by risk type to accelerate audits. Exec sees a red “Policy trigger” chip whenever an SMU is below LRP and a Rebuilding Plan link is present.\nA9. Lead Author Workflow: Lead Author can generate a “submission-ready” trace pack with benchmarks, uncertainty notes, proxy decisions, and methods provenance in ≤2 clicks.\nA10. Reviewer Verification: Reviewer can verify benchmark method & code version; GSI sample size & uncertainty are visible where relevant. From any status tile, user can open drawer and reach all evidence links ≤2 clicks."

HTMX keeps the experience snappy.\nDocuments: accessible via Advice node expansion, showing FSAR/Research/Tech Report quick links and full document hierarchy.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf/when SPSR evolves toward services, the JSON‑LD contract and SPARQL adapter remain valid; you can swap the graph engine (e.g., Blazegraph, Neptune) without changing UI.\nThe anti‑corruption layer keeps ontology terms from leaking into core domain models; rollouts are safer."

It will usher in a significant new approach to the conservation of one of Canada’s most valuable and cherished resources – wild Pacific salmon. Its adoption represents Fisheries and Oceans Canada’s commitment to maintain healthy and diverse populations of salmon that will support sustainable fisheries now, and meet the needs of future generations.\nThis new approach specifies clear objectives, establishes strategies to meet them, and presents a decision-making process to ensure that choices made about salmon conservation reflect societal values. The policy places conservation of salmon and their habitats as the first priority for resource management.\nIt gives tangible effect to this principle by committing to safeguard the genetic diversity of wild salmon, and maintain habitat and ecosystem integrity. The policy also considers the values that the harvesting of Pacific salmon provide to people. It reflects a management framework that will provide care and respect for the resource and its ecosystem, and for the people who rely on it for food and spiritual needs, for recreation, and for their livelihood.\nI would like to thank the hundreds of dedicated Canadians who participated in our consultations and contributed to the completion of this policy. Their expertise, their dedication, and their passionate advocacy for the well-being of this precious resource have been of immeasurable value and have helped us to improve the policy as it was being developed.\nWhile the adoption of this policy is a significant step, the work to secure the future of Pacific salmon is just beginning. My Department is fully committed to its implementation, but we know that full success in meeting its objectives will depend upon cooperation among all who have an interest in wild Pacific salmon. I am confident that with the sustained efforts of First Nations, fishers, environmental groups, and members of the public, we will together be able to make real and lasting change.\nI look forward to working with all groups to implement this policy and secure a brighter future for salmon.\nThe Honourable Geoff Regan P.C. M.P. Minister of Fisheries and Oceans\nMay 31, 2005\n\fvi\nWild Salmon Policy\nThe Wild Salmon Policy – A Snapshot\nThe goal of the Wild Salmon Policy is to restore and maintain healthy and diverse salmon populations and their habitats for the benefit and enjoyment of the people of Canada in perpetuity.\nThis policy goal will be advanced by safeguarding the genetic diversity of wild salmon populations, maintaining habitat and ecosystem integrity, and managing fisheries for sustainable benefits.\nConservation of wild salmon and their habitat is the highest priority for resource management decision-making.\nResource management processes and decisions will honour Canada’s obligations to First Nations.\nImplementation of this policy will involve an open and inclusive process aimed at making decisions about salmon stewardship that consider social, economic, and biological consequences. People throughout British Columbia and the Yukon will contribute to decisions that reflect society’s values for wild salmon.\nWild salmon will be maintained by identifying and managing “Conservation Units” (CUs) that reflect their geographic and genetic diversity. A CU is a group of wild salmon sufficiently isolated from other groups that, if lost, is very unlikely to recolonize naturally within an acceptable timeframe (e.g., a human lifetime or a specified number of salmon generations).\nThe status of CUs will be monitored, assessed against selected benchmarks, and reported publicly. Where monitoring indicates low levels of abundance, or deterioration in the distribution of the spawning components of a CU, a full range of management actions to reverse declines – including habitat, enhancement, and harvest measures – will be considered and an appropriate response implemented.\nMeasures for habitat protection and salmon enhancement will focus on sustaining wild salmon. An integrated approach to habitat management – involving assessment of habitat condition, identification of indicators and benchmarks, and monitoring of status – will be adopted that links fish production with watershed and coastal planning and stewardship initiatives.\nEcosystem considerations will be incorporated into salmon management. Indicators will be developed to assess the status of freshwater ecosystems. Information from ocean climate studies of marine survival and of the biological condition of salmon will be integrated into the annual assessments of salmon abundance that guide salmon harvest planning.\nThe policy aims to maintain CUs but recognizes there will be exceptional circumstances where it is not feasible or reasonable to fully address all risks. Where an assessment concludes that conservation measures will be ineffective or the social or economic costs to rebuild a CU are extreme, the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans may decide to limit the range of measures taken. Such a decision will be made openly and transparently.\nThis policy will foster a healthy, diverse, and abundant salmon resource for future generations of Canadians. It will support sustainable fisheries to meet the needs of First Nations and contribute to the current and future prosperity of Canadians.\n\fWild Salmon Policy\n1\nWhat are Wild Pacific Salmon?\nThe Wild Salmon Policy (WSP) addresses five species of Pacific salmon found in British Columbia and the Yukon2 Oncorhynchus nerka (sockeye), O. kisutch (coho), O. tshawytscha (chinook), O. gorbuscha (pink), and O. keta (chum).These species form part of the larger classification of Pacific salmonids, which include steelhead and cutthroat trout. DFO has authority under the federal Fisheries Act to manage Pacific salmon and their habitat.The management of steelhead and cutthroat trout has been delegated to the Province of British Columbia, though responsibility for protection of their habitat remains with the Department.The Department will co- operate with BC in the management and enhancement of these species, consistent with the WSP.\nSalmon are considered “wild” if they have spent their entire life cycle in the wild and originate from parents that were also produced by natural spawning and continuously lived in the wild.\nSalmon that originate directly\nfrom hatcheries and managed spawning channels are not considered wild in this policy, and are called “enhanced” salmon.\nThis term is sometimes also applied to salmon that originate from other enhancement activities, such as habitat restoration and lake enrichment, since their rate of production has been augmented. However, the reproduction of these fish has not been altered, and therefore they are deemed “wild” in this policy.\nThe requirement in the definition\nthat a wild salmon must complete more than one full generation in the wild safeguards against potential adverse effects resulting from artificial culture.\n2Wild Pacific salmon in the Northwest Territories are relatively uncommon, not actively managed, and are not included in this policy.\nI N T R O D U C T I O N\nCanadians on the West Coast have an enduring connection with Pacific salmon forged thousands of years ago with the arrival of the first peoples. Wild salmon serve as a vital source of food for First Nations and have a central place in their culture and spirituality; they provide jobs, income, and enjoyment for individuals, businesses, and coastal communities; and they play a key role in natural ecosystems, nourishing a complex web of interconnected species. The ties of Pacific salmon with west coast communities, people, and ecology have been eloquently described in the writings of the late Roderick Haig-Brown, who observed:\nThe salmon runs are a visible symbol of life, death and regeneration, plain for all to see and share … The salmon are a test of a healthy environment, a lesson in environmental needs. Their abundant presence on the spawning beds is a lesson of hope, of deep importance for the future of man.1\nDuring the past decade, the management of Pacific salmon has become progressively more challenging for various reasons. Supreme Court decisions, varying ocean productivity, conservation concerns, habitat loss, international agreements, new Canadian legislation governing species at risk, shifts in global markets, and altered public expectations have all contributed to this dynamic operating context. The Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) has adapted to changing circumstances but policy and programs must continue to be reshaped to address contemporary challenges and secure a healthy future for Canada’s Pacific salmon. This document provides a blueprint for meeting these challenges – it presents Canada’s policy for conservation of wild Pacific salmon.\n1 Haig-Brown (1974), The Salmon.\n\f2\nWild Salmon Policy\nL E G A L CO N T E X T F O R T H E W I L D S A L M O N P O L I C Y ( W S P )\nSpecifically, DFO is committed to managing fisheries such that Aboriginal fishing for food, social and ceremonial purposes has priority over other fisheries.\nthe\nretains\nauthority\nSection 91 of the Constitution Act, 1867 assigns exclusive legislative authority over “Sea Coast and Inland Fisheries” to the federal government. The Minister of Fisheries and Oceans exercises this authority under the Fisheries Act and regulations. The Minister and accountability for the protection and sustainable use of fisheries resources and their habitat. The Minister’s authority includes the discretion and powers necessary to regulate access to the resource, impose conditions on harvesting, and enforce regulations. Provincial, Territorial and municipal governments have important authorities with respect to land, water and waste disposal that need to complement efforts to conserve fish and fish habitat.\nThe legal context for management of wild salmon is also defined by court decisions respecting Aboriginal and treaty rights. Existing Aboriginal and treaty rights are recognized and affirmed in section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982. In its 1990 decision in R. v. Sparrow, the Supreme Court of Canada held that the recognition and affirmation of existing Aboriginal rights in the Constitution Act, 1982 means that any infringement of such rights must be justified. As described in more detail in Appendix 1, DFO seeks to manage fisheries in a manner consistent with the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Sparrow and subsequent court decisions such as the decision of the BC Court of Appeal in R. v. Jack, John and John.\nIn its 2004 decision in Haida v. BC, the Supreme Court of Canada concluded that the Crown has a legal duty to consult with Aboriginal groups and, depending on the strength of the claim of Aboriginal rights or Aboriginal title and the seriousness of the potential adverse effect of a decision on title, accommodate their interests when the Crown has knowledge of the potential existence of an Aboriginal right or Aboriginal title and is making decisions that might adversely affect the Aboriginal right or Aboriginal title. The Court also concluded that the scope of the duty will vary depending on the circumstances.\nthe claimed\nrights or\nThe WSP will be implemented in accordance with the guidance provided by the courts with respect to governments’ obligations to First Nations, including the guidance provided by the Supreme Court of Canada in Haida v. BC, and any guidance from courts in future. The WSP will also be implemented in accordance with the Nisga’a Final Agreement, the Yukon Final Agreements, and any other treaties or agreements entered into between the federal government and First Nations.\nPAC I F I C S A L M O N A N D D I V E R S I T Y\nThe health of Pacific salmon depends not only on their abundance but also on their biological diversity. That diversity includes the irreplaceable lineages of salmon evolved through time, the geographic distribution of these populations, the genetic differences and life history variations observed among them, and the habitats that support these differences. Diversity of Pacific salmon represents their legacy to-date and their potential for adaptation to future changes in climate, fishing, and habitat. Protecting diversity is the most prudent policy for the future continuance of wild salmon as well as the ecological processes that depend on them and the cultural, social, and economic benefits drawn from them.\n\fWild Salmon Policy\n3\nConcern for diversity in Pacific salmon emerged as a significant issue during the 1990s, along with Canada’s support for the 1992 UN Convention on Biological Diversity. By 1990 in southwestern BC, one-third of the spawning locations (a species in a stream) known since the 1950s had been lost or diminished to such low numbers that spawners were not consistently monitored at these sites.3 This portion of BC is however the centre of urbanization and development and is not representative of the province as a whole. In 1996, a study for the American Fisheries Society identified 8,171 natural spawning locations throughout BC and the Yukon.4 The study reported that salmon had been extirpated in 2 per cent of these locations and had a high chance of extinction in another 12 per cent, based on the current numbers of spawners and/or the rate of change in those numbers. These declines in diversity are one impetus for a new management approach for wild salmon.\nT H E I M P O RTA N C E O F H A B I TAT A N D E CO S Y S T E M S\nTo survive and prosper, wild salmon need appropriate freshwater and marine habitat: no habitat, no salmon. Productive habitat in the Pacific Region faces growing pressures from human activities that threaten the capacity to sustain salmon populations over the long term. The land and water that comprise habitat important for salmon productivity also have significant economic value to non-fishery uses, such as urban development, forestry, agriculture, and other industries. These competing uses may compromise the value of the habitat for salmon and associated species. An ongoing concern is that habitat productivity can deteriorate as the result of many small, incremental and often unidentified impacts accumulating over time. In addition, ocean and\nfreshwater habitat can be affected by global-scale phenomena, such as climate change.\nThe roles that Pacific salmon play in marine (oceanic, coastal, and estuarine), freshwater (lake, stream, and wetland), and terrestrial ecosystems (adjacent to streams and rivers, the riparian zone) have also become a significant issue in salmon management. The acceptance of the influence of marine ecosystems on salmon survival and production has undoubtedly been one of the major advances in recent knowledge about Pacific salmonids. This policy includes actions to progressively account for ecosystem values in salmon management.\nHabitat pressures will continue to grow as human populations increase and, with them, demands for space, food, and livelihood. The challenge for habitat managers is to regulate social and economic activities to avoid or mitigate adverse impacts on fish habitat, in cooperation with First Nations, Provincial, Territorial, and local governments. The new management approach needs to meet this challenge more effectively and maintain habitat and ecosystem integrity for the long-term health of Pacific salmon populations.\n3Riddell (1993), “Spatial organization of Pacific salmon: What to conserve?”\n4Slaney et al. (1996), “Status of anadromous salmon and trout in British Columbia and the Yukon.” The numbers reported here exclude steelhead, which are not covered by this policy. The paper assessed trends in 4,906 combinations of species within streams (i.e., a stream with three species spawning would account for three spawning locations). The 4,906 spawning locations were 60 per cent of the total number of known locations, but the remaining 40 per cent did not have adequate data to support an assessment.\n\f4\nWild Salmon Policy\nS A L M O N D I V E R S I T Y A N D B I O D I V E R S I T Y\nThe diversity in Pacific salmon described above refers to genetic variation and adaptations to different environments that have accumulated between populations of salmon. The abundance of spawning salmon is understood to be important for the future production of salmon, and it is also critical for the maintenance of genetic variation or diversity within populations, and for connectedness of populations that results from straying. A low level of straying between spawning groups provides an important source of genetic variation and allows for colonization of new habitats. In this policy, the term diversity, or salmon diversity, refers to genetic variation and adaptations within and between populations of wild Pacific salmon.\nPacific salmon are, however, part of a larger ecosystem and are components of the total biological diversity in these natural systems. In this policy, biodiversity (or biological diversity) is defined as the full range of variety and variability within and among living organisms and the ecological complexes in which they occur; and encompasses diversity at the ecosystem, community, species, and genetic levels and the interaction of\nthese components.5 The protection of biodiversity, and understanding the broader implications of this term, is also essential to implementation and success of this policy. The biodiversity associated with Pacific salmon populations will influence the quality and productivity of the salmon’s ecosystems and local habitats, and determines the biological background influencing salmon diversity and their adaptability.\nCanada’s Species at Risk Act (SARA) recognizes the importance of the diversity within species by defining ‘‘wildlife species’’ to mean “a species, subspecies, variety or geographically or genetically distinct population of animal, plant or other organism, other than a bacterium or virus, that is wild by nature and (a) is native to Canada; or (b) has extended its range into Canada without human intervention and has been present in Canada for at least 50 years”.6 This policy defines the geographic or genetically distinct populations of salmon and the habitats necessary to protect their biodiversity. These groupings of salmon fit the definition of “wildlife species” in SARA.\nTHE WILD SALMON POLICY – A NEW MANAGEMENT APPROACH\nWithin the last decade, various measures have been implemented to advance the conservation of Pacific salmon. For example, the commercial fishing fleet was reduced, Canada and the United States renewed the Pacific Salmon Treaty, and selective harvesting practices have been developed and adopted. There is now a greater recognition of the role of wild salmon in Pacific Northwest ecosystems. Each of these actions, in turn, has contributed to the growth of a more informed conservation ethic for Pacific salmon, one that recognizes the inherent value of salmon, the importance of diversity among and within populations, and the obvious and enduring cultural, social, and economic benefits.\n51992 UN Convention on Biological Diversity, and Noss (1990), “Indicators for monitoring biodiversity.” 6SARA, subsection 2.1., available at www.sararegistry.gc.ca/the_act/default_e.cfm.\n\fWild Salmon Policy\n5\nAlthough progress has been made in salmon conservation, there are continuing challenges for some wild populations, their ecosystems, and the people that rely on them. For example, three distinct groups – Interior Fraser River coho, Cultus Lake sockeye in the Lower Fraser, and Sakinaw Lake sockeye in the Strait of Georgia – were designated as Endangered by COSEWIC. There has been an increasing awareness that past management of large fisheries and “stocks” has failed to adequately protect or recognize the value of diversity in Pacific salmon. A new approach to managing salmon production and diversity is needed to conserve salmon and protect and restore the full array of benefits they provide to Canadians. The impetus for a new management approach also comes from the evolution in public attitudes, science, laws and decision-making over the past twenty years. Thousands of volunteer streamkeepers and many local watershed groups now actively protect and restore Pacific salmon and habitat. Biologists are learning more about the genetic diversity of wild salmon, the impact of climate on survival, and the relationship of salmon to their habitat and surrounding ecosystems. The Species at Risk Act mandates the protection of geographically or genetically distinct populations with a high probability of extinction, while the Oceans Act calls for integrated resource management and an ecosystem perspective. First Nations governments and non-governmental organizations are demanding more involvement in decisions about wild salmon.\nExpectations for the management of Pacific salmon today require a more proactive, forward- looking approach that sets clear conservation goals and acknowledges the importance of protecting biodiversity for sustaining diverse healthy wild salmon populations, their habitats, and associated benefits. Together with the enjoyment wild salmon provide, their place in our cultural identity, and the expectations of Canadians responsible stewardship, these factors make a compelling case\nfor\nfor a new policy approach. The Wild Salmon Policy takes account of consultations with First Nations, user groups, and the general public on draft discussion papers released in 2000, 2004, and early 2005.7\nThe policy that follows will guide future decisions to conserve wild salmon and their habitat in BC and the Yukon. It neither amends nor overrides existing legislation or regulations, but will serve as the blueprint that will govern how these statutory authorities will be implemented.\nThis policy will facilitate an adaptive approach to salmon conservation in BC and the Yukon. By choice, decision-making is achieved through an inclusive process, rather than through the establishment of a set of predetermined rules. The policy defines objectives and describes conservation outcomes, but it does not prescribe decision rules that would restrict its application. This approach is well-suited to dealing with the circumstances that pertain to salmon. Choices about conservation will be made openly, with input\n7DFO (2000), The Wild Salmon Policy Discussion Paper; Dovetail Consulting Inc. et al (2000), Final Report on Consultations for the Wild Salmon Policy Discussion Paper and the Salmonid Enhancement Program: Analysis of Input from Provincial Stakeholder Group Meetings, Community Forums, Response Forms and Submissions; and DFO (2004a), A Policy Framework for Conservation of Wild Pacific Salmon (Draft).\n\f6\nWild Salmon Policy\nfrom First Nations, and local and region wide stakeholder groups, to ensure that decisions reflect societal values. Management of wild salmon and their habitat is complex, and the problems encountered are diverse. It is not feasible to design rules that anticipate and adequately address all eventualities that will be encountered. A deterministic approach is inflexible, can eliminate the exercise of judgement, and may result in the wrong solution, or impose significant unnecessary costs. The approach adopted in this policy avoids these problems, and offers increased opportunities for the consideration of alternatives, such as habitat initiatives, to assist in addressing protection and rebuilding of salmon. Finally, the approach selected is compatible with the Fisheries Act, and consistent with the principle of Ministerial discretion.\n\fWild Salmon Policy\n7\nP O L I C Y F O R T H E CO N S E RVAT I O N O F W I L D PAC I F I C S A L M O N\nThis policy describes how DFO will meet its responsibilities for the conservation of wild Pacific salmon. It stipulates an overall policy goal for wild salmon, identifies basic principles to guide resource management decision-making, and sets out objectives and strategies to achieve the goal (Figure 1).\nThe successful implementation of this policy will provide Canadians\nwith:\n• Healthy, diverse, and abundant wild salmon populations for future\ngenerations;\n• Sustainable fisheries to meet the needs of First Nations and contribute to the current and future prosperity of all Canadians; and\n• Improved accounting for ecosystem values in salmon and habitat\nmanagement decisions.\n\f8\nWild Salmon Policy\nImportant Terminology: Conservation and Sustainable Use\nThe intent of this policy is to provide a framework for the conservation and sustainable use of wild Pacific salmon. These terms – “Conservation” and “Sustainable Use” mean different things to different people. Some definitions of conservation include sustainable use, implying that protection of the biological processes and use of resources are both components of conservation. Other definitions, such as in the Convention on Biological Diversity, separate the two concepts, and present them as related, but distinct considerations. In this policy,these terms are differentiated. Conservation is the protection, maintenance, and rehabilitation of genetic diversity, species, and ecosystems to sustain biodiversity and the continuance of evolutionary and natural production processes.8\nThis definition identifies the primacy of conservation over use, and separates issues associated with constraints on use from allocation and priority amongst users.\nSustainable Use is the use of biological resources in a way and at a rate that does not lead to their long term decline, thereby maintaining the potential for future generations to meet their needs and aspirations.\nAs a resource management agency, DFO is committed to the sustainable use of wild salmon resources.The intent of this policy is to protect the biological foundation of wild Pacific salmon to provide the fullest benefits presently and for future generations. In the long term, protection of biodiversity will provide the greatest opportunity for maintaining sustainable benefits to Canadians.\n8See Shuter et al. (1997),“Reply:Toward a definition of conservation principles for fisheries management;” Grumbine (1994), “What is ecosystem management?” Mangel et al. (1996),“Conservation of wild living resources;” and Olver et al. (1995), “Toward a definition of conservation principles for fisheries management.”\nFigure 1 Overview of the Wild Pacific Salmon Policy\nG OA L\nRestore and maintain healthy and diverse salmon populations and their habitats for the benefit and enjoyment of the people of Canada in perpetuity\nO B J E C T I V E S\nSafeguard the genetic diversity of wild Pacific salmon\nMaintain habitat and ecosystem integrity\nManage fisheries for sustainable benefits\nS T R AT E G I E S\nStandardized monitoring of wild salmon status Assessment of habitat status Inclusion of ecosystem values and monitoring Integrated strategic planning\nAnnual program delivery Performance review\nG U I D I N G P R I N C I P L E S\nConservation of wild salmon and their habitats is the highest priority\nHonour obligations to First Nations\nSustainable use\nOpen and transparent decision-making\nG OA L A N D G U I D I N G P R I N C I P L E S\nThe goal of the Wild Salmon Policy is to restore and maintain healthy and diverse salmon populations and their habitats for the benefit and enjoyment of the people of Canada in perpetuity.\nAll decisions and activities pertaining to the conservation of wild\nPacific salmon will be guided by four principles:\nPrinciple 1 Conservation. Conservation of wild Pacific salmon and their habitats is the highest priority in resource management decision-making.\nThe protection and restoration of wild Pacific salmon and their habitats will enable the long-term health and productivity of wild populations and continued provision of cultural, social and economic benefits. To safeguard the long-term viability of wild Pacific salmon in natural surroundings, the Department will strive to maintain healthy populations in diverse habitats.\nPrinciple 2 Honour obligations to First Nations. Resource management processes and decisions will honour Canada’s obligations to First Nations.\nThis includes Canada’s legal duty to consult with First Nations and, depending on the strength of the claim of Aboriginal rights or Aboriginal title and the seriousness of the potential adverse effect of a decision on the\n(cid:228) (cid:228) \fclaimed rights or title, accommodate their interests when Canada has knowledge of the potential existence of an Aboriginal right or Aboriginal title and is making decisions that might adversely affect the right or title. Resource management processes and decisions will also be in accordance with the Nisga’a Final Agreement, the Yukon Final Agreements, and any other treaties or agreements entered into between Canada and First Nations.\nPrinciple 3 Sustainable Use. Resource management decisions will consider biological, social, and economic consequences, reflect best including Aboriginal Traditional Knowledge (ATK), and maintain the potential for future generations to meet their needs and aspirations.9\nscience\nSocial, economic, and biological considerations will inform decisions on salmon, their habitats, and their ecosystems consistent with the priorities assigned to Principles 1 and 2. Conservation decisions cannot be based solely on biological information. The maintenance of biodiversity and healthy ecosystems must be considered in the context of human needs for use now and in the future. Decisions will not be taken without regard to their cost or social consequences.\nPrinciple 4 Open Process. Resource management decisions will be made in an open, transparent and inclusive manner.\nTo gain broad public support for decision-making, salmon management must accommodate a wide range of interests in the resource. Decisions about salmon protection and sustainable use will be based on meaningful public input to ensure they reflect society’s values. Decision-making processes will be transparent and governed by clear and consistent rules and procedures.\nWild Salmon Policy\n9\nO B J E C T I V E S\nTo achieve the outcome expressed in the policy goal for wild salmon, three objectives must be fulfilled:\n\nSafeguard the genetic diversity of wild\n\nPacific salmon;\n\nMaintain habitat and ecosystem integrity;\n\nand\n\nManage fisheries for sustainable benefits.\n\nKey considerations associated with each of\nthese objectives are described below.\nObjective 1 Safeguard the genetic diversity of wild Pacific salmon To sustain Pacific salmon and their associated benefits, it is necessary to safeguard their geographic and genetic diversity and their habitats. While maintaining diversity is broadly accepted as essential for the health of wild salmon, the significant scientific and policy issue is how much diversity? The genetic diversity of a species includes\n9Brundtland (1987), Our Common Future: The World Commission on Environment and Development, and Environment Canada (1995), Canadian Biodiversity Strategy: Canada’s Response to the Convention on Biological Diversity.\n(cid:228) (cid:228) (cid:228) \f10 Wild Salmon Policy\nThe Population Structure of Wild Salmon\nSalmon have a complex hierarchical population structure extending from groups of salmon at individual spawning sites all the way up to taxonomic species.Their precise homing to natal streams and their death after spawning restrict gene flow among fish at different spawning locations. However, since some salmon stray, genetic exchange also occurs among fish from different persistent spawning sites (demes) in a geographic area.These interactions form a geographic network of demes and the basic level of genetic organization in Pacific salmon. The likelihood of genetic exchange decreases with increased distance between streams, or with greater physical differences between streams. Fewer strays and less genetic mixing result in less genetic similarity between fish in these streams. Eventually, as distance or environmental differences grow to severely limit gene flow, the spawning groups will function as separate lineages.These independently functioning aggregates are defined as Conservation Units in this policy.\nBetween localized demes and the geographic boundary of a CU are usually intermediate groupings called Populations. A population is a group of interbreeding salmon that is sufficiently isolated (i.e., reduced genetic exchange) from other populations such that persistent adaptations to the local habitat can develop over time. Local adaptations and genetic differences between populations are an essential part of the diversity needed for long-term viability of Pacific salmon.A CU will contain one or more populations (see Figure 2).\nevery individual fish. Preserving maximum genetic diversity would eliminate human harvesting of salmon and prohibit human activities that might harm salmon habitat. Conversely, to maintain a taxonomic species, such as sockeye salmon, but ignore within-species population structure would reduce diversity and contravene the intent of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, SARA and the intent of this policy.\nDFO intends to maintain diversity through the protection of “Conservation Units” (CUs). A CU is a group of wild salmon sufficiently isolated from other groups that, if extirpated is very unlikely to recolonize naturally within an acceptable timeframe, such as a human lifetime or a specified number of salmon generations.\nThere are important implications to this definition of a Conservation Unit. The persistence of salmon within the CU, and its associated production, demand responsible management of its population structure and habitats, as well as the ability of fish to move among habitat areas (connectivity). The loss of a CU for the length of a human lifetime would clearly have serious consequences for the people and other ecosystem components that benefit from or depend on it.\nOver the geographic area of a CU, variations in habitat type and quality may result in differences in salmon productivity. Such differences in nature mean that not all populations within a CU are likely to be maintained at equal levels of production or chance of loss. Maintaining CUs requires protecting populations and demes, but not necessarily all of them, all of the time. As long as networks of connected demes and streams within CUs are maintained, any loss of a localized spawning group should be temporary. Maintaining healthy abundances within CUs requires sufficient spawning salmon to recolonize depleted spawning areas and protection of fish habitat to support production and provide connection between localized spawning groups. While salmon from neighboring demes or populations are unlikely to be genetically identical to those lost, they are likely to be most similar genetically and share many adaptive traits. Such localized losses, whether due to natural events or human activities, would not result in extirpation of the CU.\nTotal success in safeguarding the genetic diversity of wild Pacific salmon would imply preserving all populations and CUs. Action Steps in the WSP are prescribed to maintain CUs to the fullest extent possible, but there will likely be circumstances when losses of wild salmon are unavoidable. Catastrophic events are beyond human control and the Department may not be able to restore habitat or spawning demes damaged by such events. The rate of climate change in an area may exceed the ability of some salmon populations to adjust. While it is the clear intent of this policy to prevent losses resulting from management and use, it is unrealistic in natural environments to expect all losses can be avoided.\n\fWild Salmon Policy\n11\nConservation Units and the Maintenance of Diversity\nDiversity in Pacific salmon reflects genetic and habitat diversity and the evolution of lineages of salmon over thousands of years10. These precise lineages cannot be replaced once lost, and the more numerous they are the greater the chances for salmon to adjust to future environmental changes. Diversity is a kind of insurance that reduces the risk of loss by increasing the likelihood that species and populations will be able to adapt to changing circumstances and survive. Furthermore, maintaining the largest number of spawning populations that are adapted to their individual habitats will result in higher abundances of salmon.\nBiologists still have much to learn about the importance of local adaptations at the stream\nlevel, the rate at which salmon adapt, and the value of biodiversity. However, since no one can foresee the future stresses on wild salmon, a responsible and precautionary approach recommends conserving a wide diversity of populations and habitats. Pacific salmon have been diverse and adaptable enough to survive floods and drought, disease, volcanic eruptions, and ice ages. Their survival strategies should continue to serve them in the future, unless human-caused pressures become insurmountable. We must ensure that these survival strategies are allowed to function and not destroyed by our growing human footprint.\nSome CUs will encompass large areas and include many streams and localized spawning\ngroups. Concerns have been expressed that for such large CUs, individual streams and spawning groups may not be adequately protected even if they are important to local communities. All local demes and streams have value. In practice, protecting entire CUs with their networks of spawning groups is the most effective way to protect individual spawning groups and the interests of local communities.\nThese networks provide the natural process for recolonizing streams and salmon habitat\n(with similar genetically related salmon) that may be lost through natural events or some human impact. For example, if attention is focused on a local stream and the overall well-being of the CU is not maintained, then the stream of interest may become isolated from other spawning groups, and at greater risk of loss, through habitat loss or reduced abundances in neighboring streams. The critical assumption underlying these processes, however, is the protection and maintenance of functioning habitat and ecosystems within the CU.\nThe desired number of spawners for a CU will be established to provide for an adequate abundance and distribution of salmon throughout its geographic range. The annual status of the CU in relation to these targets will guide the development of harvest management plans in the integrated planning process (Strategy 4).\n10For further reading on biodiversity and Pacific salmon, see for example: Greer and Harvey (2004), Blue Genes: Sharing and Conserving the World’s Aquatic Biodiversity; Gallaugher and Wood (2004), The World Summit on Salmon: Proceedings; Hilborn et al. (2003) “Biocomplexity and fisheries sustainability;” Harvey (2002), Biodiversity and Fisheries: A Primer for Planners; Wood (2002), Managing biodiversity in Pacific salmon: The evolution of the Skeena River sockeye salmon fishery in British Columbia; Harvey et al. (1998), Action before extinction: an international conference on conservation of fish genetic diversity; Wood and Holtby (1998), “Defining conservation units for Pacific salmon using genetic survey data;” and Levin and Schiewe (2001), “Preserving salmon biodiversity.”\n\f12 Wild Salmon Policy\nSpecies Differences in Conservation Units (see Figure 2)\nThe number and sizes of CUs will vary among species. For instance, pink and chum salmon generally show fewer genetic differences between populations and demes than the other species. Consequently, their CUs will be relatively large. Similarly, coho rarely exhibit marked genetic boundaries, so their CUs will tend to be large and at times somewhat difficult to define. Coho show, however, substantial life history variation (e.g., lake rearing juveniles, fry migrants, run timing variation) within a region. Chinook salmon also show varied life histories, but the differences tend to be more geographically aligned, and so will probably have more CUs than coho. Sockeye CUs are probably easiest to identify and will be the most numerous. Genetic information strongly suggests that sockeye CUs will typically be at the level of an individual sockeye-rearing lake. In some cases though, it may turn out that several small sockeye lakes will constitute one CU, or that different timing components (“runs”) within large lakes may represent separate CUs. The delineation of CUs in all species will be based on biological information including genetic variation, phenotypic traits (e.g., run timing, life history traits, ocean distribution, etc.), and aboriginal traditional knowledge (ATK) if available. Delineations of CUs are expected to change over time as more information and experience is gained.\nFigure 2 Schematic representation of genetic diversity and Conservation Unit structure\nTaxonomic Species\n\nnerka (sockeye)\nkisutch (coho)\ntshawytscha (chinook)\ngorbuscha (pink)\nketa (chum)\n\n~100 CUs in B.C. & Yukon of which 20–25 CUs are in Fraser of which Chilko Lake is one Fraser CU\n~15 CUs in B.C. & Yukon of which 2 CUs are in Fraser of which Interior Fraser is one Fraser CU\n~30 CUs in B.C. & Yukon of which ~6 CUs are in Fraser of which South Thompson is one Fraser CU\n~25 CUs in B.C. & Yukon of which 2–3 CUs are in Fraser of which lower Fr. odd year pinks are one Fraser CU\n~15 CUs in B.C. & Yukon of which Fraser chum is one CU\nChilko Lake is a population and a CU\n5 populations in interior Fraser CU\n2 populations in South Thompson CU\n~15 populations in lower Fraser odd year CU\n~8 populations in Fraser CU\n3 spawning locations in Chilko Lake CU\nSpawning sites in ~200 streams in interior Fraser CU\nSpawning sites in ~15 rivers in South Thompson CU\nSpawning sites in ~45 streams in lower Fraser odd year CU\nSpawning sites in ~115 streams in Fraser CU\nConservation Units\ny t i s r e v i D c i t e n e G\nPopulations\nDemes\nGeographic Range\nObjective 2 Maintain habitat and ecosystem integrity\nThe health and long-term well-being of wild Pacific salmon is inextricably linked to the availability of diverse and productive freshwater, coastal, and marine habitats. Moreover, Pacific salmon have a critical function in the aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems sustained by these habitats. Salmon play an important role in marine ecosystems, with their bodies and waste products providing nutrients for organisms from microbes to top predators, such as killer whales. In freshwater ecosystems, returning salmon transport marine-derived nutrients inland. Salmon carcasses sustain aquatic and terrestrial animals and provide nutrients to the entire ecosystem including subsequent generations of wild salmon.\nAquatic habitats and their adjacent terrestrial areas are also valued for a wide range of human requirements. The integrity of salmon habitat is challenged by human competition for accessible land and fresh water, for ocean spaces, and for the interconnecting estuarine and coastal areas. In both freshwater and marine areas, human activities affect water quality. In estuaries and the marine foreshore, development can affect wild salmon during critical rearing and migration periods. In the open ocean, activities such as commercial fishing, shipping, and waste disposal among others can potentially affect the marine habitat of salmon.\n(cid:228) \fWild Salmon Policy\n13\nLinking Habitat to Wild Salmon CUs and Fish Harvest Planning\nA key response of the regional Habitat Management Program to the WSP is an increased emphasis on integrated planning. Fish production and harvest objectives for wild salmon CUs will be linked to the conservation, restoration, and development of fish habitat.\nAt the resource planning level, better habitat protection priorities will be established by integrating habitat requirements with the fisheries resources they support and with fish management objectives. Habitat plans will incorporate knowledge of the current and future demands on the environment and the aquatic resources, and will be aligned with objectives for fisheries and watersheds for priority CUs.\nIdentifying, protecting, restoring and rehabilitating aquatic habitats are critical to maintaining their integrity and sustaining ecosystems. Since 1986, DFO’s Habitat Management Program has been guided by the “no net loss” principle for the protection of these habitats.11 The first and preferred approach is prevention of habitat loss. DFO policy also stipulates that where a harmful alteration of habitat is authorized by the Minister, losses shall be compensated by habitat replacement.\nThe strategies for achieving “no net loss” have focused primarily on project-by-project review, mainly in freshwater environments. A modern, more effective approach to achieve “no net loss” must assess the importance of habitat on an ecosystem basis, and balance the degree and type of impact with the most effective remedy. In evolving to a more integrated approach, the Department will make greater use of indicators to assess and monitor the health of freshwater and marine habitat.\nA new focus on the salmon habitat that is most productive, limiting, or at risk in a CU will clarify decision-making and better link habitat management strategies to harvest and salmon assessment (Strategy 4). Low risk activities, where measures to avoid or mitigate impacts are well understood, will be dealt with through other mechanisms such as guidelines and standards. This approach will ensure that all habitats are addressed and resources are focused where most required.\nIn order to effectively manage and protect aquatic systems where the productive capacity of habitat is at highest likelihood of loss, DFO must integrate its work with that of Provincial and other federal agencies, First Nations governments, stewardship groups, industry, and stakeholders. Environment Canada has primary responsibility for administering, on behalf of the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, pollution prevention and control authorities contained in the Fisheries Act. However, the jurisdiction for many of the land and water uses that may be detrimental to salmon resides with Provincial, Territorial or local governments. Success in protecting and restoring habitat demands a cooperative and collaborative approach among the various levels of government so that land and water use activities and decisions better support the needs of salmon. One such coordinating structure is the Pacific Council of Fisheries and Aquaculture Ministers and its subsidiary work groups. The council and the work groups can provide an organizational arrangement within which information can be shared and cooperative work developed and coordinated. Collaborative approaches such as this optimize the use of our collective resources.\n11DFO (1986), Policy for the Management of Fish Habitat.\n\f14 Wild Salmon Policy\nObjective 3 Manage fisheries for sustainable benefits\nThe conservation of wild salmon and their habitat is the highest priority in this policy. However, a policy that failed to consider the values that the harvesting of Pacific salmon provide to people would be incomplete. While everyone supports conservation, many people depend on salmon for their social and economic needs and insist on a balanced policy that provides for sustainable use of wild salmon.\nDFO has a responsibility to provide sustainable harvesting opportunities that will best meet its obligations to First Nations, contribute to social well-being, and provide employment and other economic benefits to individuals and fisheries-dependent communities. A significant challenge for this policy is to safeguard the genetic diversity of salmon while accounting for and realizing these benefits of the salmon catch. Since harvest restrictions necessary to conserve the wild salmon and affect individuals, cultural, social and economic impacts need to be considered.\ncommunities\nresource\nSome critics will suggest that consideration of the social and economic benefits arising from salmon harvesting will compromise salmon conservation. Others will claim that a focus on maintaining diversity means the elimination of major salmon fisheries. In reality, the interests of both salmon and people need to be accounted for\nin a successful conservation program. This policy reflects a management framework that can provide care and respect for a resource and its ecosystem and for the people within it. Protecting the resource base provides the maximum potential for benefits to people. The full measure of the WSP’s success will be the achievement of salmon conservation accompanied by human well-being.\nMaking the best decisions on salmon conservation cannot be done by scientists or other technical specialists alone. While choices must certainly be informed by scientific and technical information, the best decisions will ultimately reflect public values. This requires structured processes that: (1) establish specific objectives and priorities, and (2) allow the biological, social and economic consequences of different conservation measures and activities to be considered and weighed in an open and transparent way.\nFirst Nations, harvesters, environmental groups, and community interests in the resource need to be engaged directly in these processes, and in the determination of the most appropriate management actions. Individual and community involvement in salmon management decision- making, in turn, will sustain the social and cultural ties between people and salmon. These ties will ultimately lead to the more successful implementation of conservation plans and the better protection of wild salmon.\nS T R AT E G I E S A N D AC T I O N S T E P S\nThis policy will be implemented through six strategies summarized in Table 1. Strategies 1 through 3 provide the information on wild salmon populations, their habitats, and ecosystems required as information for decision-making and planning. Strategy 4 requires the integration of biological, social, and economic information to produce long- term strategic plans for salmon and habitat management for each conservation unit. Strategy 5 is the translation of strategic plans into annual operational plans and Strategy 6 is a commitment to ongoing review of the implementation and success of the Policy.\n(cid:228) \fWild Salmon Policy\n15\nThe WSP and the Precautionary Approach\nArticle 6.2: “States shall be more cautious when information is uncertain, unreliable or inadequate. The absence of adequate scientific information shall not be used as a reason for postponing or failing to take conservation and management measures.”\nArticle 6.2 of the UN Agreement (Relating to the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks, 1995)12 builds from the original declaration of a precautionary approach (Principle 15, Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, 1992), and is also included in the United Nations Fisheries and Agriculture Organization Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries (1995).\nPrecautionary approaches are now widely applied in fisheries management and the\nprotection of marine ecosystems. The approach identifies important considerations for management: acknowledgement of uncertainty in information and future impacts and the need for decision making in the absence of full information. It implies a reversal in the burden of proof and the need for longer term outlooks in conservation of resources.\nThe application of precaution in the WSP will follow the guidance provided to Federal\nDepartments by the Privy Council Office publication13 entitled “A Framework for the Application of Precaution in Science-based Decision Making About Risk.” (Canada, Privy Council Office 2003). That Framework includes five principles of precaution:\n• The application of the precautionary approach is a legitimate and distinctive decision-\nmaking approach within a risk management framework.\n• Decisions should be guided by society’s chosen level of risk.\n• Application of the precautionary approach should be based on sound scientific\ninformation.\n• Mechanisms for re-evaluation and transparency should exist.\n• A high degree of transparency, clear accountability, and meaningful public involvement\nare appropriate.\nThe WSP will adhere to the use of precaution and be consistent with the Privy Council\nOffice framework and FAO14 (1995, paragraph 6 (a-h)). For example, the introduction of a lower benchmark (Strategy 1) is a significant precautionary step in the conservation of Pacific salmon. In determining the value of the benchmark, all sources of uncertainty in assessment of the CU must be determined (for estimation of the buffer) and the Department and advisors must determine a risk tolerance to be applied in a risk management framework. Where assessment information is highly uncertain, more precautionary lower benchmarks will be defined.\n12See www.un.org/Depts/los/convention_agreements/convention_overview_fish_stocks.htm .\n13Canada Privy Council Office (2003), A Framework for the Application of Precaution in Science-based Decision-Making About Risk.\n14See FAO (1995), Precautionary approach to fisheries; Part 1: Guidelines on the precautionary approach to capture fisheries and species introductions.\n\f16 Wild Salmon Policy\nTable 1 WSP strategies and action steps\n\nStandardized monitoring of wild salmon status\n\nu Identify Conservation Units u Develop criteria to assess CUs and identify benchmarks to\nrepresent biological status\nu Monitor and assess status of CUs\n\nAssessment of habitat status\n\nu Document habitat characteristics within CUs u Select indicators and develop benchmarks for habitat assessment u Monitor and assess habitat status u Establish linkages to develop an integrated data system for\nwatershed management\n\nInclusion of ecosystem values and monitoring\n\nu Identify indicators to monitor status of freshwater ecosystems u Integrate climate and ocean information into annual salmon\nmanagement processes\n\nIntegrated strategic planning\n\nu Implement an interim process for management of priority CUs u Design and implement a fully integrated strategic\nplanning process for salmon conservation\n\nAnnual program delivery\n\nu Assess the status of Conservation Units and populations u Plan and conduct annual fisheries u Plan and implement annual habitat management activities u Plan and implement annual enhancement activities\n\nPerformance review\n\nu Conduct post-season review of annual workplans u Conduct regular reviews of the success of the WSP\nS T R AT E G Y 1 S TA N D A R D I Z E D M O N I TO R I N G O F W I L D S A L M O N S TAT U S\nThis policy requires a systematic process to organize all Pacific salmon streams and lakes into geographic units for conservation and specification of the means to monitor abundance and distribution of Pacific salmon within those units over time. The following Action Steps present how the Department will identify and assess wild salmon in BC and the Yukon in cooperation with First Nations and others.\nAction Step 1.1. Identify Conservation Units. Based on science and local knowledge, the salmon that use particular freshwater habitats will be aggregated into Conservation Units. CUs will be delineated consisting of one or more genetically similar interbreeding populations and have a defined geographic distribution. A CU will include\n15See www-sci.pac.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/sci/psarc/default_e.htm .\ngenetically similar lineages of fish, a spatial distribution of populations and demes, and be dependent on a set of habitats. This linkage recognizes the need for interconnected spawning populations for genetic processes, defines important habitat for these lineages and for future production, and identifies the groups of salmon whose status will be measured under this policy.\nthan\nThe delineation of CUs will be based on biological information, including genetic traits (e.g., DNA variants), polygenic traits (e.g., run timing, life history traits, ocean distribution, etc.), and ATK where available. Since the requirements and needs of First Nations and others may be at some CUs, scales finer geographic management objectives to address these may be recognized in Strategic plans (Strategy 4). The number of CUs for each species will be a function of our knowledge base and is expected to change over time. DFO will consult with local First Nations in accordance with its consultation obligations during the process of defining Conservation Units. As this work proceeds, it will be assessed through peer review (via the Pacific Scientific Advice Review Committee, PSARC).15 This review process facilitates participation by outside experts, First Nations, fisheries stakeholders, and the public; and will provide the means to modify the definition of CUs over time.\nAction Step 1.2. Develop criteria to assess CUs and identify benchmarks to represent biological status. The biological status of a CU will normally be based on the abundance and distribution of spawners in the unit, or proxies thereof. When a CU contains more than one population, it will be necessary to determine how abundance is distributed among the populations. For each CU, higher and lower benchmarks will be defined that will delimit three status zones: Green, Amber, and Red (Figure 3). As spawner abundance decreases, a CU moves towards the lower status zone, and the extent of management intervention for conservation purposes will increase.\n(cid:228) (cid:228) \fWild Salmon Policy\n17\nBiological Status Zones and Management Response\nA Conservation Unit in the Red zone is undesirable because of the risk of extirpation, and the loss of ecological benefits and salmon production. The presence of a CU in the Red zone will initiate an immediate consideration of ways to protect the fish, increase their abundance, and reduce the potential risk of loss. Biological considerations will be the primary drivers for the management of CUs with Red status.\nAmber status implies caution in the management of the CU.While a CU in the Amber zone should be at a low risk of loss, there will be a degree of lost production. Still, this situation may result when CUs share risk factors with other more productive units. Decisions about the conservation of CUs in the Amber zone will involve broader consideration of biological, social, and economic issues. Assuming a CU is assessed to be safe in the Amber zone (consistent with Principle 1), then the use of this CU involves a comparison of the benefits from restoring production versus the costs arising from limitations imposed on the use of other CUs to achieve that restoration.\nSocial and economic\nconsiderations will tend to be the primary drivers for the management of CUs in the Green zone, though ecosystem or other non-consumptive use values could also be considered.\nFigure 3 Benchmarks and biological status zones to be determined for each CU\nHigh\nExtent of management intervention\nLow\nLower Benchmark\nHigher Benchmark\nRed Zone\nAmber Zone\nGreen Zone\nLow\nSpawning abundance and distribution\nHigh\nBenchmarks identify when the biological production status of a CU has changed significantly, but do not prescribe specific restrictions. Changes in status will initiate management actions (see sidebar). The specific responses will vary among species, geographic regions and cause of the decline and will be determined through the integrated planning process described in Strategy 4. The use of status zones and generic methods to determine benchmarks recognizes variability in data quality and quantity and is consistent with current management approaches adopted by other agencies.16\nThe lower benchmark between Amber and Red will be established at a level of abundance high enough to ensure there is a substantial buffer between it and any level of abundance that could lead to a CU being considered at risk of extinction by COSEWIC. The buffer will account for uncertainty in data and control of harvest management. There is no single rule to use for determination of the lower benchmark. Rather, it will be determined on a case-by-case basis, and depend on available information, and the risk tolerance applied. The determination of the risk tolerance to apply is a value judgement that requires consultation with First Nations and others affected by this choice.\nExample criteria, depending on the species and types of information,\nmay be:17\n• The spawning escapement required to produce a percentage of the\nmaximum juvenile abundance (say 10–25%);\n• The spawning escapement estimated to permit recovery with an agreed probability within an acceptable period of time (e.g., 75% confidence within three salmon generations);\n16Mace et al. (2003), Report of the NMFS National Standard 1 Guidelines Working Group, and DFO (2004b), Proceedings of the National Meeting on Applying the Precautionary Approach in Fisheries Management.\n17The values presented in these example criteria are for explanation only and do not limit any consideration of other values or other criteria that may be determined for a specific CU.\n\f18 Wild Salmon Policy\n• The abundance and distribution of spawners within a CU sufficient to provide confidence that the CU does not have a high probability of extirpation (e.g., &lt;5% chance of loss over 50 years); or\n• A proportion of the number of spawners (S) estimated necessary to provide maximum sustained yield (MSY) on an average annual basis given existing environmental conditions (e.g., 25 per cent of Smsy).\nWithin the Red zone, there will be a level of abundance that cannot sustain further mortalities due to fishing or change to freshwater or marine habitats. Further mortality in such a CU will lead to continued decline in the spawner abundance and an increasing probability of extirpation. Determining this level in the zone is a continuing discussion in salmon assessment literature and is not specified in this policy. The Department will prepare and publish operational guidelines on the estimation of this level. The management response to this level will be determined on a case by case basis, in consultation with First Nations, and others affected by this determination.\nThe higher benchmark between Green and Amber will be established to identify whether harvests are greater or less than the level expected to provide, on an average annual basis, the maximum annual catch for a CU, given existing environ- mental conditions. This level will vary through time but there would not be a high probability of losing\n18See Hilborn and Walters (1992), Quantitative fisheries stock assessment.\nthe CU. As with the lower benchmark, the upper benchmark will also be determined on a case-by- case basis depending on the species and types of information available, and may apply:\n• A proportion of the number of spawners (S) estimated necessary to provide maximum sustainable yield (MSY) on an average annual basis given existing environmental conditions (e.g., Smsy);\n• An exploitation rate for the CU that would limit harvest based on a rate of fishing mortality rather than the number of fish killed;\n• The number of smolts (or spawners) estimated to correspond with habitat capacity; or\n• A proportion of the long term average\nspawning abundance.\nAction Step 1.3. Monitor and assess status of CUs. Salmon assessment involves the use of various analyses to make quantitative predictions about the reaction of a population to alternative management plans.18 Two important components of this statement are that assessments should be quantitative and are conducted to provide advice for management (including conservation when necessary). For wild salmon in the BC and Yukon, however, quantitative assessment is a complex and potentially costly task, involving numerous data sources and hundreds of populations. Consequently, the Department has utilized three levels of annual monitoring programs in the assessment of Pacific salmon:\n\nIndicator systems: Comprehensive programs involving quantitative information on the spawning adults, juveniles produced, mature progeny produced (reported in the catch and spawning numbers) from the specific system. These programs are the most information rich and expensive but provide critical information for management such as productivity and sustainable rates of\n\n(cid:228) \fWild Salmon Policy\n19\nexploitation (population dynamic values), survival rates for major life history phases (e.g., freshwater and marine survival), and exploitation patterns and rates in fisheries.\n\nIntensive monitoring: Annual surveys of the numbers of salmon in specific subsets of streams or habitats within a geographic area. These surveys involve quantitative designs that can be replicated annually to provide consistent indices of spawners between years. The accuracy and precision of the estimates will vary with methodologies and habitats but the essential component is that there is a high degree of confidence that inter-annual trends are accurately assessed. For example, methods may involve in-river test fisheries, counting weirs, mark-recapture programs, area-under-the-curve estimators, and surveys of juvenile production in streams and lakes.\nExtensive monitoring: Surveys that are generally the least expensive but enable the broadest coverage of streams or other habitats within a geographic area. These surveys are useful for examining salmon distribution, consistency of patterns throughout the region, and checks on habitat changes. They are usually visually based, may be repeated within a year, and may include randomly selected samples of the streams or habitats in a large geographic area. Examples of these surveys are over-flights, stream walks or floats, and could involve only portions of a stream instead of the entire system.\n\nFor each CU, a statistically based and cost effective monitoring plan will be designed and will build on existing programs and local partnerships (e.g., First Nations agreements, local Streamkeeper or enhancement groups). Monitoring programs must assess the annual abundance of the CU and the distribution of spawners. The assessment procedures applied will vary between CUs but monitoring plans for each CU will be documented and information reported annually. The benchmarks specified for a CU must be stated in units consistent\nwith the monitoring program for that CU in order that the annual status of the CU can be assessed. A core program (i.e., an agreed minimum monitoring plan) will be established by the Department and partners and funded annually to maintain the long- term information fundamental to management of local salmon resources. Each monitoring plan will be peer reviewed to ensure application of appropriate designs and methods, best use of available resources for monitoring, and to ensure that information management systems have been developed. A key objective of these monitoring programs will be to make certain that data collected are utilized and timely for the provision of advice. Assessment results for a CU compared to its two benchmarks will determine the biological status of the CU. This status determination will help to guide resource management planning and further stock assessment activities. When a CU is in the Green zone, a detailed analytical assessment of its biological status will not usually be needed. For a CU in the Amber zone, a detailed assessment may be necessary as input to Strategies 2 and 3 below. If the CU is classified as Red, a detailed assessment will normally be triggered to examine impacts on the CU of fishing, habitat degradation, and other human for restoration.\nfactors, and evaluate potential\n\f20 Wild Salmon Policy\nSTRATEGY TWO ASSESSMENT OF HABITAT STATUS\nThe maintenance of sound, productive salmon habitat in both fresh water and the marine environment depends on good scientific information, timely measures to prevent habitat disruption, and compliance with regulatory directives. Habitat management and protection require identification of the habitats necessary for the conservation of wild salmon and assessment of changes in their status over time. This will enable the evaluation of the effectiveness of regulatory, planning and public awareness measures, establishment of priorities, and guide regulatory and enforcement interventions. Strategy 2 will address thereby complementing DFO regulatory and compliance programs and improving our capacity to proactively monitor and protect habitat.\ninformation needs,\nthese\nAn overview of important habitat and habitat issues within CUs will be developed and habitat status will be assessed using indicators that combine scientific and local knowledge and recognize sensitive life stages and habitats. Indicators will be selected to be reflective of overall habitat health then tracked to assist in habitat planning within DFO and other jurisdictions, including First Nations\ngovernments, the Province of BC and local governments. Habitat data gathered from many sources within and outside DFO will be linked and made more accessible for habitat planning. The assessment will highlight good quality habitat that needs to be maintained and protected, and degraded habitats that need to be restored or rehabilitated on the scale of watersheds and Conservation Units to inform strategic and annual planning for salmon conservation. Through integrated resource planning, DFO’s Habitat Management Program will evolve to link habitat protection, resource assessment and stewardship with fish production.\nThese Action Steps represent a major change and will be implemented progressively to improve the effectiveness of DFO’s program for protecting salmon habitat. The reshaping of the program will focus regulatory and enforcement responsiveness and effectiveness, strengthen linkages between habitat protection and fish production objectives, and provide guidance to watershed planning initiatives.\nAction Step 2.1. Document habitat characteristics within CUs Habitat requirements for Pacific salmon vary by species, life history characteristics and phase, and geography. CUs identified in Strategy 1 will include genetically similar lineages that are dependent on a set of habitats. The identification of the habitats that support or limit salmon production in watersheds and CUs will inform assessment, monitoring and protection priorities.\nInformation from multiple sources will be assembled by DFO at appropriate geographic scales to describe habitat conditions for individual CUs. Such sources include government agencies, First Nations, watershed-based fish sustainability plans, existing watershed processes, stewardship groups and oceans integrated management. An overview report will be prepared for each CU that will provide sufficient information on key habitats to for protection, identify rehabilitation, and restoration. It will also identify information gaps and factors, such as water quality and quantity, that potentially threaten the future\ninitial priorities\n(cid:228) \fWild Salmon Policy\n21\nhealth and productivity of habitats in the CU. This information will contribute to watershed planning with First Nations governments, industry, stewards and other jurisdictions and will serve as an effective initial guide for habitat protection and planning priorities in Strategies 4 and 5. This improved understanding of salmon habitats will also be valuable as an educational tool for stakeholders.\nAction Step 2.2. Select indicators and develop benchmarks for habitat assessment A variety of quantitative and qualitative indicators of habitat status exist. In fresh water, examples include water quality, temperature, stream flow, fish and invertebrate densities, and features such as quantities of good quality gravel. In estuarine and marine environments, Marine Environmental Quality standards may be used along with physical habitat indicators.\nIndicators for CU’s on a watershed scale will be selected to assess the quantity and quality of the habitats identified in Action Step 2.1. Indicators may be general across CU’s or specifically selected on a case-by-case basis for specific CU’s and habitat types. Government agencies, First Nations governments, watershed planning processes and stewardship groups will be asked to provide advice on the development or selection of key indicators for their watersheds, based on local knowledge and information on the kinds of data that are available. Benchmarks will be developed to reflect the desired values of each key indicator. For example benchmarks for water temperatures could reflect optimal temperature range for salmon and will vary by species. Similarly, for an indicator such as gravel quality, the proportion of fine sediment as substrate in spawning areas could be utilized. Biological status indicators may also be used to validate habitat benchmarks. Benchmarks will be set that reflect our intent to take action to protect and restore habitat on a preventative basis as required, before population abundance declines in response to degraded habitat.\nThe product of this Action Step will be a set of indicators for CUs and benchmarks for the indicators.\nAction Step 2.3. Monitor and assess habitat status Based on the framework described in Action Steps 2.1 and 2.2, ongoing monitoring will be implemented to identify changes in habitat condition over time. This monitoring will be integrated with salmon assessments and ecosystem evaluations. The intent will be to better understand the relationship between changes in habitat condition and changes in salmon production and distribution within the CU. Monitoring will also be used to assess the effectiveness of regulatory decisions and rehabilitation measures. All monitoring results will inform both longer-term strategic planning and annual operations in habitat management. If a decline in habitat quality or quantity over time is detected, efforts will be made to identify the causes and response measures will be considered as part of an integrated management plan for the Conservation Unit.\nThe implementation of monitoring and assessment of habitat status will provide four key inputs to guide habitat management. These are:\n• Important habitat in need of protection to\nmaintain salmon productivity;\n• Habitat risks and constraints that are\nadversely affecting that productivity;\n• Areas where habitat\nrestoration or rehabilitation would be desirable to restore or enhance productivity; and\n• Investigations to fill information gaps.\n(cid:228) (cid:228) \f22 Wild Salmon Policy\nThese key inputs will also guide the integrated strategic plans (Strategy 4), where long term priorities for habitat protection and restoration will be established to complement fish production objectives and Strategy 5 where annual plans will be developed, including ongoing compliance and regulatory functions. These inputs will also be useful for other jurisdictions responsible for components of salmon habitat.\nThis information will allow DFO to recognize and protect the habitats required for the conservation of wild salmon using tools appropriate to the circumstances. Through risk assessment and planning, efforts will be focused where there are activities with a high likelihood of significant impacts and where there are sensitive and important habitats. Activities with a low likelihood of impact or those that impact other habitats will be dealt with through the use of guidelines and standards. All habitats will be addressed but protection and recovery efforts will vary depending on the habitat value.\nAction Step 2.4. Establish linkages to develop an integrated data system for watershed management Together with the Province of British Columbia and other partners, DFO will promote the design, implementation, and maintenance of a linked, collaborative system to increase access to information on fish habitat status. A more unified salmon\nhabitat data system can be achieved by improving common access to the extensive data holdings of DFO, Provincial and Territorial agencies, other levels of government, and stakeholders that describe watersheds and habitat conditions. Improved sharing of information will accelerate and strengthen assessment and reporting of habitat status for CUs. Over time, it will also allow cumulative changes in habitats and wild salmon status to be identified and appropriate actions taken.\nSTRATEGY 3 INCLUSION OF ECOSYSTEM VALUES AND MONITORING\nPacific salmon play important roles in marine (oceanic, coastal, and estuarine), freshwater (lake, stream, and wetland), and terrestrial ecosystems (adjacent to streams and rivers, the riparian zone). There is ample scientific evidence demonstrating that nutrients derived from salmon carcasses are important to freshwater and riparian ecosystems. However, few studies provide advice on the numbers of salmon necessary for healthy freshwater ecosystems, or link these ecosystems with the dramatic effect that changes in climate and marine conditions can have on the survival and production of Pacific salmon. For example, it is now known that the ocean’s capacity for salmon production can be limited, is highly variable over time, and can have an enormous effect on the abundance and condition of adult salmon (e.g., body size, energy content). Survival rates from when salmon enter the sea until they return to coastal waters as adults have been measured to vary by more than a hundredfold (even a thousand fold in some cases).\nA challenge for the Wild Salmon Policy is the need for development of an ecosystem objective that is widely appreciated but difficult to quantify. Coupled with this uncertainty is increasing concern for long-term climate change that will affect marine and freshwater ecosystems. Monitoring this variation and implementing appropriate management responses to address potential impacts will be increasingly important to future conservation efforts.\n(cid:228) \fThe Department’s intent is to progressively consider ecosystem values in salmon management, but it acknowledges a limited ability to do so at the present time. The following steps will provide the scientific understanding and technical capacity to include ecosystem values over time.\nAction Step 3.1. Identify indicators to monitor status of freshwater ecosystems The Department will use existing data and expert advice to identify key indicators (biological, physical, and chemical) of the current and potential state of lake and stream ecosystems (diversity of organisms, rates of biological production, etc.). Within two years, an ecosystem monitoring and assessment approach will be developed and integrated with ongoing assessments and reporting on the status of wild salmon. Implementation of this approach will be coordinated with the monitoring of CU status (Action Step 1.3), their habitats (Action Step 2.3), and marine conditions (Action Step 3.2). In the process, knowledge gaps and areas requiring further research will also be identified.\nAction Step 3.2. Integrate climate and ocean information into annual salmon management processes To understand changes in climate and oceans and their consequences for salmon production, the freshwater monitoring programs identified in Step 3.1 will be integrated with programs investigating variability in climate and ocean conditions. Canada is developing programs to monitor and study these conditions. To relate variations in freshwater and marine ecosystems, networks of freshwater indicator systems (see Action Step 1.3) are being discussed internationally to assess the magnitude and spatial scale of changes in climate and ocean conditions. Linking variations in salmon returns to changes in the marine ecosystems requires large-scale monitoring programs, extensive planning, and collaboration with domestic and international organizations.\nInformation on climate and marine conditions will continue to be provided through DFO’s State of the Ocean reports, and will be linked with assessments of the marine survival of Pacific salmon. Coupled with results from Action Step 3.1 and ongoing assessment of salmon survival, research in this area should lead to improved understanding of production dynamics and better management of Pacific salmon. This step is also linked to Canada’s Oceans Strategy, which recognizes the need to better understand ecosystem dynamics, including climate variability and impact of change on living marine resources.\nA more comprehensive view of salmon production and its determinants, from egg to spawning adult, is necessary to direct management actions more accurately and effectively conserve Pacific salmon resources in an uncertain future.\nWild Salmon Policy\n23\nClimate Change and Wild Salmon\nThere is increasing evidence and support that the world’s climate is changing and, in particular, that “global warming” is taking place.19\nThe climate-related effects anticipated for wild salmon are difficult to predict. Common expectations include increased summer water temperatures, changes in seasonal flows, more extreme flow events, and changes to ecosystems. When and where change occurs will also be highly variable. So how can the Wild Salmon Policy possibly protect Pacific salmon against these events? The WSP will have limited ability to directly protect salmon from climate change, but the policy’s premise – to protect diversity and their habitats – is critical to allowing Pacific salmon to adapt to future changes. By maintaining the genetic diversity of wild salmon and the integrity of their habitat and ecosystems, the WSP will help ensure viable wild salmon populations in the future.At the same time, while salmon adjust to these pressures, managers could expect productivity and allowable catches to decline.\nThe importance of protecting\ndiversity and maintaining healthy diverse populations of fish was also recognized as an important strategy in a recent federal government report on climate change impacts and adaptation.20\n19See the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (www.ipcc.ch/) and British Columbia Ministry of Water, Land and Air Protection (2002), Indicators of Climate Change in British Columbia.\n20Natural Resources Canada (2004), Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation: A Canadian Perspective.\n(cid:228) (cid:228) \f24 Wild Salmon Policy\nRecent Progress Towards Integrated Management – the Integrated Salmon Harvest Planning Committee\nSome early progress towards integrated management has already been achieved with salmon harvest planning in BC. For example, the recently formed Integrated Salmon Harvest Planning Committee includes elected representatives from all commercial gear and area groups, and representatives nominated by First Nations and the sports fishing community, non-governmental environmental organizations, and the Province of British Columbia. As operation of this committee evolves, it will help to provide inclusive and balanced information for the development of commercial and recreational fishing plans that respect First Nations food, social and ceremonial fisheries and other obligations to First Nations.This is a useful starting point, but much more needs to be done to link the work of the committee with other more localized watershed-based planning processes and interests, as well as with broader marine area planning initiatives.\nS T R AT E G Y 4 I N T E G R AT E D S T R AT E G I C P L A N N I N G\nThe life cycle of Pacific salmon necessitates a planning process that addresses salmon conservation from the eggs in the gravel in parental generations to the eggs in the gravel produced by their offspring (see Figure 4). Planning for Pacific salmon presently falls short of this need. Many different planning activities currently take place, each with its own role but operating in relative independence from others. A demanding challenge in implementing the Wild Salmon Policy will be the establishment of an effective planning process that fully addresses the conservation of Pacific salmon, meets the federal government’s obligations to First Nations, considers the needs of other Canadians, and involves those affected by decisions. Strategy 4 is intended to address this challenge.\nThe purpose of Strategy 4 is to develop long-term strategic plans for CUs and groups of CUs and their habitat subject to common risk factors. These plans will account for their biological status and provide recommendations on salmon conservation that reflect the interests of people at local and regional levels. Strategies 1, 2 and 3 will provide information on the status of the CUs, their habitat and the ecosystem as inputs to the planning process. However, strategic plans need to integrate this information and:\n• Specify long-term biological targets for CUs and groups of CUs\nthat ensure conservation and sustainable use;\n• Identify recommended resource management actions to protect or restore Pacific salmon, their habitats, and ecosystems in order to achieve these targets; and\n• Establish timeframes and priorities for actions.\nConsistent with the goal and objectives of the WSP, the plans must be designed to safeguard the genetic diversity of wild salmon, maintain the integrity of their habitat and ecosystem and result in fisheries that are managed for sustainable benefits. To do this, the plans will need to address the causes of any declines and identify the resource management actions necessary to remedy them where possible. The preferred long-term outcome of the plans will be healthy habitat and ecosystems and CUs above their higher benchmarks. But as a minimum, the plans must be capable of maintaining and restoring all CUs above their established lower benchmarks with an acceptable degree of certainty within a defined time frame. The development of these plans will require choices. The short and long term benefits as well as costs of decisions must be well documented and explicitly consider uncertainties in not only the scientific information, but also in the economic and social information that decision makers use. Ultimately, these strategic plans will inform the development of annual fishery management, habitat, and enhancement plans and form the basis for ongoing dialogue with First Nations governments, Provincial, Territorial and local governments and other private parties whose support and cooperation is essential to sustain Pacific salmon in Canada.\n\fEstablishing an integrated process to achieve such plans will not be easy or immediate. Successful development and implementation will require extensive effort and cooperation between all levels of government and many different interests. Strategy 4 therefore includes two Action Steps to achieve the goal and objectives of the policy:\n• The establishment of an interim process (Step 4.1) that provides\nfor immediate progress; and\n• The development of a new integrated planning structure that will better meet the needs of the resource over the longer term (Step 4.2).\nFigure 4 WSP integrated strategic planning will cover all stages\nof Pacific salmon life history\nIN\ng nin\nn a l P t s e v r a H\nIN\nTEGRATED STRATEGICPLANNIN Watersh\nG\ne d Pl a n n i n g\nFreshwater\nSalmon Production Cycle\nOcean\nEstuary\nCoastal Waters\nTEGRATED STRATEGICPLANNIN MarineCoastal Planning\nG\nAction Step 4.1: Implement an interim process for management of priority CUs At present across BC and the Yukon, planning related to salmon occurs at various geographic scales and for a variety of purposes. Bi-lateral consultations take place with individual First Nations. Watershed-Based Fish Sustainability Planning (WFSP) initiatives are underway in local areas involving First Nations governments, the Province, local stewardship groups, and other community interests brought together to sustain fish habitat. More broadly, Integrated Fisheries Management Plans (IFMP) are developed for Northern British Columbia, Southern British Columbia, and the Yukon in consultation with individual harvesting groups and others interested in Pacific salmon. Marine use planning, a key component of Canada’s Ocean Strategy and Action Plan, is proceeding on a pilot basis. At the broadest geographic scale, the Government of Canada with input from advisors engages in planning related to the Pacific Salmon Treaty and other international agreements such as the North Pacific Anadromous Fish Convention.\nWild Salmon Policy\n25\nLinking CUs, Fisheries, and Watersheds for Planning Purposes\nSalmon management is complex, involving five species divided into numerous Conservation Units in many watersheds that are exploited by various users in a myriad of fisheries. Considerations of biology and geography need to be brought together in an organized way with social and economic considerations for practical and efficient planning and fully informed decision-making.\nIn some cases a CU will encompass a relatively large geographic area that includes more than one population or watershed with a number of discrete fisheries targeted at sub-components of the CU. In these cases habitat, fisheries and marine area planning may need to proceed at a finer scale than the CU in its entirety (e.g., perhaps a watershed scale). In other cases there will be interdependencies and overlap between fisheries and among species within individual watersheds. In these cases planning for the conservation and sustainable use of an individual CU should not be done in isolation from other CUs within the watershed.\nIn these latter circumstances,\nCUs may need to be aggregated for planning purposes. For example, a wide range of user groups in numerous different fisheries harvest Skeena River sockeye salmon. Skeena River sockeye may include more than 20 CUs originating throughout the Skeena River drainage system. Habitat, fisheries, and marine area planning for any CU within the system must consider and account for potential impacts on all the others. As a result, the appropriate planning unit for Skeena sockeye will likely encompass all these associated sockeye CUs and the entire Skeena River watershed.\n(CONTINUED ON PAGE 26)\n(cid:228) \f26 Wild Salmon Policy\n(CONTINUED FROM PAGE 25)\nLinking CUs, Fisheries, and Watersheds for Planning Purposes\nAlthough the resulting plan will\nbe developed for the aggregate in these cases, the ultimate effect will be individual plans for each CU within the aggregate. Planning choices made at the aggregate level with respect to habitat, enhancement, and fisheries management measures will effectively translate into impacts on and targets for each of the individual CUs within the aggregate. However, the plan for each individual CU will reflect full consideration of the impacts on all other CUs within the aggregate.\nIt is anticipated that between 50\nand 60 planning units (defined by fisheries, geographic location and watershed) will be needed to cover all CUs of Pacific salmon. Some planning units will encompass com- ponents of CUs and some will encompass groups of CUs subject to one or more common risk factors. The number and scale of these planning units will facilitate practical and efficient planning for wild salmon.\nUltimately, these diverse planning processes and the various interests involved need to be linked to provide inclusive and comprehensive input to integrated plans that encompass salmon, fisheries, watersheds, and marine areas throughout British Columbia and Yukon. In addition, broader and more direct linkages with First Nations governments, Provincial, Territorial and local governments need to be forged so that other land and water use activities and decisions better support the needs of salmon.\nUntil a fully integrated planning process can be established an interim approach is needed that will immediately improve integration between habitat, enhancement, fisheries, and marine area planning, and provide more inclusive input to resource management. This interim approach will meet the Department’s obligations to consult First Nations and respect the process for salmon planning defined in the Nisga’a Final Agreement. In addition, advice from harvesters, stewardship groups and others will be gathered using existing processes.\nInterim procedures will build on and expand the approach now used to develop IFMP’s for salmon. The biological status of a CU or group of CUs vulnerable to fisheries in an area will be reviewed.21 CUs in the Red zone and those that could significantly limit fishing and other activities will be identified as management priorities. The protection and restoration of these CUs will be primary drivers for harvest, habitat and enhancement planning. For these priority CUs, DFO will consult with First Nations and then bring together the various interests from existing processes to provide recommendations for protection and restoration. In collaboration with the Department, these “response teams” will collate and consider information from all sources and make recommendations using a five-step planning procedure outlined in Appendix 2. It is proposed that response teams would include representatives of First Nations and other local and regional interests. Their recommendations will inform regional planning and program delivery and will be subject to consultation with First Nations as required. In addition, during this interim period the Department will pay careful attention to identifying and responding to any other vulnerable CUs so they do not decline in status.\nResource management recommendations from response teams will be guided by precautionary approaches and will be consistent with the first principle of this policy. Specifically, recommendations will be expected to provide an acceptable degree of confidence that these priority CUs will rebuild beyond the lower benchmark within a defined time frame. The progress made towards achieving biological targets for priority CUs will be reviewed annually (as described in Strategy 6) and adjustments to plans made as appropriate. This interim process will be used until overall responsibilities for the development of long term strategic plans for all CUs can be assumed by a new planning structure (Action Step 4.2).\n21The concept of planning units for Pacific salmon is described in the side bar “Linking CUs, Fisheries and Watersheds for Planning Purposes” and is an organizational construct that will be used to associate a group of CUs (CUs that are subject to common risk factors) with regional fisheries.\n\fWild Salmon Policy\n27\nModern Treaties and the Planning Process\nThe Nisga’a Final Agreement is the first “modern” treaty entered into in British Columbia and applies to the management of salmon originating in the Nass Area, as defined in the Final Agreement. The Final Agreement provides that the Nisga’a Nation has the right to harvest chinook, chum, coho, sockeye and pink salmon originating in the Nass Area. Under the Nisga’a Final Agreement, representatives of the federal government and the Nisga’a Lisims Government participate on a Joint Fisheries Management Committee (JFMC) to facilitate cooperative planning and conduct of Nisga’a fisheries and enhancement initiatives in the Nass Area. Various responsibilities are assigned to the JFMC, including providing advice concerning escapement goals and making recommendations to the Minister and Nisga’a Lisims Government in respect of other conservation requirements and the management of fish and aquatic plants.\nPlanning and implementation of the Wild Salmon Policy, as it applies to salmon originating in the Nass Area, will be in accordance with the Nisga’a Final Agreement.The JFMC will play a key role in this work. Similarly, the Department will act in accordance with the provisions of the Yukon Final Agreements when dealing with salmon conservation pertaining to the treaty settlement areas.\nAction Step 4.2: Design and implement a fully integrated strategic planning process for salmon conservation. The Department will consult with First Nations, Provincial and Territorial governments, communities, and stakeholders to design an effective integrated planning process that respects people’s interests in Pacific salmon, land and water uses, watersheds, fisheries, and marine areas. This policy does not dictate that process. Those affected need to be directly involved in the process design and implementation. It is however appropriate to describe what is envisioned. The planning process will ultimately consist of a new planning structure that will develop the plans through an organized procedure.\nA Ne w Pl a n n i n g St r u c t u re\nThe new planning structure will be tasked with developing long-term strategic plans for CUs that will guide fisheries and other activities in specific geographic areas affecting the CUs. These plans will need to determine long term biological targets for CUs and for habitat and ecosystem status and address significant conservation concerns by ensuring that all CUs will remain above their established lower benchmarks with an acceptable degree of certainty. The development of these plans will need to consider risks to wild salmon, as summarized in the status assessment of the CU, and weigh the biological, social and economic impacts of fishing and other activities (Principle 3).\nGovernments must operate in a manner consistent with the terms of treaties negotiated with First Nations such as the Nisga’a Final Agreement. Governments also have a legal obligation to consult with First Nations and depending on the strength of the claim of Aboriginal rights or Aboriginal title and the seriousness of the potential adverse effect of a decision on the claimed rights or title, accommodate their interests where Governments have knowledge of the potential existence of Aboriginal rights or Aboriginal title and are making decisions that might adversely affect these rights or title. Bilateral consultations between Governments and First Nations will be a foundation for the new integrated planning structure. In addition, measures taken by Federal, Provincial and Territorial governments to protect First Nation salmon fisheries will be a starting point for the development of long term strategic plans for wild salmon.\nThe results of these First Nations consultations will then need to be complemented by broader local and eventually region-wide input. It is suggested that local planning committees for sub-regions need to be established that can bring together all local First Nations governments, harvesters, community interests, local and regional government and other stakeholders to link with more localized projects important to local areas (like Watershed-based Fish Sustainability Planning processes) and assemble, assess and analyze information and seek local consensus. In addition, the various interests involved in local planning will need to be\n(cid:228) \f28 Wild Salmon Policy\nKey Attributes of an Effective Planning Process\nAn effective planning structure will require that the various interests involved build the mutual trust necessary to work together toward their goals. Key attributes of the new structure should be:\nInclusiveness All parties that are affected by a planning outcome should have the opportunity to provide input to the articulation of objectives, the identification of management options, and the evaluation and selection of management alternatives. All parties should respect the others’ opinions and processes, and work towards consensus.\nTransparency Responsibility for final decision-making and linkages between the various parts of the planning structure should be clearly described and agreed upon. Information considered in making recommendations should be publicly available and communicated in a timely manner. Recommendations and decisions should be carefully described and the reasons for them clearly explained.\nEffectiveness Individual planning bodies within the planning structure should be small enough to provide for focused discussion and dialogue but large enough to represent the full range of interests in the matters under discussion.\nRespect for Consultation Processes with First Nations Governments have a legal obligation to consult with First Nations. Any new planning process will not compromise or undermine existing consultation processes with First Nations. Planning processes will be in accordance with any applicable provisions of the Nisga’a Final Agreement, the Yukon Final Agreements, and any other treaties entered into between the federal government and First Nations.\nRespect for Other Existing Processes The results of other planning processes must also be respected, particularly those that deal with legal requirements under SARA and other federal legislation and obligations under international treaties.\nAccountability Participants in the planning process must be accountable to the people they represent by defending the advice they have provided and to the process by defending the manner in which decisions were made.\n\fWild Salmon Policy\n29\nbrought together region-wide to confirm overall support and resolve any inconsistencies between local plans. The number and the geographic scale of local area planning committees and the relationship between First Nation consultation processes, local, and region-wide committees in this planning structure are key matters to be resolved through consultation.\nThere will be two keys to success for a new planning structure. First, given the central importance of First Nations salmon fisheries, there will ideally need to be a high degree of support and participation by First Nations at all levels of the planning structure. The role and the terms of reference for new multi-party committees within the structure will need to be carefully crafted in consultation with First Nations and other interests to meet this need. The Department recognizes that the provisions for participation of First Nations will need to respect their individual governance structures. Second, there will need to be a high degree of support and involvement of Provincial, Territorial and local government at both local and region-wide levels of the structure. Bringing the constitutional and administrative mandates of these other levels of government to manage land, water and waste to the table will dramatically enhance and improve the chances for success of strategic planning efforts. This will require strong efforts by the Department and others to build the necessary political will and commitment for these other levels of government to support and participate in the planning process.\nA Pl a n n i n g Pro c e d u re\nThe development of strategic plans for CUs should follow a formal and open procedure that will result in informed decision-making.\nThis policy presents a five-step procedure for development of the strategic plans that breaks down decision-making into a logical and manageable sequence. This procedure is detailed in Appendix 2. It seeks to engage the various interests in Pacific salmon throughout the development of the plans – from the establishment of planning priorities through to the evaluation and selection of the\npreferred management alternative. This will explicitly encourage the pursuit of creative solutions and help to focus planning discussions on the relevant issues and considerations throughout the development of plans. This is intended to build consensus on the most appropriate management approach and facilitate public understanding of final management decisions.\nThe Minister of Fisheries and Oceans is accountable to Parliament for the conservation of fisheries resources. Accordingly, strategic plans for salmon conservation and sustainable use will be subject to final approval by the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans. The Minister may reject plans or elements of plans because they do not adequately conserve wild salmon. Alternatively, in exceptional circumstances, where recommended management actions are assessed to be ineffective, or the social and economic costs will be extreme, the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans may decide to limit the extent of active measures undertaken. The new planning process described above is expected to minimize the need for such decisions, but this possibility should be recognized. The rationale for such decisions will be clearly explained. In addition, any cumulative effect of these decisions will be closely monitored.\n\f30 Wild Salmon Policy\nEnhancement and Wild Salmon\nEnhancement of Pacific salmon has been largely delivered through the Salmonid Enhancement Program (SEP). SEP was launched in 1977 to augment production for harvest through a combination of natural and artificial enhancement techniques. The program was also designed to involve the public, raise awareness of the salmon resource, and generate jobs and economic development in coastal and First Nations communities. Its focus has since broadened to encompass rebuilding depleted stocks for conservation purposes with a greater emphasis on the integration of harvest and habitat management with stock rebuilding. The program uses a rebuilding strategy whereby a portion of the enhanced fish spawn naturally in the waters from which they originated in order to rebuild or maintain the population. This means that in river systems where there is a hatchery or spawning channel, fish spawning naturally in the river may consist of both wild and enhanced salmon. The probability of genetic changes to wild salmon is controlled by the use of native populations for broodstock and broodstock collection and spawning guidelines.\nEnhancement activities have contributed a significant proportion of the salmon produced in British Columbia and the Yukon. The proportion varies by species, geographic area, and year, but since the 1980s, 10 to 20 per cent of the BC commercial catch has originated from SEP. Moreover, some recreational fisheries are dependent on enhanced salmon, such as mark- selective fisheries on coho salmon, and various freshwater fisheries. As part of integrated strategic plans, enhancement will continue to be used as a means of addressing social and biological objectives through the rebuilding of populations with an unacceptable chance of extirpation by providing harvest opportunities and fishery benefits.\nSEP has developed many useful tools for producing and restoring Pacific salmon, and it\nenjoys substantial public support. Evaluations undertaken for enhancement also provide important data used for the assessment and management of wild salmon. However, enhancement, particularly hatcheries, poses some acknowledged risks to wild salmon. Wild populations harvested with more productive enhanced populations may be overexploited. Hatchery practices may alter genetic diversity. Wild salmon may have to compete with enhanced salmon for food and space in the marine and freshwater environments. SEP employs practices to minimize these risks including:\n• guidelines to manage spawning and hatchery practices to maintain genetic diversity and\nminimize impacts on resident freshwater juveniles\n• review and licencing of all fish movements under Section 55/56 of the Fishery (General)\nRegulations\n• annual planning processes that link\n– hatchery production with planning of major fisheries targeting enhanced populations\n– hatchery assessment with stock assessment planning frameworks to ensure that\nenhanced indicator populations can be effectively used for both the assessment of enhancement programs and for wild salmon assessment and management\n\fWild Salmon Policy\n31\nAquaculture\nOver the past decade, production from salmon aquaculture has expanded threefold, and the value of farmed salmon now exceeds that from commercial salmon fisheries. The industry’s development has provided employment and income in coastal communities, where economic opportunities are often limited. This expansion has not been without controversy.\nJurisdiction for the regulation of aquaculture is shared between the Federal and Provincial governments. The provision of aquatic land tenures and the licencing of aquaculture operations in BC is the responsibility of the Provincial government. The Department’s role, as the lead federal agency for aquaculture, is to manage aquaculture so that it is environmentally sustainable, socially responsible, and economically viable. In 2002 the Department released the Aquaculture Policy Framework (APF)22 to guide the Department’s actions with respect to aquaculture. The first principle of the APF directs the Department to support aquaculture development in a manner consistent with its commitments to ecosystem-based and integrated management, as set out in Departmental legislation, regulations and policies. This principle reflects the Department’s mandate for the conservation of marine resources.\nIt is recognized that aquaculture operations, as with other human activities, pose risks to\nthe natural environment. These potenial impacts to wild salmon include: the chance of disease and parasite transfer, competition and genetic effects of escapes, and physical disturbances in near-shore environments. Risks are addressed through mitigation measures such as Fish Health Management Plans, improved cage structures and proper farm siting.\nAll fish farm sites must undergo a review for potential habitat effects under Section 35 of\nthe Fisheries Act. The review includes evaluation of information on the size of the farm combined with specific features of the site such as benthic habitat and water currents and is intended to minimize the effects on important habitat such as eelgrass beds. Subsequent monitoring is carried out in conjunction with Provincial agencies.\nThe vast majority of marine fish farm sites also require, through either a Fisheries Act\nauthorization or Navigable Waters Act permit, a screening for a broad range of environmental effects under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act (CEAA). The CEAA screening examines the potential environmental effects of the project, judges the effectiveness of mitigation measures and assesses any residual impacts on the environment. A screening for a fish farm site encompasses all the potential effects on the natural environment, including the impacts of disease and parasite transfers, escapes, waste discharges and impacts to wildlife. Impacts which are judged to be significant must be addressed through mitigation measures, set out in required management plans and through adherence to Provincial regulations for fish health, escape prevention, sea lice monitoring and waste discharge. The CEAA screening also considers the cumulative effects of other projects in the same area and only those projects that are unlikely to cause significant adverse environmental effects (post mitigation) are allowed to proceed. The goal, principles, and objectives of the Wild Salmon Policy will guide the regulatory actions of the Department. Aquaculture operations will be regulated in a manner consistent with other human activities that may adversely affect salmon or their habitat and DFO will continue to invest in research to improve our understanding and management of this industry.\n22DFO (2002a), Aquaculture Policy Framework.\n\f32 Wild Salmon Policy\nWSP Implications: Science, Including Stock Assessment\n• Scientific programs will be\nrefocused to complement changes to fisheries management, the immediate need being identification and documentation of Conservation Units and benchmarks for each Pacific salmon species.\n• Stock assessment programs will build on existing monitoring programs to assess wild salmon at appropriate geographic scales.\n• Refocused programs will emphasize\nassessing the status of CUs, understanding changes to productivity and distribution, and developing risk assessment and management tools to guide decision-making.\n• DFO scientists will work with habitat and fishery managers to develop approaches to integrate ecosystem considerations into assessment and management.\n• Co-management will be promoted\nwith First Nations, and more partnerships will be necessary with public and private groups to collect required data, given the expanded monitoring needs and constraints on available funding.\nS T R AT E G Y 5 A N N UA L P RO G R A M D E L I V E RY\nA strategic plan gives a longer-term context for annual operational and business planning cycles. The strategic plan described in Strategy 4 will establish overall objectives and the various approaches that will be followed to achieve them. It will be left to annual operating plans to detail the specific short-term actions that actually implement the long-term strategy. Annual plans will identify the particular activities to be undertaken, the short-term operational targets for these activities, and the linkages to longer-term goals and objectives.\nAction Step 5.1. Assess the status of Conservation Units and populations Under this policy, DFO will assume a leadership role in partnerships to develop monitoring programs and assessments of wild salmon. Assessment will include field activities, which will build on existing programs as much as possible, and detailed stock assessments, which will identify the reasons for changes in status. Annual priorities for detailed assessments will be determined through PSARC, and documents prepared by Departmental staff and technical experts in other organizations involved with a CU, particularly the First Nations. The assessment of CUs will be staged over time, cost-effectively using a range of approaches. CU status will influence the frequency and detailed assessments but monitoring of abundance and distribution of salmon in CUs must be an annual commitment to protect the information basis for all decisions.\nStock assessment work plans describing the assessment plan for each CU and related activities (e.g., research or habitat activities) will be updated annually for each region (e.g., North Coast, Yukon). They will be reported as part of a database that describes for each region major risk factors and changes to these factors, assessment strategies within the region, resource management objectives, enhancement activities, and benchmarks. DFO will also commit to providing an open database of information on catch and spawning escapement, with links to the habitat integrated data system, so that threats or impacts can be identified and monitored.\nAction Step 5.2. Plan and conduct annual fisheries The specific annual fisheries management measures required by the management strategies selected under Strategy 4 will be identified and documented in annual Integrated Fishery Management Plans. These plans will include arrangements for food, social and ceremonial and treaty fisheries by First Nations and selective harvesting and other regulatory measures that will be put in place, such as bag and possession limits and anticipated open and close times.\nAnother key element of annual fisheries planning will be the development of explicit agreed-upon rules for in-season decision-making. The uncertainties and variations in fish availability associated with natural\n(cid:228) (cid:228) \fWild Salmon Policy\n33\nWSP Implications: Harvest Management\n• Harvest management will focus on\nthe conservation of CUs.\n• The practical implications of this change for harvest management will depend greatly on the extent to which the CUs identified under this policy differ from the salmon runs currently targeted by the different fisheries.This, in turn, will vary among salmon species.\n• There will likely be relatively few impacts on the management of chum and pink salmon, as these fisheries currently target smaller population components than may be identified as CUs.\n• More substantial impacts can be expected for the management of coho and chinook salmon, as the number of CUs will likely increase marginally from present management aggregates.\n• Impacts on sockeye management will be significant, since these fisheries target runs that often encompass numerous CUs.\n• The WSP will not preclude fisheries operating on population aggregates that include numerous CUs, but increased attention to all of the units within the aggregate will likely require significant changes to current management practices.\nsurvival and the imprecision of in-season management cannot be eliminated, but they can be better accounted for. Management plans will incorporate estimates of uncertainty and provide an adequate degree of confidence that management objectives will be met. The management responses to be taken in different circumstances will be more transparently identified and documented in advance of the fishing season. Important input on these decision rules will be sought from First Nations and the Integrated Salmon Harvest Planning Committee.\nAction Step 5.3. Plan and implement annual habitat management activities Habitat program work will shift from being largely reactive, to being planned and strategically directed in order to protect habitat and to implement management measures that meet the long term objectives specified by Strategic Plans (Strategy 4).\nStrategy two will identify habitats that underpin achievement of overall objectives for Conservation Units. These will include habitats that are intact and require protection or habitats that are degraded and require restoration or rehabilitation. Annual workplans will specify priorities for habitat rehabilitation or restoration work that will be undertaken by DFO or by DFO in partnership with others, and investigative work that may be undertaken to fill knowledge gaps. Plans will also recognize the need for protection of the key habitats identified in Strategy 2 using tools appropriate to the circumstances. Planning for restoration and habitat improvement will incorporate projects conducted by First Nations, volunteers and stakeholders and make use of more accessible data from a variety of sources. On an annual basis, a report on regulatory functions related to key habitats and restoration and rehabilitation works will be prepared. Habitat assessment and monitoring will feed back into the Habitat Management Program to evaluate measures for habitat protection and compliance, and to guide future program improvements. This new strategic approach to program delivery should ensure that fish habitat protection objectives are better integrated with fish management objectives at the CU level, leading to improved habitat protection.\nAction Step 5.4. Plan and implement annual enhancement activities The long-term objectives for enhancement projects will be set as part of a planning or recovery process for a Conservation Unit. Enhancement programs will last more than a year, but annual production targets and strategies will be documented in IFMP’s and will be consistent with objectives for CUs. Adult salmon production will be assessed for adherence to the rebuilding schedule and enhancement guidelines and practices. Priority projects will target CUs in the Red or Amber zone, where enhancement has been identified as a contributor to rebuilding. Secondary priority will be given to CUs where enhancement has been identified in planning processes as a means to maintain or develop fisheries.\n(cid:228) (cid:228) \f34 Wild Salmon Policy\nWSP Implications: Habitat Management\n• The Habitat Management Program\nwill change to better link watershed protection and stewardship initiatives with fish production objectives by integrating habitat monitoring, assessment, and program planning at the CU scale.\n• Habitat condition will be assessed\nthrough the development of indicators and benchmarks, and monitoring will be conducted to identify changes in habitat status over time and assess the effectiveness of regulatory interventions.\n• An integrated data system for the collection and dissemination of information on fish habitat status will be supported through improved access between existing systems.\n• These new approaches will\ncomplement existing efforts to modernize the national Habitat Management Program, aimed at moving from a focus on single regulatory strategy to a more balanced approach with greater emphasis on program planning, stewardship, and monitoring the success of habitat management in sustaining fish production.\n• If specific Conservation Units of wild salmon are threatened by development proposals or other human activities, corrective actions will be taken under Section 35 (fish habitat) of the Fisheries Act, or longer-term solutions will be pursued as part of integrated planning processes.\nS T R AT E G Y 6 PE R F O R M A N C E R EV I EW\nA performance review determines what is and is not working to encourage continuous improvement over time. Performance review under the Wild Salmon Policy will borrow heavily from procedures that are being adopted more generally in fisheries management planning throughout Canada. These procedures involve two levels of evaluation that can provide comprehensive guidance on changes required over time. Action Step 6.1 provides annual feedback on the implementation of measures taken as part of annual plans specified for fisheries, habitat, enhancement and assessment. Further, it evaluates whether adequate progress is being made to achieve the objectives defined in the strategic plan for the CU. Action Step 6.2 provides for periodic reviews of the overall success of the WSP in meeting its goal and objectives.\nAction Step 6.1 Conduct post-season review of annual workplans The Department in consultation with First Nations and others will conduct annual post-season reviews of work plan implementation for stock assessment, fishing, habitat, and enhancement that will provide the following:\n• Evaluation of annual plan implementation. For example, if an annual fishing plan calls for a substantial reduction in fishing time, or an annual enhancement work plan calls for certain fry release levels in a given year, it is important to know whether these events took place. • Evaluation of annual operational targets. For example, the operational targets may be exploitation rates in certain fisheries and lineal metres of habitat rehabilitation, both intended to increase the number of spawners. An evaluation will consider whether annual operational targets were achieved and whether they were effective in meeting the intent of the Strategic Plan.\n• Recommendations for adjustments for the next season.\nAction Step 6.2. Conduct regular reviews of the success of the WSP An independent review of the success of the WSP in achieving its broad goals and objectives will be conducted within 5 years of its adoption. On the basis of the review, the implementation of the policy will be revised to address shortcomings that may be reducing its effectiveness.\n(cid:228) (cid:228) \fWild Salmon Policy\n35\nWSP Implications: Species at Risk\n• The WSP will facilitate taking\nmanagement actions in advance of biological listing under COSEWIC and legal listing under the Species at Risk Act.\n• This will directly contribute to meeting DFO’s legal obligations under SARA, by helping to prevent aquatic species from being extirpated or becoming extinct.\n• Proactive responses in advance of listing will help to manage and reduce any adverse social and economic impacts that might arise from conservation actions required under a SARA listing.\nI M P L E M E N TAT I O N “ M a k i n g i t a l l Wo r k”\nThe adoption of a wild salmon policy is an important, long-awaited objective, but not an end in itself. Once it is adopted, attention must shift to implementation. The WSP requires acceptance of new ways of doing business and introduces a number of new program obligations. To ensure its commitments are met, an implementation plan will be prepared after the policy’s finalization. This plan will stipulate what tasks are required, how they will be performed, and when they will be completed. On completion, the plan will constitute the Department’s commitment to meeting its responsibilities for salmon conservation.\nThe six strategies proposed in the WSP represent a set of mutually dependent activities that must work together for the policy’s goal and objectives to be achieved. Since the individual strategies are not autonomous, successful implementation of each one of them is necessary to ensure the overall success of salmon resource management.\nThis new approach to salmon conservation is complex, and the pace and effectiveness of implementation will be influenced by two key factors. First, implementation must be accomplished within DFO’s existing resource capability and will be phased in over time. Second, it will depend on the effectiveness of our sharing of responsibilities with First Nations Governments, volunteers, stakeholders and other Governments.\nFull implementation will not be achieved overnight. Establishing the management and consultation process, and allowing it to mature, will take time. The completion of scientific work to define Conservation Units,\n\f36 Wild Salmon Policy\nWSP Implications: Aquaculture\n• Aquaculture operations will be\nregulated in a manner consistent with other human activities that may adversely affect salmon or their habitat.\n• If specific Conservation Units of wild salmon are threatened by aquaculture operations, corrective actions will be taken under the Fisheries Act, or longer-term solutions will be pursued as part of an integrated planning process.\nWSP Implications: Salmonid Enhancement Program\n• The enhancement program will\ncontinue to evolve towards greater emphasis on community stewardship, habitat restoration, and rebuilding of priority CUs.\n• Enhancement may be used to\nprovide harvest opportunities and fishery benefits as part of an integrated strategic plan.\n• The risks of hatchery production to wild salmon will be assessed through the development of a biological risk assessment framework.\nestablish benchmarks, and design new assessment systems will depend on the availability of data and scientific capacity. In addition, the policy introduces new challenges for the conduct of ongoing programs, and ultimate success depends on effective delivery of the Department’s research, enforcement, and Aboriginal programs. All of these activities, ongoing and new, must be accomplished within the envelope of available funding. Accordingly, it must be emphasized that complete implementation will not be achieved instantaneously, but will be phased in gradually.\nThere is a second requirement for successful policy implementation. The Department must adopt better partnerships with First Nations Governments, volunteers, stakeholders and other levels of Government and share responsibility and accountability for program delivery. It is clear that DFO cannot and should not attempt to do it all. No matter how strong our commitment to implementing the WSP, success will demand better collaboration with all of the groups and individuals having an interest in wild Pacific salmon. All have important roles to play in achieving sustainable management of wild salmon and their habitat. These groups monitor and report catches, protect and restore habitat, and carry out biological assessment work. Too often, this work is not integrated effectively with Departmental activities, which can diminish its value or simply result in wasted effort and funds. More collaboration is required to develop data standards, agree on methodologies, and share responsibility if we are to get the full benefit from the financial and human resources that are collectively dedicated to salmon stewardship. Improved cooperation with partners will be an important ingredient for future success. The more transparent process for decision-making underlying this policy will ensure that we are better equipped to achieve this important outcome.\n\fWild Salmon Policy\n37\nC O N C L U S I O N\nThe Wild Salmon Policy will transform our approach to managing Pacific salmon, their habitat, and dependent ecosystems. It is intended to foster a more robust resource that supports sustainable fisheries and recognizes the intrinsic value of salmon to society and to ecosystem functioning. Key elements of the policy recognize that:\n\nProtection of the genetic and geographic diversity of salmon is a prerequisite to their future evolutionary adaptation and long-term well-being.\nHabitat requires effective protection and rehabilitation if salmon\n\nare to prosper.\n\nEcosystem integrity needs to be considered in management decision-making to foster the conservation of salmon in an increasingly uncertain future.\nManagement must be based on good scientific information and\n\nconsider biological, social, and economic consequences.\n\nDecisions have to be made using open and accountable public\n\nprocesses so that they reflect society’s values.\nThe goal, objectives, principles, and strategies that underpin the WSP represent a new way of doing business. Moving ahead will require a redirection of the Department’s energy and resources, along with a commitment to embrace and advance new practices. Success will also require the cooperation of all who have an interest in the conservation of Pacific salmon. We are confident that making these changes is a wise investment that will yield a brighter future for salmon and the Canadians who enjoy them.\n\f38 Wild Salmon Policy\nG LO S S A RY\nAboriginal Traditional Knowledge (ATK). Includes, but is not limited to, the knowledge Aboriginal peoples have accumulated about wildlife species and their environment. Much of this knowledge has accumulated over many generations.\nAquaculture. The farming of aquatic organisms in the marine environment or freshwater.\nBiodiversity or biological diversity. The full range of variety and variability within and among living organisms and the ecological complexes in which they occur; and encompasses diversity at the ecosystem, community, species, and genetic levels and the interaction of these components.\nBroodstock. Mature salmon from which milt and roe are extracted to produce the next generation of cultivated fish.\nConservation. The protection, maintenance, and rehabilitation of genetic diversity, species, and ecosystems to sustain biodiversity and the continuance of evolutionary and natural production processes.23\nConservation Unit (CU). A group of wild salmon sufficiently isolated from other groups that, if extirpated, is very unlikely to recolonize naturally within an acceptable timeframe.\nDeme. A group of salmon at a persistent spawning site or within a stream comprised of individuals that are likely to breed with each other (i.e., well mixed). A single population may include more than one deme.\nEcosystem. A community of organisms and their physical environment interacting as an ecological unit.\nEnhancement. The application of biological and technical knowledge and capabilities to increase the productivity of fish stocks. It may be achieved by altering habitat attributes (e.g., habitat restoration) or by using fish culture techniques (e.g., hatcheries, spawning channels). In the context of this policy, only salmon originating from hatcheries and managed spawning channels will be considered enhanced.\nEscapement. The number of mature salmon that pass through (or escape) fisheries and return to fresh water to spawn.\nExtirpation. The local extinction of a species.\nFish habitat. Spawning grounds and nursery, rearing, food supply, and migration areas on which fish depend directly or indirectly to carry out their life processes.\nFry. Salmon that have emerged from gravel, completed yolk absorption, remained in freshwater streams, and are less than a few months old.\nGenetic diversity. The variation at the level of individual genes, and provides a mechanism for populations to adapt to their ever-changing environment. It refers to the differences in genetic make-up between distinct species and to genetic variations within a single species.\n23For further details see Shuter et al. (1997), “Reply: Toward a definition of conservation principles for fisheries management;” Grumbine (1994), “What is ecosystem management?;” Mangel et al. (1996), “Conservation of wild living resources;” and Olver et al. (1995), “Toward a definition of conservation principles for fisheries management.”\n\fWild Salmon Policy\n39\nGeographic diversity. Spatial variability observed within a species. This variation may have a genetic basis and/or may reflect habitat and developmental differences expressed by the species.\nHabitat restoration. The treatment or cleanup of fish habitat that has been altered, disrupted, or degraded for the purpose of increasing its capability to sustain fish production.\nIndicator system (IS). Comprised of fish from one or more persistent spawning locations or populations (perhaps enhanced) that are assumed to be representative of some aspect of a Conservation Unit. An IS may be an index site or stream selected to detect annual changes in abundance and/or survival, or an extensive site or stream selected to monitor species distribution and general habitat status. The status of the surrounding CU is inferred, in part, by comparing measures of abundance gathered by monitoring the IS to benchmarks.\nIntegrated resource management (IRM). Can be defined as a way of using and managing the environment and natural resources to achieve sustainable development. Using an IRM approach means that environmental, social, and economic issues are considered, while finding ways for all uses to exist together with less conflict.\nManaged spawning channels. Spawning channels where the entry of spawners and spawning density is controlled.\nMaximum sustainable yield (MSY). The largest catch (yield) that can be taken on average from a population under existing environmental conditions. Catch will vary annually due to variation in a populations survival rate.\nPacific salmon. Salmon of the Pacific Ocean regions, of which there are currently eleven species recognized in the Genus Oncorhynchus. The five species addressed in this policy are sockeye (Oncorhynchus nerka), pink (O. gorbuscha), chum (O. keta), coho (O. kisutch) and chinook (O. tshawytscha). Also in BC are steelhead (O. mykiss) and cutthroat trout (O. clarki). The remaining species include the masu (Asian distribution, O. masou), Mexican golden trout (O. chrysogaster), apache trout (O. apache), and gila trout (O. gilae). These latter three species have limited distributions in the western U.S. and northern Mexico.\nPopulation. A group of interbreeding organisms that is relatively isolated (i.e. demographically uncoupled) from other such groups and is likely adapted to the local habitat.\nPrecautionary approach. When used in an advisory context in support of decision-making by the Government of Canada, this term conveys the sense that the advice is provided in situations of high scientific uncertainty. It is intended to promote actions that would result in a low probability of harm that is serious or difficult to reverse.\nProductive capacity. The maximum natural capability of habitats to produce healthy fish, safe for human consumption, or to support or produce aquatic organisms on which fish depend.\nResource management. Departmental actions, policies and programs affecting wild Pacific salmon directly or indirectly through their habitats and ecosystems.\nRiparian zone and functions. The area of vegetation near streams is known as the riparian zone. Riparian function includes the interaction of hydrologic, geomorphic, and biotic processes within the riparian environment that determine the character of the riparian zone and the influences exerted on the adjacent aquatic and terrestrial environments (e.g., temperature controls, shading, large woody debris).\nSalmonid. A group of fish that includes salmon, trout, and char, belonging to the taxonomic Family Salmonidae.\n\f40 Wild Salmon Policy\nSelective harvesting. A conservation-based management approach that allows for the harvest of surplus target species or Conservation Units while aiming to minimize or avoid the harvest of species or stocks of conservation concern, or to release bycatch unharmed.\nSmolt. A juvenile salmon that has completed rearing in freshwater and migrates into the marine environment. A smolt becomes physiologically capable of balancing salt and water in the estuary and ocean waters. Smolts vary in size and age depending on the species of salmon.\nSpecies. The fundamental category of taxonomic classification consisting of organisms grouped by virtue of their common attributes and capable of interbreeding. A taxonomic species is equivalent to the term “species” but the phrase may be used to indicate the collective species throughout its distribution.\nStewardship. Acting responsibly to conserve fish and their habitat for present and future generations.\nStock assessment. The use of various statistical and mathematical calculations to make quantitative predictions about the reactions of fish populations to alternative management choices.\nStraying. The migration of a mature salmon into a stream other than that in which it was born (i.e., its “home” stream). Straying is not equivalent to gene flow (the exchange of genetic material) unless the straying fish successfully reproduces in the receiving stream.\nSustainable Development. Development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.24\nSustainable Use and Benefit. The use of resources in a way and at a rate that does not lead to their long-term decline, thereby maintaining the potential for future generations to meet their needs and aspirations. Sustainable use refers to consumptive uses of biological resources.25 Sustainable benefits, on the other hand, derive from a broader range of consumptive and non-consumptive resource uses.\nWatershed-based Fish Sustainability Planning (WFSP). A new approach to the management of fish stocks and fish habitat in British Columbia. Its overall goal is to ensure effective long-term conservation of fish and fish habitat – including spawning grounds and nursery, rearing, food supply, and migration areas on which fish depend directly or indirectly. WFSP is based on a standard planning sequence that can be applied to regions and watersheds across the province.26\nWild salmon. Salmon are considered “wild” if they have spent their entire life cycle in the wild and originate from parents that were also produced by natural spawning and continuously lived in the wild.\n24Brundtland (1987), Our Common Future: The World Commission on Environment and Development.\n25Environment Canada (1995), Canadian Biodiversity Strategy: Canada’s Response to the Convention on Biological Diversity.\n26See www-heb.pac.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/publications/pdf/sustainability_planning_e.pdf .\n\fWild Salmon Policy\n41\nA P PE N D I X 1 : L E G A L A N D P O L I C Y B AC KG RO U N D\nDFO exercises the following mandate with respect to fisheries and other responsibilities:\n“Fisheries and Oceans Canada is responsible for policies and programs in support of Canada’s economic, ecological and scientific interests in oceans and inland waters; for the conservation and sustainable utilization of Canada’s fisheries resources in marine and inland waters; for leading and facilitating federal policies and program on oceans; and for safe effective and environmentally sound marine services responsive to the needs of Canadians in a global economy.” 27\nThis appendix outlines some of the key legislation, national and international agreements, and programs and policies with particular implications for the conservation and management of Pacific salmon.\nLegislation\nThe Fisheries Act is the primary legislative basis for fisheries management in Canada. It authorizes the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans to make decisions about the conservation of fisheries resources and habitat, to establish and enforce standards for conservation, and to determine access to and allocation of the resource. Sections 35 (prohibiting the harmful alternation, disruption, and destruction, or HADD, of fish habitat) and 36 (prohibiting the deposit of deleterious substances into waters frequented by fish) confer strong powers to protect fish habitat. The Fisheries Development Act of 1985 further authorizes the Minister to undertake projects and develop partnerships to improve or develop commercial fisheries.\nThe Canadian Environmental Assessment Act (CEAA) came into force in 1995 and was updated through amendments in November 2003. Federal agencies must conduct environmental assessments of development proposals requiring decisions under federal legislation (e.g., decisions under section 35 of the Fisheries Act or prior to issuing permits under the Navigable Waters Protection Act or the National Energy Board Act). The CEAA process requires the advice of relevant federal agencies to assess significant environmental effects in the planning of a project. Smaller and routine projects typically undergo a “screening” assessment, while larger and environmentally sensitive projects undergo a more intensive “comprehensive study”.\nIn 1997, the Ocean’s Act extended the Department’s role in managing the use of marine resources and habitats. It called for the development of a national oceans management strategy guided by the principles of sustainable development, integrated management and an ecosystem perspective. Integrated management is a collaborative approach to decision-making that aims to balance the various interests in the marine and coastal environment, while incorporating conservation requirements. Ecosystem-based fisheries management considers the interactions between species and their environment, as well as the impact of fishing on the ecosystem. Canada’s Oceans Strategy 28 released in 2002 defines an oceans-centred planning framework that combines these principles. The Species at Risk Act (SARA) was proclaimed in June 2003, fulfilling a key national commitment under the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity (see below). As one of two federal departments charged with SARA’s implementation, DFO is responsible for protecting aquatic species at risk and their habitat. This responsibility includes the legal requirements to implement automatic prohibitions, develop recovery and action plans, plan and implement critical habitat protection, and conduct consultations within specified timelines.\nGuidance from the Courts Regarding Aboriginal Fishing Issues\nDFO seeks to manage fisheries, including Aboriginal fisheries, in a manner consistent with R. v. Sparrow and subsequent decisions of the courts.\n27DFO (2001a), Building Awareness and Capacity: An Action Plan for Continued Sustainable Development 2001–2003.\n28DFO (2002b), Canada’s Oceans Strategy: Our Oceans, Our Future.\n(cid:228) (cid:228) \f42 Wild Salmon Policy\nAs the Supreme Court of Canada stated in its 1996 decision in R. v. Van der Peet, an Aboriginal right is a practice, custom or tradition that was integral to the distinctive culture of an Aboriginal group at the time of contact between that group and Europeans. Accordingly, Aboriginal rights, by their very nature, have existed for a very long time. Rights under “historic treaties”, such as the Douglas Treaties, have also existed for a very long time in Canada. The only “modern treaty” in BC is the Nisga’a Final Agreement that applies to part of the northwestern part of BC. Other modern treaties are under negotiation in the British Columbia Treaty Commission process.\nAlthough Aboriginal and treaty rights have existed in Canada for a very long time, those rights were not protected by the Constitution of Canada until 1982. In that year, section 35 was added to the Constitution. Section 35 states that existing Aboriginal and treaty rights are “recognized and affirmed”.\nStarting with its 1990 decision in R. v. Sparrow, the Supreme Court of Canada has described a framework for the analysis of Aboriginal and treaty rights issues. The first step in the analysis is to determine whether an Aboriginal or treaty right can be established. If a right is established, the next step is to determine whether it has been infringed. If the right has been infringed, the court will consider whether the infringement can be justified. Courts continue to emphasize that analysis of Aboriginal and treaty rights issues must be done on a case by case basis.\nWith respect to the establishment of Aboriginal rights, the most important decision to date is the 1996 decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Van der Peet. The Court held in that decision that an Aboriginal right is a practice, custom or tradition that was integral to the distinctive culture of an Aboriginal group claiming the right at the time of contact between that group and Europeans. In its 1997 decision in Delgamuukw v. BC, the Supreme Court of Canada clarified that Aboriginal title, i.e., a right of exclusive use and occupation, is a type of Aboriginal right and set out the test for establishing Aboriginal title.\nIn its decision in R. v. Sparrow, the Supreme Court of Canada held that the following factors should be considered in assessing whether or not a limitation (such as an action or decision) infringes an Aboriginal or treaty right:\n• Does the limitation impose “undue hardship”? • Is the limitation unreasonable? • Does the limitation deny the holder of the right the “preferred means” of exercising the right?\nIf an Aboriginal group establishes a right, and that it has been infringed, the onus shifts to the Crown to justify the infringement. In R. v. Sparrow, the Supreme Court of Canada stated that “federal power must be reconciled with federal duty and the best way to achieve that reconciliation is to demand the justification of any government regulation that infringes upon or denies aboriginal rights”.\nWith respect to justifying infringements of rights to fish for food, social and ceremonial purposes, the\nSupreme Court of Canada held in R. v. Sparrow that the following factors should be considered:\n\nIs there a “valid legislative objective” (e.g., conservation)?\nHas the honour of the Crown been upheld?\n\n– Priority after conservation? – Adequate consultation? – As little infringement as possible? – Fair compensation (in a “situation of expropriation”)?\nIn its decision in R. v. Sparrow, the Supreme Court of Canada described a “valid legislative objective” as follows: “An objective aimed at preserving s. 35(1) rights by conserving and managing a natural resource, for example, would be valid. Also valid would be objectives purporting to prevent the exercise of s. 35(1) rights that would cause harm to the general populace or to aboriginal peoples themselves, or other objectives found to be compelling and substantial.” In its 1996 decision in R. v. Nikal, the Court acknowledged that “conservation” can include measures to reasonably increase fish stocks.\nIn its 1995 decisions in R. v. Jack, John and John, R. v. Sampson and Elliot, and R. v. Little (sometimes referred to as the “interception cases”), the BC Court of Appeal considered situations in which fish were harvested in mixed\n\fWild Salmon Policy\n43\nstock interception fisheries while Aboriginal fisheries in terminal areas were limited. In its decision in R. v. Sampson and Elliot, the Court provided the following guidance: “We do not suggest that the DFO should prohibit all commercial and recreational fishing in the area of the interception fishery in Johnstone Strait. However, it is the responsibility of the DFO to implement a system which will conform to the priorities set forth in Sparrow.”\nIn all of the decisions in which the issue of priority has been considered, courts have carefully assessed the often complex facts relating to the how the Aboriginal, commercial and recreational fisheries were managed in the circumstances. It is clear that consideration of the issue of priority will always involve a detailed “case by case” analysis of the relevant facts.\nWith respect to consultation issues, significant guidance was provided by the Supreme Court of Canada in late 2004 in its decision in Haida v. BC. In that decision, the Court ruled that the Crown has a legal duty to consult with First Nations and, depending on the strength of the claim of Aboriginal rights or Aboriginal title and the seriousness of the potential adverse effect of a decision on the claimed rights or title, accommodate their interests when the Crown has knowledge of the potential existence of an Aboriginal right or Aboriginal title and is making decisions that might adversely affect the right or title. The Court held that scope of the duty will vary depending on the circumstances, including the strength of a First Nation’s claim respecting the Aboriginal right or Aboriginal title and the potential impact of the government’s decision on the claimed right or title. It is significant that, in its decision in Haida v. BC, the Supreme Court of Canada held that the Crown’s legal duty to consult with an Aboriginal group can arise even before the group establishes any Aboriginal rights or Aboriginal title.\nAgreements\nIn 1985, Canada and the United States signed the Pacific Salmon Treaty requiring the conduct of fisheries so as to provide for optimum production and equitable exploitation of salmon stocks. Under the Treaty, each party is to receive benefits equivalent to the production of salmon originating in its waters, and each is to avoid undue disruption to the other’s fisheries. Bilateral agreements must be periodically developed to implement the Treaty’s principles for long-term conservation and harvest sharing. In addition, the Pacific Salmon Commission was established to advise both countries on the implementation of Treaty provisions.\nCanada was the first industrialized nation to ratify the UN Convention on Biological Diversity signed by more than 150 countries at the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. The Convention has three main goals: (1) the conservation of biodiversity; (2) sustainable use of the components of biodiversity; and (3) fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the commercial and other use of genetic resources. In terms of defining at what level biodiversity should be conserved, it advocates the conservation of genes, species and ecosystems, without providing guidance on which one should receive priority.\nIn 1996, the federal, Provincial and Territorial governments signed the Accord for the Protection of Species at Risk in Canada. Under this agreement, the Canadian Endangered Species Conservation Council was created to determine responses to assessments made by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC), the independent body of scientists responsible for designating the status of species.\nAfter years of dispute over the conservation and harvest provisions of the Pacific Salmon Treaty, Canada and the US signed the Pacific Salmon Agreement in 1999. This agreement established abundance-based fishing regimes for the salmon fisheries under its jurisdiction. Two bilaterally managed regional funds were created to promote cooperation, improve fisheries management, and assist salmon and habitat enhancement efforts. The Agreement also included a commitment by the two countries to improve how scientific information is obtained, shared and applied to salmon management decisions.\nThe North Pacific Anadromous Fish Commission (NPAFC) was established by the Convention for the Conservation of Anadromous Stocks in the North Pacific Ocean (the Convention) which became effective in 1993. The NPAFC includes Canada, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Russia, and the U.S., the primary states of origin for salmon stocks in the North Pacific. The Convention prohibits directed fishing for salmonids on the high seas of the North Pacific and includes provisions to minimize the number of salmonids taken in\n(cid:228) \f44 Wild Salmon Policy\nother fisheries. The NPAFC promotes the conservation of salmonids in the North Pacific and its adjacent seas and serves as a venue for cooperation in and coordination of enforcement activities and scientific research.\nOn May 29, 1993, Yukon First Nations, Canada and Yukon signed the “Umbrella Final Agreement” under which treaties with individual Yukon First Nations would be negotiated. Since then, a number of such treaties (the “Yukon Final Agreements”) have been entered into between individual Yukon First Nations, Canada and Yukon. Some of the provisions of those treaties apply to the management of wild Pacific salmon.\nThe Nisga’a Final Agreement, the first “modern” treaty in British Columbia, took effect on May 11, 2000 after ratification of the Final Agreement by the Nisga’a Nation and the enactment of federal and Provincial settlement legislation. The Nisga’a Final Agreement applies to the management of salmon originating in the Nass Area, as defined in the Final Agreement. Other “modern” treaties are being negotiated between First Nations, Canada and British Columbia in the British Columbia Treaty Commission process.\nPolicies and Programs\nIn 1986, DFO introduced the Policy for the Management of Fish Habitat 29 to provide guidance to Departmental staff, developers and the public on habitat conservation, restoration and development. The policy’s overall objective is a net gain in the productive capacity of fish habitat, using the guiding principle of “no net loss” to ensure that habitat is conserved.\nThe Aboriginal Fisheries Strategy (AFS) was launched in 1992 in response to the Supreme Court of Canada’s Sparrow decision on the Aboriginal food fishery.30 The AFS program is applicable where DFO manages the fishery and where land claims settlements have not already put a fisheries management regime in place. It seeks to provide for the effective management and regulation of fishing by Aboriginal communities through negotiation of mutually acceptable and time-limited agreements between the Department and Aboriginal groups.\nIn 1998, A New Direction for Canada’s Pacific Salmon Fisheries 31 established conservation as the primary objective for managing the wild salmon resource. The new policy set out 12 broad principles in the areas of conservation, sustainable use and improved decision-making. It stated that conservation should take precedence over other uses and that a precautionary approach to fisheries management should be adopted.\nNew Directions called for more detailed policies to put its principles into operation. An Allocation Policy for Pacific Salmon 32 confirmed the precedence of conservation and described a balanced allocation among the commercial, recreational and aboriginal fisheries once conservation requirements have been met. A Policy for Selective Fishing in Canada’s Pacific Fisheries 33 outlined principles and an implementation framework for selective harvest practices, as part of a long-term conservation and sustainable use strategy. For improved decision-making, there is work underway to create stakeholder committees that will help develop salmon harvest plans, as well as a formal public policy advisory process.\nThe Aboriginal Aquatic Resource and Oceans Management Program (AAROM) announced in October 2003 will help Aboriginal groups acquire expertise to participate more effectively in processes for aquatic resources and oceans management.34 A major objective of AAROM is to provide these groups with the capacity to contribute to technical and advisory committees in areas of DFO responsibility, including fisheries and habitat management and oceans planning and management.\n29DFO (1986), Policy for the Management of Fish Habitat.\n30See www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/communic/fish_man/afs_e.htm .\n31DFO (1998), A New Direction for Canada’s Pacific Salmon Fisheries.\n32DFO (1999), An Allocation Policy for Pacific Salmon.\n33DFO (2001b), A Policy for Selective Fishing in Canada’s Pacific Fisheries.\n34See www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/media/backgrou/2003/hq-ac99a_e.htm .\n(cid:228) \fWild Salmon Policy\n45\nA P PE N D I X 2 . A S T RU C T U R E D F I V E - S T E P P L A N N I N G P RO C E D U R E\nDeveloping integrated strategic plans for individual CUs and groups of CUs will need extensive detailed information on the status of wild salmon, their habitat and ecosystem to be brought together and collated with information on fisheries and watershed activities. In addition, broad based input on possible management actions and their potential impacts will need to be received, considered and discussed in an organised way to arrive at reasoned and informed management decisions. The range of information that will need to be processed and the complex and sometimes controversial nature of the issues involved calls for a formal, structured and open procedure to be used in developing strategic plans.\nThe five-step planning procedure outlined below is proposed in this policy to assist in strategic planning. This procedure breaks down decision-making into a logical and manageable sequence that reflects standard decision-making practices in many private and public agencies.35 In addition, it is designed to enhance integration and open up current salmon planning processes to greater public involvement. It provides for improved dialogue among the affected parties and enables them to participate throughout the development of plans from the establishment of planning priorities to the identification of management alternatives, their evaluation and the selection of a preferred management alternative.\nIn the longer term, the application of the planning procedure and the development of integrated salmon plans will be the primary responsibility of appropriate representative planning bodies within a new integrated planning structure (Action Step 4.2). In the interim, the Department will bring together First Nations and various interests from existing planning processes, as needed, to provide focused recommendations for conservation and re-building conservation units that are in low abundance (Action Step 4.1).\nStep 1 Identify planning priorities\nAs a starting point for planning, DFO staff will provide an overview report that identifies the CUs exploited by fisheries within each planning unit and gives summary information on their biological status (Red, Amber or Green). Key habitat and ecosystem constraints or threats to individual CUs will also be summarised by watershed. For CUs in the Red zone more detailed reports will also be provided as they become available. These detailed reports will consider and incorporate ATK, where available, and be subject to peer review through PSARC.\nBased on this information and their knowledge of local circumstances, First Nations and other participants in the planning process will be asked to develop key priorities for the each planning unit. These priorities will be established consistent with the WSP objectives and principles, and will include the re-building of CUs where these fall below their established lower benchmarks. However, priorities may also include rebuilding or enhancing returns of wild salmon where these are below their sustainable production potential, or maintaining harvest levels in First Nations or other fisheries.\nFor every planning unit, Step 1 will provide a list of specific key priorities that are to be addressed in the\ndevelopment of integrated salmon management plans.\nStep 2 Identify resource management options and alternative management strategies\nAt Step 2, several alternative management strategies will be developed in consultation with First Nations and other participants in the planning process. Specific management options proposed may include fisheries management measures such as fishing time and area restrictions or habitat restoration activities or watershed\n35See for example Schlenker-Goodrich (2003), A Conservationist’s Guide to BLM Planning and Decision-Making: Using FLPMA and NEPA to Protect Public Lands.\n(cid:228) (cid:228) \f46 Wild Salmon Policy\ndevelopment constraints or enhancement initiatives. At this stage in the planning process it will be important that no realistic management option is eliminated from consideration. The specific options identified through these consultations will be used either singly or in combination to develop two or more alternative strategies for addressing the management priorities for the planning unit.\nFor every planning unit, Step 2 will provide a number of alternative strategies that reflect a realistic range\nof different approaches to addressing the management priorities for each planning unit.\nStep 3 Establish biological, social, and economic performance indicators\nAt Step 3, input from First Nations and other participants in the planning process will be used to develop an evaluation framework for comparing the management alternatives developed in Step 2. This will require First Nations and others to identify explicit, measurable performance indicators applicable to the planning unit, its component CUs and their underlying local populations. These indicators should be suitable both to rate and rank the likely performance of each management alternative before making decisions, and to assess performance over time following decision-making and implementation. The indicators should directly relate to the biological objectives (safeguard the genetic diversity of wild salmon and maintain the integrity of their habitat and ecosystem) and the social and economic objectives (manage fisheries for sustainable benefits) of the WSP. To be useful, the indicators collectively will need to fully reflect the concerns and interests of First Nations and other participants in the planning process.\nFor each planning unit, Step 3 will provide a credible, broadly accepted management assessment\nframework that captures and reflects all significant biological, social, and economic considerations.\nStep 4 Assess the likely impacts of management alternatives\nAt Step 4, the alternative management strategies identified in Step 2 will be evaluated using the performance indicators developed in Step 3. The evaluation process will be forward-looking and focused on estimating the “future” impacts (both positive and negative) of each strategy on each of the indicators for the planning unit. These predictions will need to reflect the uncertainties and risks associated with each management alternative. Under the Wild Salmon Policy, DFO will play a lead role in providing or obtaining these predictions from appropriate technical experts. For some planning units, computer simulation models may be available to assist, but in other cases it will be necessary to rely on expert opinion. To facilitate comparison between management alternatives the likely “net effect” of each management alternative relative to a common base case (e.g. status quo management) on all of the selected indicators for the planning unit will be projected for appropriate time periods.\nStep 4 will provide a set of predicted outcomes for each alternative management strategy.\nStep 5 Select the preferred management alternative\nThe predicted outcomes from Step 4 will help in selecting a preferred management strategy. In many cases, tradeoffs will be apparent among different biological, social, and economic indicators. It is anticipated that differences of opinion will occur between individuals and interest groups about the “best” alternative because of their different priorities and tolerances to risks.\nThe goal will be to use constructive dialogue among First Nations and others involved in the planning process to resolve these differences, find compromise solutions and to develop consensus recommendations wherever possible for each planning unit. In the absence of consensus, differences of view will be fully\n(cid:228) (cid:228) (cid:228) \fWild Salmon Policy\n47\ndocumented to inform final decision-making. The Minister of Fisheries and Oceans will consider the input received and will make the final decisions. Records of all decisions will be made available to the public.\nThe decisions made for each planning unit will collectively form the regional strategic plan for the management of fisheries and watersheds. The plan will include activities and management actions to be undertaken over a medium- to long-term timeframe. It will also stipulate explicit biological targets to be achieved for individual Conservation Units and groups of CUs and, where appropriate, anticipated timeframes for rebuilding. All of this information will be documented in an Integrated Management Plan for Pacific salmon. One of the challenges in successfully managing wild salmon is to achieve consensus on how to address conservation concerns while accounting for the social and economic impacts of alternative management actions. In the planning process described here, the interested parties will be directly engaged throughout the development of management plans from the establishment of planning priorities through to the evaluation and selection of the preferred management alternative. The deliberations will be guided by the principles and objectives expressed the WSP, and the acceptability of the recommended management actions will be determined by the degree to which they advance the overall policy goal of restoring and maintaining healthy and diverse salmon populations for the benefit and enjoyment of the people of Canada in perpetuity.\n\f48 Wild Salmon Policy\nR E F E R E N C E S\nBritish Columbia Ministry of Water, Land and Air Protection. 2002.

    "text": "GUIDE TO THE WSP STATUS DASHBOARDS\nV4 2025-05-28\nIntroduction\nThe WSP status dashboards are a condensed summary of information to support the WSP rapid status process.. The dashboards have been effective once a Working Group has become comfortable with the WSP status assessment framework. This requires familiarity with the WSP- specific technical jargon, details of the established methods, and interpretation of the dashboard figures (Holt 2009; Holt et al. 2009; Pestal et al. 2023; DFO 2024).\nKey points:\n• WSP status assessments focus on 4 standard metrics: relative abundance, absolute\nabundance, long-term trend, and percent change.\n• Annual metric values are compared to metric-specific upper and lower benchmarks to\nassign a status category for each individual metric.\n• A decision tree (DFO 2024) is used to combine information across available metrics. The structure and threshold values of the decision tree are designed to capture the expert consensus from a series of previously completed status assessment workshops. Note that threshold values used in the decision tree do not always align with the metric benchmarks because they represent how the metrics are interpreted and applied by experts when determining statuses.\nThe dashboards show (1) details for the four standard metrics and their benchmarks, and (2) a summary of the annual status categories of the individual metrics and the annual WSP status results determined by the decision tree.\nFor more information refer to the following online resources:\n• The WSPMetrics R Package has functions to calculate the standard WSP metrics and apply\nthe status decision tree.\n• The WSP Rapid Status Worked Examples repository has a step-by-step implementation,\nshowing source data, metric specifications, R script to calculate the metrics and apply the decision tree, and resulting status dashboards. This repository also has a description of the decision tree and provides links to all of the technical documentation.\nFor question and feedback, please contact:\n• Sue Grant (Sue.Grant@dfo-mpo.gc.ca) • Gottfried Pestal (gottfried.pestal@solv.ca) • Bronwyn MacDonald (Bronwyn.MacDonald@dfo-mpo.gc.ca)\n1\nField Code Changed\n\fIdentifying Information: Species, CU Name, Stock Management Unit, Type of data (absolute abundance or relative index)\nParts of the Dashboard\nPanel 1 – Relative Abundance Metric Plot shows all available spawner estimates (blue) and the running generational average (red) compared to biological benchmarks (generally Sgen and 80% Smsy from SR model fits). Benchmarks for this metric are specific to each CU, reflecting its capacity and productivity. The relative abundance metric is calculated using the generational average (red line). The vertical dashed line marks the start of the retrospective evaluation – i.e. the start year for the metric statuses shown in the lower panel. Note that the year axis is the same for all CUs to facilitate comparisons. Earlier years are cut off in the display for a few CUs, but are used in the metric calculations\nPanel 3 – Long-term Trend Metric The plotted blue line shows the value of the long-term trend metric in each year, i.e. the ratio of the recent generational average to the long-term generational average. Benchmarks for this metric are standard across CUs. Long- term-trend is shown only for the retrospective evaluation years.\nMetric Summary: Summary of the annual metric status zones for the retrospective period (the first year matches the vertical dashed lines in the panels above). Status zones are determined using the same data and metric-specific benchmarks shown in the 4 panels above.\nStatus Summary (bottom 3 rows of the table): Results of applying the decision tree to the available metrics for each retrospective year. Results include a status designation (Red/Amber/Green) and a confidence rating (High/Moderate/Low) which reflects the type of information used to assign status (i.e., higher confidence is assigned to statuses that are determined using the abundance relative to biological benchmarks than to statuses that are assigned based solely on trends). Where available, the bottom row shows results from completed integrated status assessment workshops.\nPanel 2 - Absolute Abundance Metric. Plot shows all available spawner estimates (blue) and the running generational average (red). This is the same data shown in panel 1, but (1) it is being plotted on a log-scale to highlight low abundance years, and (2) it is being compared to different benchmarks, i.e. the absolute abundance benchmarks. The generational average (red line) is used to calculate this metric. Benchmarks for this metric are standard across CUs, regardless of species or life history type, but the metric is only used if estimates of total spawner abundance are available, as determined by CU experts. The vertical dashed line marks the start of the retrospective evaluation - i.e. the start year for the metric statuses shown in the lower panel.\nPanel 4 – Percent Change Metric The plotted blue line shows the value of the percent change metric in each year, i.e. the percent change over 3 generations (slope). This metric is also called the short-term trend. Depending on species, life- history, and data availability, data used to calculate the percent change metric may be log- transformed and/or smoothed. Benchmarks for this metric are standard across CUs. Percent change is shown only for the retrospective evaluation years.\n2\n\fSpecial Case: Reference Line Only\nThere are some instances where the relative abundance metric is not usable for a CU, but the expert review process identified CU-specific biological benchmarks that are considered interesting as contextual information. Examples include South Thompson Summer 1.3 Chinook and Middle Fraser Summer 1.3 Chinook.\nIn these cases, Panel 1 of the dashboard shows the spawner abundance time series (blue line) with dashed horizontal reference lines that indicate the CU-specific benchmarks. The panel is not shaded into corresponding status zones, the status of the relative abundance metric is not determined, and the relative abundance metric row of the metric summary is left blank. The relative abundance metric is not used to determine status in these cases.\nSpecial Case: Highly Cyclic CUs\nThe relative abundance metric is applied differently for highly cyclic CUs, following how this metric was interpreted and used in previously-completed status assessment workshops. Examples include Takla-Trembleur-Early Stuart Sockeye and Shuswap Late Sockeye. The relative abundance metric is determined using the most recent dominant cycle abundance in each year instead of the recent generational average. This is reflected in the Panel 1 plots for highly cyclic CUs, which highlight the dominant cycle years with a red circle and do not show the recent generational average.

Indicators of status and benchmarks\nfor conservation units in Canada’s Wild Salmon Policy. DFO Can. Sci. Advis. Sec. Res. Doc. 2009/058. viii + 74 p.\nABSTRACT\nThe goal of Canada’s Wild Salmon Policy (WSP) is to restore and maintain healthy and diverse salmon populations and their habitats for the benefit and enjoyment of the people of Canada in perpetuity. To achieve that goal, the WSP requires that biological status be assessed for all geographically, ecologically, and genetically distinct populations, or Conservation Units (CUs). One component of that assessment is identifying quantifiable metrics of biological status and benchmarks along those metrics. Here, we provide a toolkit of metrics and benchmarks of status, which will set the stage for future CU assessments. Specifically, we propose a multi-criteria approach for assessing status that uses information on current abundances, trends in abundance over time, distribution of spawners, and fishing mortality relative to stock productivity. That approach captures the multiple dimensions of population status that will be important to achieve WSP goals better than assessments based on abundances alone. Furthermore, any redundancy in information content among criteria may allow for increased flexibility when assessing stocks that differ widely in data quantity and quality. Here, we identify quantifiable metrics and candidate benchmarks drawn from the scientific literature and previous management experience. Using a simulation model, we further evaluate a subset of those benchmarks on two performance metrics: the probability of extirpation over the long term and the probability of recovery to a target. Finally, we apply those metrics and candidate benchmarks to two example CUs, Takla/Trembleur sockeye salmon (Early Stuart run-timing group of the Fraser River) and Hecate Strait Lowlands pink salmon (odd year).\nv\nRÉSUMÉ\nLe but de la Politique concernant le saumon sauvage (PSS) du Canada vise à rétablir et de maintenir la santé et la diversité des populations de saumon et de leurs habitats, pour le bénéfice et le plaisir durables des Canadiens et Canadiennes. Pour réaliser l’objectif de la PSS, on doit évaluer la situation biologique de toutes les populations, ou des unités de conservation (UC), distinctes du point de vue géographique, écologique et génétique. Un des volets de cette évaluation consiste à préciser des mesures quantifiables de la situation biologique et des repères correspondants. Nous offrons ici une boîte à outils de mesures et de repères de la situation qui définissent les balises des futures évaluations des UC. De façon plus précise, nous proposons une approche à plusieurs variables pour l’évaluation de la situation qui fait appel aux renseignements sur l’abondance actuelle, aux tendances de l’abondance au fil du temps, à la répartition des géniteurs et à la mortalité par pêche en lien avec la productivité des stocks. Cette approche tient compte des multiples dimensions de la situation de la population, importantes pour l’atteinte des buts de la PSS, mieux que ne le feraient des évaluations fondées seulement sur l’abondance. En outre, toute redondance dans le contenu de l’information des critères permettrait une plus grande souplesse dans l’évaluation des stocks pour lesquels les données diffèrent considérablement sur le plan de la quantité et de la qualité. Nous précisons ici des mesures quantifiables et des repères candidats fondés sur la documentation scientifique et les expériences de gestion antérieures. À l’aide d’un modèle de simulation, nous évaluons plus à fond un sous-ensemble de ces repères en fonction de deux mesures de rendement : la probabilité de disparition de l’espèce d’un endroit donné à long terme et la probabilité de rétablissement par rapport à un objectif. Enfin, nous appliquons ces mesures et ces repères candidats à deux UC témoins, le saumon rouge des lacs Takla et Trembleur (groupe de remontes précoces de la Stuart du fleuve Fraser) et le saumon rose des basses terres du détroit d’Hécate (année impaire).\nvi\n1. GLOSSARY\nBenchmark: synonymous with biological reference point. Biological Reference Point (BRP): a biological benchmark against which the attributes of a stock (e.g., abundance or fishing mortality rate) can be measured in order to determine its status. Conservation Unit (CU): a group of wild salmon sufficiently isolated from other groups that, if lost, is very unlikely to recolonize naturally within an acceptable time frame (e.g., a human lifetime or a specified number of salmon generations). COSEWIC: Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada. Depensatory mortality: mortality rate that increases as the size of the population decreases. Diversity (of salmon): the genetic variation and adaptations to different environments that have accumulated between populations of salmon (defined by the Wild Salmon Policy). Inbreeding depression: Mating or crossing of individuals more closely related than average pairs in a population resulting in reduced fitness of progeny. Lower benchmark: a reference point in biological status associated with significant losses in production between the Amber and Red zones, and which allows for a substantial buffer between it and any level of abundance that could lead to a CU being considered at risk of extinction by COSEWIC. Metric: a quantifiable measure. Production model: a quantitative representation of the production of recruits in one generation from spawners in the previous generation. Productivity: number of recruits produced per spawner. Risk: magnitude of a negative outcome weighted by its probability of occurrence. Risk tolerance: attitude toward uncertainties in the occurrence and/or magnitude of a negative outcome. Spatial structure: geographic relationship among spawning groups. Spawning group: a sub-population within a CU, analogous to a counting location. Upper benchmark: (or higher benchmark) a reference point in biological status associated with harvests at the level expected to provide, on an average annual basis, the maximum catch for a CU, given existing environmental conditions. Wild salmon: salmon that have spent their entire life cycle in the wild and originate from parents that were also produced by natural spawning and continuously lived in the wild.\nvii\nviii\n2.\nINTRODUCTION\n“The goal of the Wild Salmon Policy is to restore and maintain healthy and diverse salmon populations and their habitats for the benefit and enjoyment of the people of Canada in perpetuity.”\n~Wild Salmon Policy 2005\nTo achieve its goal, the Wild Salmon Policy (WSP) describes several strategies that will be adopted, the first of which is standardized monitoring of salmon status (Fisheries and Oceans Canada, 2005)(p.16-19). There are three action items under that strategy. The first item, the identification of Conservation Units (CU), has been completed (Holtby and Ciruna, 2007). The second action step requires the development of criteria to assess CUs and the identification of benchmarks to represent their biological status. The third action item is the actual determination of biological status for each CU. This document addresses the first part of the second item, namely, an examination of the criteria that are available for determining the status of a CU. Our overall goal is to provide a toolkit of metrics and benchmarks of biological status, which will set the stage for future assessments of CUs.\nIn the Introduction, we begin by attempting to clarify the bewildering terminology involved in any discussion of status. In Section 3, we outline quantifiable metrics for each class of indicators, candidate benchmarks drawn from the scientific literature and previous management experience, and a simulation model that evaluates performance of lower benchmarks on two criteria, probability of extirpation over the long term and probability of recovery to a target (see the Technical Documentation on the Evaluation of Benchmarks for Conservation Units in Canada’s Wild Salmon Policy (Holt, 2009)). Using the simulation model we also compare the performance of lower benchmarks under various changes in productivity (to evaluate, for example, how precautionary benchmarks are given uncertainty in future trends in productivity, as well as uncertainties in other components of the fisheries system). In Section 4, the metrics and candidate benchmarks are applied to two example CUs, Takla/Trembleur sockeye salmon (Early Stuart run-timing group of the Fraser River) and Hecate Strait Lowlands pink salmon (odd year). Those two examples were chosen to demonstrate CUs with high quality (Takla/Trembleur) and poor quality (Hecate Strait Lowlands) data. Furthermore, Takla/Trembleur is of immediate management concern because of recent poor recruitments. Our intentions are to demonstrate the methodology developed in the pervious sections, and not provide formal advice for those two CUs. We conclude with further steps required to assess status of CUs. As described in the WSP, benchmarks will “be determined on a case by case basis, depending on the species and types of information available” (p.18). Further work will be required to adapt these metrics and benchmarks to other CUs.\n2.1 A conceptual assessment framework\nWe often confuse state and status because a reference frame is usually implicitly understood. If we were to declare that the temperature in a room was +10°X then nobody could determine the status of that room in the reference frame of human temperature preferences. If we were to then reveal that °X is a scale using Centigrade degrees relative to a\n1\nnominal value of 22°C, we would know immediately that the status of the room temperature was hot but not intolerably so1. Revealing that the ambient noise level in the room was -45 dB(A) would indicate a quiet room but would not tell you whether there was enough light to read a book. In other words, to determine status one needs to specify a reference frame and a state variable and one or more benchmarks that are meaningful within the reference frame.\n2.2 Benchmarks and Biological Reference Points\nA biological reference point (BRP) is a benchmark against which an attribute of the stock (e.g., abundance) can be measured in order to determine its status (Caddy and Mahon, 1995). The two terms are used interchangeably in the fisheries literature, but, with the exception of this section, we use the term benchmark to be consistent with the Wild Salmon Policy. We use BRP only when referring to previous studies that used that term. Although reference points are often used to describe harvest rules (e.g., thresholds in abundances which trigger management actions), our description of benchmarks is intended describe zones of biological status only. Identifying harvest rules requires information on other habitat, ecological, and socio-economic factors not considered here (but included in Strategies 2, 3, and 4 of the Wild Salmon Policy, respectively).\nCaddy and Mahon (1995) observed that BRPs are of two types. One type, which they termed a Target Reference Point or TRP, indicates “a state of a fishery and/or resource that is considered to be desirable and at which management action, whether during development or stock rebuilding should aim” (ibid. p. 8). The other type was termed a Threshold or Limit Reference Point (LRP), and “indicates a state of a fishery and/or a resource which is considered to be undesirable and which management action should avoid” (ibid. p. 8). These definitions are of conceptual conditions or states of a resource or of a fishery, and must subsequently be quantified to provide measurable targets or thresholds. In addition to the LRP and TRP, a Precautionary Reference Point (PRP) has also been defined (ICES, 1996). The PRP recognizes that the LRP defines a state that should be avoided and that it would be precautionary to instigate fisheries management responses before that state is reached so as to avoid it.\nThe LRP can be regarded as a benchmark giving information about a state of the resource that should be avoided to ensure that stocks and their exploitation remain within safe biological limits. Defined in this way the LRP is not prescriptive in any way. However, FAO’s Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries (FAO, 1995) does link reference points to fisheries management actions as part of the Fisheries Precautionary Approach (ibid. p. 12-13). As the WSP makes abundantly clear, (e.g., p. 17) all sorts of considerations, of which stock state is just one, are made in managing fisheries. Consequently, the WSP benchmarks cannot be linked to any particular management action other than the very general ones of reducing or redirecting fisheries (ibid. p. 24) when it has been decided to reverse or stabilize a downward CU trajectory.\n1 Assuming that the person assessing status is familiar with °C, not old, in good health, and appropriately dressed.\n2\n2.3 Benchmarks and the role of Science\nThe proper role of Science is to determine the safe biological limit of the resource. That limit can be defined in a multitude of ways but, generally, it will be an abundance below which long-term average production would be compromised (a lower abundance on spawner abundances, or Slower benchmark). Such a threshold will be determined within a specified production model for the resource, will be made with a set of assumptions, and should, as far as is possible, be free of any implicit assumptions of acceptable or unacceptable risk. This last attribute requires some explanation. In applying the model, there are many uncertainties. For example, because all models approximate nature, we are often not certain which production model is most appropriate. The parameter values of our particular model and the data used to estimate them are often highly uncertain. Describing and quantifying uncertainties has become very important in the provision of advice, but deciding what to do about them is the role of fisheries management. Why this is so is illustrated in Figure 1.\n1 1\n0 0\nprecautionary SLBM precautionary SLBM\ndeterministic SLBM deterministic SLBM\nt t e e g g r r a a t t g g n n i i v v e e h h c c a a f f o o y y t t i i l l i i\ni i\nb b a a b b o o r r P P\nSlower benchmark Slower benchmark\nFigure 1. A hypothetical relationship between a lower benchmark (SLBM) and the probability of achieving a target within a specified time. The deterministic SLBM is the level of spawner abundance such that the target would be attained with certainty within the specified time following the particular management if there was no uncertainty,\n3\ni.e., perfect knowledge. The precautionary SLBM accounts for uncertainty in achieving the target.\nWith a specified target, management action(s), and time allowed to achieve the target, and perfect knowledge of the fisheries system, it is possible to calculate the minimum level of abundance from which the population can successfully recover2 (deterministic Slower benchmark, Figure 1). Under the assumption of perfect knowledge, it would be known with certainty that recovery could not be achieved if there were fewer fish. As various types of uncertainty are incorporated into the model, it is possible to generate a relationship between the value of S where the specified management action was initiated and the probability that the target would be achieved within the specified time (precautionary Slower benchmark, Figure 1). In addition to the model, the target, the allowable recovery time and all their associated uncertainties, the choice of a particular lower benchmark depends on the probability level assumed, i.e., the risk tolerance. Decisions about risk tolerance are largely political, although science should assist fisheries management in interpreting risk assessments (Hauge et al., 2007). The role for Science is to identify candidate benchmarks and, where possible, describe the probabilities of achieving the target under a set of assumptions (e.g., MSY in a given time frame in the absence of fishing) for each, and not to prescribe specific values. Alternatively, Science can provide a probability function that would specify a value of the lower benchmark given a level of risk tolerance (i.e., Figure 1 with axes reversed).\n2.4 Idealized framework for determining precautionary lower benchmarks\nAn idealized framework for determining precautionary lower benchmarks is shown in Table 1 and Figure 2. The framework comprises nine steps which are each the responsibility of either Science or Fisheries Management. In this framework, fisheries management is a generic term for those requesting advice from Science. In the particular case of the WSP benchmarks, some of the steps are specified by the WSP itself.\nThe nine steps have already been mentioned but for clarity are tabulated here for an example reference frame specified as biological production. The inputs and outputs of each step are made specific to the WSP, as detailed in the Section 2.5.\n2 To recover: to reach or exceed target.\n4\nTable 1.

Those benchmarks “identify when the biological production status of a CU has changed significantly” (Fisheries and Oceans Canada, 2005)(p.18). In particular, the upper benchmark could be “the level expected to provide, on an average annual basis, the maximum annual catch for a CU, given existing\n6\nenvironmental conditions”, and where “there would not be a high probability of losing the CU” (p.18). In contrast, the lower benchmark will be established “at a level of abundance high enough to ensure there is a substantial buffer between it and any level of abundance that could lead to a CU being considered at risk of extinction by COSEWIC”(Fisheries and Oceans Canada, 2005)(p.18). To determine conservation status, COSEWIC considers a defined set of five criteria (Table 2 in (COSEWIC, 2006)). Of these criteria, only criterion D deals primarily with abundance (Table 2). In assessing the extinction risk of marine and anadromous fish species, COSEWIC has usually used criterion A (e.g., (e.g. COSEWIC, 2003a; COSEWIC, 2003b) since that criterion is most applicable to any species where the absolute abundance is either unknown or is too large for the other criteria to apply. Absolute abundance will not be known for many CUs of Pacific salmon since the methods used to estimate escapements mostly provide indices of abundance.\nFigure 3. Benchmarks and zones of biological status to be determined for each conservation\nunit (taken from the Wild Salmon Policy).\n7\nTable 2. Details of the five criteria used by COSEWIC to infer conservation status and their the WSP assessment framework (modified from\nto\ngeneral applicability (COSEWIC, 2006))\nCriterion\nDescription\nStatus is determined by observed, estimated, inferred or suspected rates of decline in total population size over a defined period. Thresholds are dependent on whether or not the reduction or its causes have ceased or are understood or are reversible. Knowledge of declines can come from direct observation or may be inferred from such things as abundance indices, habitat loss, levels of exploitation, or other mortality factors.\ndistribution, and decline or fluctuation\nStatus is determined by either the extent of occurrence or the area of occupancy in conjunction with declines in either of them or in habitat quality, number of populations or number of individuals.\nStatus is determined by both the number of mature individuals and either a continuing decline in number or a population structure that has most mature individuals in small and fragmented populations.\npopulation or restricted distribution E. Quantitative analysis\nStatus is determined primarily by the number of mature individuals but can be modified by the area of occupancy or human threats\nStatus is determined by an estimated probability of extinction in the wild\nIn addition, the WSP states that the lower benchmark will use a “buffer [that] will account for uncertainty in data and control of harvest management” (p.18). By accounting for those uncertainties, the definition of the lower benchmark is consistent with the precautionary lower benchmark described in Section 2.4.\n2.5.2 Indicators of status, incorporating uncertainties\nTo meet the requirements for benchmarks described in the WSP, we suggest four classes of indicators, the first of which, abundances (production), is clearly described in the WSP as one approach for assessing status (p. 17). To minimize COSEWIC listings (the second requirement), we suggest two additional classes of indicators: time trends in spawner abundances and distribution (the later is also suggested in the WSP as an indicator of status). Although COSEWIC criteria do not explicitly include fishing pressure relative to sustainable levels (i.e., relative to intrinsic productivity of the stock), we include that as a fourth class of indicators to assess the likelihood of continued trends in abundances (declines or increases) given current fishing effort. That fourth class differs from the first three in that it reflects an external stressor instead of an intrinsic property of the population. Figure 4 illustrates the hierarchical framework that relates indicators, quantifiable metrics within classes of\n8\nindicators (examples of which are shown in the right column of Table 3 and are described in more detail in Section 3), and benchmarks on each metric. The order in which we present classes of indicators is not meant to represent a priority for assessment. Instead the chosen metrics and their relative weight in the overall assessment will be CU-specific and vary according to data quality and quantity among other considerations.\nClass of Class of indicator indicator\nAbundance Abundance\nChanges in Changes in abundance abundance over time over time\nFishing Fishing mortality mortality\nDistribution: Distribution: abundance, abundance, trends, trends, habitat use habitat use\nUncertainties Uncertainties\nMetrics within Metrics within classes of classes of indicators indicators\nBenchmarks Benchmarks on each on each metric metric\nStatus Status\nFigure 4.

For the qualitative method, the magnitude of measurement or observation errors is classified, in part, based on the method used to collect the data, such as visual surveys, fence counts, or mark-recapture experiments. Pestal and Cass (2007) provide a framework for classifying populations of sockeye salmon on the Fraser River according to the magnitude of uncertainty in the observed spawner data. We have adapted their methodology and the one from Crawford and Rumsey (2009) to classify CUs into the Red zone (high uncertainties), Amber zone (moderate uncertainties), and Green zone (low uncertainties), as described in more detail in Section 3.5.1.\nA more rigorous and quantitative approach for accounting for multiples sources of uncertainties using probabilistic performance criteria (e.g. probability of achieving a goal or endpoint) is Monte Carlo simulation modelling. Moreover, one of the listing criteria for COSEWIC (criterion E) is derived from assessing the probability of extinction (i.e., a probabilistic criterion) using quantitative analyses such as simulation modelling. We used a simulation model that incorporated uncertainties in biological and management components of the fisheries system to evaluate lower benchmarks on two classes of indicators (spawner abundances and fishing mortality) with two performance criteria, the probability of extirpation to long term and probability of recovery to a target over one-three generation(s). For details on the structure of the simulation model and results, see the technical documentation on the Evaluation of Benchmarks for Conservation Units in Canada’s Wild Salmon Policy (Holt, 2009). Further work will be required to develop models that relate performance metrics to benchmarks on the two remaining class of indicators, trends in spawner abundances and distribution of spawners.\n2.5.3 Risk tolerance\n“The determination of the lower benchmark, will include consideration of a risk tolerance” (Fisheries and Oceans Canada, 2005) (p.17). As discussed in Sections 2.3 and 2.4 consideration of risk tolerance is the responsibility of fisheries management and the adoption of any particular risk tolerance is the responsibility of the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans. Here we adapt a risk classification scheme for probabilities of population decline developed in DFO’s “Fishery Decision-Making Framework Incorporating the Precautionary Approach” (2009), in order to categorize probabilities of realizing a specified outcome when evaluating lower benchmarks (Table 4).\n11\nTable 4. Example risk classification scheme adapted from DFO’s “Fishery Decision-making Framework Incorporating the Precautionary Approach” (2009)for probabilities of realizing an outcome.\nProbability of an outcome Less than 5% 5%-25% 25%-50% ~50% 50%-75% 75%-95% &gt;95%\nRisk category Very low Low Moderately low Neutral Moderately low High Very high\nThis classification is similar to one provided by the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization to aid in setting limit reference points (very low probability defined as ≤ 5% and low probability defined as ≤ 20%) (Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization, 2004).\nIn the absence of alternative guidelines for categorizing probabilities of realizing\noutcomes, we follow the classification scheme in Table 4 when evaluating probabilities of extirpation over the long term and probabilities of recovery to a target for CUs. This scheme represents only one possible example; alternative guidelines on risk classification that are directly linked to stakeholder risk tolerances should be considered by fisheries management. To emphasize, Science is limited to providing a function that relates any plausible value of the benchmark to the probability of meeting a criterion (e.g., recovery to a target or extirpation). Fisheries management is responsible for identifying risk tolerance.\nIn Canada, Pestal and Cass (2007) provide an assessment framework for Fraser Rivers sockeye salmon based on three considerations: status, vulnerability, and direct human impacts, in order to “establish a consistent, transparent framework that translates general policies and objectives into practical guidelines for prioritizing assessment projects” (p.6). Although their goal is broad-reaching, one of the policies they consider is Canada’s Wild Salmon Policy. Their indicators of status, vulnerability, and direct human impacts overlap with the indicators identified here. In particular, their measure of status includes current abundances, changes in abundance over time, and distribution over space; vulnerability includes productivity and diversity; and direct human impacts include fishing mortality.\n2.6 Comparison to other assessment frameworks\nThe assessment framework identified here is consistent with previous frameworks for assessing viability of Pacific salmon stocks. For example, in the United States, technical recovery teams (TRTs) have been tasked with identifying performance conditions (viability criteria) that when met, indicate that a population is not likely to go extinct (McElhany et al., 2000). Although the goals of the TRTs differ somewhat from those of the Wild Salmon Policy, both include consideration of probabilities of extirpation. In one study by the TRTs, McElhany et al. (2006) identified what they considered to be the most important dimensions for population viability: abundance and productivity, spatial structure (including habitat use), and diversity. The last dimension, diversity, considers the minimum abundances required to\n12\nmaintain genetic diversity for long-term population persistence. Although diversity is not explicitly included in our list of indicators, COSEWIC criteria D (very small population size, of &lt;1000 fish for a “threatened” listing) allows for sufficient genetic diversity for long-term population persistence if populations are above that level (Bradford and Wood, 2004) (though Reed et al. (2003) suggest that 7000 is a more realistic minimum population size for long- term persistence).\n2.7 Assessment of biological production status and enhancement\nThe roles of salmonid enhancement in conservation and production in Pacific Canada are discussed in the WSP and assurance is given that possible interactions of wild and enhanced fish will be managed through integrated planning (Strategy 4, p. 24-31) and through appropriate technical practices at enhancement facilities. While these generalities and assurances are quite appropriate for a policy document, the more mundane question of how to deal with enhanced fish in a status assessment are left open.\nThis general question is important to a status determination because the enhancement methods used in Pacific Canada and the locations of enhancement activity more often than not result in mixtures of wild and enhanced fish spawning naturally. However, the WSP is quite specific in restricting the policy, and hence the determination of status, to fish that are wild by definition. That definition (see glossary) has two important implications. First, the definition cannot be easily operationalized because the offspring of enhanced fish that spawned in the wild cannot be distinguished from wild fish. Second, given the levels and duration of enhancement in some areas, it is unlikely that there are any wild salmon remaining. For example, levels of enhancement in most chinook CUs around the Strait of Georgia have been intensive for decades and it is likely that few of the natural spawners in rivers like the Cowichan and Nanaimo Rivers are wild.\nPopulations that are dominated by hatcheries (i.e., with little or no contribution of wild fish) are not considered within CUs (e.g., hatchery production on Robertson Creek chinook salmon on the west coast of Vancouver Island are not included in neighbouring CUs) (Holtby and Ciruna, 2007), and are therefore omitted from WSP assessments. For populations that include both wild and hatchery-origin fish, we are unable to find any completely satisfactory manner to assess status. We could exclude those CUs where levels and duration of historical hatchery production are likely to have resulted in the extirpation or near- extirpation of wild fish. We doubt that this would seem reasonable to most Canadians since it would remove perhaps a third of chinook CUs and a fifth of coho CUs from consideration. An alternative is to remove first generation hatchery-origin fish from recruitment time series, but that option does not adhere to the strict definition of wild salmon given in the WSP since those hatchery-origin fish would continue to be tallied in spawner time series in the subsequent generation (and the resulting recruitment). This approach would consider the productivity of fish spawning in the wild instead of wild fish (as defined by the Wild Salmon Policy), which we consider a reasonable compromise.\nThe WSP excludes fish produced from managed spawning channels. That definition cannot be operationalized because the produced fish are almost never marked (i.e., not even\n13\nthe first-generation fish can be recognized) and because the spawning channels are usually small parts of larger systems and so the fish that use them are a mix of enhanced and wild fish. We propose to include these fish in both recruitment and spawner time series if the channel management did not exclude natural mate selection and imposed the same sorts of control that fisheries can produce3.\nAlthough there are a growing number of demonstrations that enhanced salmon are less fit than their wild counterparts (e.g. Araki et al., 2007; Goodman, 2005; Heath et al., 2003; Hindar et al., 2006; Jonsson and Jonsson, 2006; Utter, 2004), hatchery practices in B.C. might avoid some of the effects (Heggenes et al., 2006). DFO biologists generally assert that there are no definitive studies in BC and Pacific salmon where hatchery practices are substantially different from those in the US and Europe (C. Cross, pers. comm., Habitat Enhancement Branch, Fisheries and Oceans Canada, Vancouver). Only Goodman (2005) provides some guidance on the possible safe limits to enhancement for avoiding catastrophic losses to fitness.\nAnother way in which enhanced production may affect wild fish is through increased competition for limited resources in the marine habitat, potentially resulting in reduced body size and/or survival overall, or worse, a greater reduction in the survival of wild fish because of the competitive superiority of hatchery fish. This effect was proposed as the reason for the increasing proportion of hatchery coho in the Strait of Georgia during the 1980’s and 1990’s (e.g. Sweeting et al., 2003). However, more recent trends from the same authors suggests that variation in the relative abundance of hatchery and wild coho is due to interactions of release timing and oceanographic variability rather than density dependence (Beamish et al., 2008).\nAlthough evidence suggests that enhancement may have deleterious effects on the fitness and production of wild fish, there is insufficient information to proceed further at this time in incorporating levels of enhancement into assessments of status, aside from the exclusion of first-generation hatchery fish from the spawner and recruitment time series.\n3.1 Spawner abundances\nFor Pacific salmon, understanding the relationship between spawner abundances and recruitment is essential for identifying the level of spawners (or benchmark) below which yield is reduced. Despite well-known pitfalls of stock-recruitment models (e.g., biased parameter estimates resulting from short or uninformative data), they have long been used as a basis for management decisions (Walters and Korman, 2001). Approaches to address some of those problems have been developed, such as Bayesian analyses that incorporate prior information on carrying capacity (Walters and Korman, 2001) and state-space models that incorporate uncertainties in spawner data (Walters and Korman, 2001). We suggest deriving upper and lower benchmarks on spawner abundances from stock-recruit relationships using\n3 Namely, control of spawner numbers and timing, both of which are actively controlled by fisheries.\n14\nprior information on carrying capacity (where available) in a Bayesian approach. However, for some CUs, recruitment does not show a compensatory response with spawner abundances (i.e., a spawner-recruitment relationship does not exist) and/or the assumption of log-normal variability in recruitment does not hold (S. Cox-Rogers, pers. comm.). In those cases, status may be assessed using other metrics of status, such as those related to trends in abundance or distribution over time, current productivity, or spawner abundances relative to estimates of capacity, as appropriate.\nSpawner abundance at maximum sustainable yield, SMSY, has been embraced by many as a “target reference point” for management (e.g., Irvine et al. (2001), Tompkins et al. (2005)), and is recommended by the UN as a rebuilding target for overfished stocks (UN Agreement on Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks, Annex II). Although the Wild Salmon Policy provides SMSY as an example upper benchmark delineating Green and Amber zones, DFO’s Fishery Decision-Making Framework Incorporating the Precautionary Approach (2009) (or simply DFO’s Decision-Making Framework) recommends an provisional upper reference point for management to delineate “healthy” and “cautious zones” of 80% of SMSY. To be consistent with DFO’s Decision-Making Framework, we recommend an upper benchmark to be equal to (or greater than) 80% of SMSY. Below that spawner abundance, populations are not considered healthy by the Framework and should not be included in the Green zone of the WSP.\nWhile agreement on upper benchmarks is relatively close, consensus on lower benchmarks delineating Amber and Red zones has not been reached. One possibility is spawner abundances at a specified fraction of MSY recruitment (e.g., 0.5, Figure 5, Table 5 for populations that exhibit a Ricker stock-recruitment relationship). DFO’s Decision-Making Framework suggests a provisional lower reference point (delineating “critical” and “cautious” zones) of 40% of biomass (or spawner abundances) at MSY (Figure 5, Table 5). Alternatively, Myers et al. (1994) propose spawner abundances at 50% of maximum recruitment as a lower benchmark below which “recruitment to a fish stock is seriously reduced” (Table 5), and Johnston et al. (2002) propose a limit reference point at a level of spawners that would result in recovery to SMSY within one generation in the absence of fishing, under equilibrium conditions (Figure 5, Table 5). Although the minimum spawner abundance from which the population has recovered has also been suggested as a lower benchmark (Irvine et al., 2001), there is no evidence that such a benchmark would leave a “substantial buffer” between it and spawner abundances associated with a high probability of extirpation, or that abundances would rebuild in the future as they did historically.\n15\nS at S at 50% 50% RMSY RMSY\n40% 40% SMSY SMSY\nSgen Sgen\n80% 80% SMSY SMSY\nSMSY SMSY\n) ) h h s s i i f f\ns s 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 ( (\ns s t t i i\nu u r r c c e e R R\n120 120\n100 100\n80 80\n60 60\n40 40\n20 20\n0 0\nRMSY RMSY\n50% RMSY 50% RMSY\n0 0\n20 20\n40 40\n60 60\n80 80\n100 100\nSpawners (1000s fish) Spawners (1000s fish)\nFigure 5.

That distribution can be derived from Bayesian analyses that incorporate prior information on\n17\nspawner abundances at RMAX (Appendix A, Fig. A 1, Fig. A 2, Fig. A 3, Fig. A 4, and Fig. A 5) or the productivity parameter. This approach is similar to one used by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game to account for uncertainty in management targets(Nelson et al., 2005) and by Bodkter et al. (2007) to evaluate escapement goals on Fraser River sockeye salmon. Careful consideration of the sensitivity of benchmark values to assumptions about the prior distribution will be required.\nFor some species and populations, the Ricker function may not be an appropriate representation of the spawner-recruit relationship because recruitment does not decline at high spawner abundances (i.e., overcompensation, a characteristic of the Ricker relationship, does not occur) or cycle-lines interact to create cyclic patterns in recruitment. In the first case, a Beverton-Holt recruitment function may better reflect asymptotic recruitment at high spawner abundances. Although some management parameters (e.g., SMSY) and the related lower and upper benchmarks (e.g., 40% and 80% of SMSY) can be calculated for the Beverton- Holt function (as described in Table 5 for the Ricker function), others cannot (e.g., S at RMAX)(Hilborn and Walters, 1992) (p.272). For the second case, strong cyclic patterns in sockeye salmon recruitment in the Fraser River have prompted scientists to consider a Larkin model (Walters and Staley, 1987) when setting escapement goals for those stocks (Cass and Grout, 2006; Martell et al., 2008). That model includes the effects of biological interactions among cycle lines due to, for example, competition for food or common predators. Closed- form values of management parameters such as SMSY that vary by cycle line are not available for the Larkin model. Numerical estimates for Fraser River stocks are currently being developed as part of DFO’s Fraser River Sockeye Spawning Initiative to derive harvest control rules (A. Huang, Annacis Island, Fisheries and Oceans Canada), and are not estimated here. For demonstration purposes, we use the Ricker relationship as an example stock- recruitment model. However, that assumption was relaxed in simulation model that evaluated lower benchmarks.\nWhen estimates of SMSY are not available because recruitment and/or productivity data are missing, benchmarks can instead be derived from carrying capacity (the maximum recruitment that the freshwater habitat will support in the absence of fishing mortality) approximated from freshwater studies (e.g., Shortreed et al.(2001)). One possible lower benchmark is a percentage of carrying capacity, e.g., in the range of 10-20% as suggested by Johnston et al. (2002) as a “lower reference point” for B.C. steelhead, or 15% as applied to Skeena River sockeye salmon (Wood, 2004). In a similar way, an upper benchmark can be derived from a percentage of carrying capacity instead of SMSY. For example, when the productivity parameter is 1.0 (~2.7 recruits/spawner at low spawner abundances), an upper benchmark of SMSY is approximately equivalent to 40% of carrying capacity based on the relationship between SMSY (derived in Table 5) and spawner abundances at maximum recruitment replacement and loge(recruits/spawners) at low spawners (Ricker, 1975)).\nspawner abundance at\nratio of\n(equal\nthe\nto\nFor some CUs where data on spawner abundances are not available or are of poor quality, fry or smolt abundances or body sizes may provide a rough indication of spawning status. For example, Bradford et al. (2000) used smolt and spawner density information to identify the carrying capacity of Black Creek coho salmon in units of smolts/km. In addition,\n18\nbody sizes may correlate with spawner abundances insofar as density-dependent growth during freshwater stages results in small (large) juveniles when spawners are abundant (few) (B. Holtby, unpublished analyses). Furthermore, body condition of adults during return migration (as measured by body length and weight, physiological and genetic indicators of fish health, and/or the presence of parasites) may provide an indication of en-route and pre- spawning mortalities, and hence spawning success. Benchmarks for those metrics will be identified on a case-by-case basis where data exist.\n3.2 Trends in spawners\nWe identified metrics of temporal trends in spawner abundances over the short term (the longer of three generations and ten years) and the extent of changes in spawner abundances over the long term (the historical record). Analyses based on recent data may be more appropriate if long-term climate or ecosystem changes prevent a CU from achieving historical unfished levels. On the other hand, those recent data may miss harvest-induced declines that have occurred over several decades, which are captured by long-term metrics. To identify underlying trends in spawner abundances independent of interannual “noise” (e.g., due to cyclic recruitment dynamics, and observation and assessment errors), spawner abundances were log-transformed and then smoothed with a four-year (or one generation) running mean.\nOne possible lower benchmark derived from short-term linear trends (i.e., the slope, or rate of change, of the line of best fit over recent years) is the linear trend associated with a reduction in abundances of 25% over the longer of 3 generations and 10 years, a proportional reduction that is lower than that resulting in a COSEWIC threatened listing (30% decline in abundance of spawners where causes are not known or are irreversible (COSEWIC, 2006)) (e.g., Figure 6 for one example CU, Takla/Trembleur- Early Stuart Run sockeye salmon). One possible upper benchmark is the linear trend associated with a fraction (e.g., 3/5) of that reduction (or, equivalently, a 15% reduction in abundance of spawners over the same period). Uncertainty in the assessment of trends due to incomplete sampling of CUs can be quantified using Bayesian estimation. In particular, the posterior probability distribution of the magnitude of declines can be estimated. Rather than the maximum likelihood estimates of the slope, a specified percentile (e.g., 10th) of the posterior probability distribution will better reflect the degree of uncertainty in those declines (e.g., Appendix A; Fig. A 5). A benchmark based on the 10th percentile of the slope will be smaller (representing a smaller decline in spawner abundances) than a benchmark that ignores uncertainty. Alternatively, sensitivity analyses can be used to assess how robust the results are to the inclusion or exclusion of counting locations with missing values.\n19\n) ) s s e e c c n n a a d d n n u u b b a a r r e e n n w w a a p p s s ( ( e e g g o o L L\n13 13\n12 12\n11 11\n10 10\n9 9\n8 8\n7 7\nmax loge(S) max loge(S)\nmean loge(S) mean loge(S)\n1950 1950\n1960 1960\n1970 1970\n1980 1980\n1990 1990\n2000 2000\n2010 2010\nFigure 6.

The dotted line is the decline in loge(S) associated with a 25% decline over 3 generations (i.e., the lower benchmark). The maximum and mean smoothed loge(S) values over the entire time series are shown on the right.\nTo capture long-term changes in abundances, Pestal and Cass (2007) suggest two metrics based on the ratio of the geometric mean of the current generation to two baselines: the long-term geometric mean and the highest generational mean. In addition, they propose a ratio of ½ to delineate populations of moderate and low status (i.e., Green and Amber zones), and ¼ to delineate those of low and very low status (i.e., Amber and Red zones) based on a qualitative evaluation of expert opinion. These, as well as other metrics of rates of change in spawner abundances are currently under evaluation (Erin Porszt, School of Resource and Environmental Management, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, British Columbia, V5A1S6).\n3.3 Distribution\nWhen multiple populations exist within a CU, the status of the “network of spawning groups” may be more important than the status of the aggregate or any individual population (i.e., spawning group). In particular, the long-term viability of a CU may depend on the genetic, habitat, and life-history diversity of the resident fish, because that diversity will provide the capacity for natural recolonization of populations that may be lost (McElhany et al., 2006). Although CUs are defined as mutually interchangeable groups of wild salmon with similar habitats, genetic structure, and ecological characteristics, some types and/or levels of diversity were not considered in CU designation (Holtby and Ciruna, 2007) and may be important for their long-term persistence. For example, to identify boundaries among CUs, habitats were classified into freshwater and marine adaptive zones based on two ecological classification schemes that considered patterns of climate, drainage density, gradient, hydrological characteristics, connectivity, marine circulation patterns (e.g., fjords and straights), among other factors (Augerot et al., 1999; Ciruna and Butterfield, 2005). Fine- scale features of habitats such as patterns of stream, lake, and wetland morphology and drainage basins &lt; 22,000 km2 were not considered (Holtby and Ciruna, 2007), but may be\n20\nassociated with adaptations of fish to their local environment (Kitanishi et al., 2009; Neville et al., 2006; Tallman and Healey, 1994). The CU classification scheme also used information on genetic population structure obtained from the analysis of microsatellite loci in hierarchical classification trees, calculated using clustering algorithms (Terry Beacham and the Pacific Biological Station Genetics Lab, Fisheries and Oceans Canada, Nanaimo, B.C., V9T 6N7). Although the maximum number of levels generated in the hierarchical classification trees was five, Holtby and Ciruna (2007) found that the third and fourth levels captured the major population groupings. Genetic variability at finer scales (fourth and fifth levels, i.e., within CUs) may represent adaptive and heritable diversity if that variability is associated with phenotypic or life-history traits. Information on ecological considerations such as spawn timing, migration, and smolt age was also included in the CU classification scheme when genetic information (to the level considered in the hierarchical classification trees) suggested CU boundaries that differed from habitat-derived boundaries. Therefore, variability in life-history traits associated with fine-scale genetic variability (fourth or fifth levels) was not considered, and may exist within CUs.\nAlthough monitoring all components of diversity (habitat, genetic, and ecological) may be logistically difficult, indicators of distribution that use data on the arrangement, habitat, time trends in abundance, and location of spawning groups may provide surrogate measures of that diversity. We have identified candidate metrics that reflect four types of distribution: (1) distribution of spawners among spawning groups (or counting locations), e.g., Walters and Cahoon (1985), (2) distribution of spawners among habitat types (McElhany et al., 2006), (3) distribution in temporal trends, as described for Bristol Bay sockeye salmon populations (Rogers and Schindler, 2008), and (4) spatial structure of spawning groups, e.g., distance between spawning groups (McElhany et al., 2006). The example metrics we present are preliminary; further work is currently underway to identify metrics of distribution that reflect the diversity of spawning groups within CUs (S. Peacock and C. Holt, Pacific Biological Station, Fisheries and Oceans Canada). Our example metrics are meant to supplement, and not replace, other information currently available on genetic, habitat, and ecological diversity within CUs.\n3.3.1 Distribution of spawners among groups\nMost simply, the distribution of spawners across locations can be measured by the number of extant locations of spawners (one metric used by COSEWIC to assess distributional status) (COSEWIC, 2006). Two additional metrics of spawner distribution are the number of spawning groups with abundances &gt;100 fish (e.g., Figure 7) (or the number with more than a certain percentage of the total spawner abundance to the CU, e.g., 5%), and the number of groups that contain some percentage (e.g., 80%) of the total abundance when ranked from most to least abundant. These metrics have an advantage over the simple count of spawning groups, of differentiating CUs that have a number of equally abundant spawning groups from those with a single dominant group and a number of very small groups. For highly concentrated CUs, when ranked from most to least abundant, the top 80% of the total abundance will be comprised of only one spawning group; for dispersed CUs, that 80% will consist of several (e.g., Figure 8). Trends over time in distribution may indicate changes in the locations or spawners or alterations in spatial structure. However, care must be taken to\n21\nensure that apparent changes in distribution are due to changes in the status of the network of spawning groups rather than inconsistent sampling coverage over time.\nh h\nt t i i\nw w s s n n o o\ni i t t\na a c c o o\nl l\ng g n n i i t t n n u u o o c c\nf f o o r r e e b b m m u u N N\n0 0 0 0 1 1 &gt; &gt; s s e e c c n n a a d d n n u u b b a a r r e e n n w w a a p p s s\n40 40\n30 30\n20 20\n10 10\n0 0\n37 38 38 38 38 37 37 37 37 35 34 34 35 37 38 38 38 38 37 37 37 37 35 34 34 35\n1995 1995\n1997 1997\n1999 1999\n2001 2001\n2003 2003\n2005 2005\n2007 2007\nFigure 7.

The numbers inside the bars represent the minimum number of counting locations required to make up 80% of the total abundance in each generation.\nAn alternative metric of distribution proposed by Walters and Cahoon (1985) is the cumulative escapement over counting locations ranked by abundance (e.g., Figure 9). The area under the curve (AUC) of that relationship reflects the degree of concentration of spawners among groups. CUs with highly equitable distributions (i.e., all spawning groups at equal abundances) will have AUC values of 0.5 (representing a diagonal line from the origin to (1,1)); CUs with highly concentrated distributions will have values closer to 1.0\n23\n(representing a concave curve between the origin and (1,1) passing near (0,1)). AUC values of less than 0.5 are impossible due to the rank order of the X-axis.\ns s r r e e n n w w a a p p s s\nl l\na a t t o o t t\nf f o o n n o o i i t t r r o o p p o o r r p p e e v v i i t t a a u u m m u u C C\nl l\n1.0 1.0\n0.8 0.8\n0.6 0.6\n0.4 0.4\n0.2 0.2\n0.0 0.0\n1993-1996: AUC= 0.75 1993-1996: AUC= 0.75 1997-2000: AUC = 0.71 1997-2000: AUC = 0.71 2001-2004: AUC = 0.69 2001-2004: AUC = 0.69 2005-2008: AUC = 0.68 2005-2008: AUC = 0.68\n0.0 0.0\n0.2 0.2\n0.4 0.4\n0.6 0.6\n0.8 0.8\n1.0 1.0\nRanked spawning group as a proportion of the Ranked spawning group as a proportion of the total number of spawning groups total number of spawning groups\nFigure 9.

AUC is area under the curve.\n24\nIn addition, the Interior Fraser Coho Recovery Team (2006) provided a recovery objective for the distribution of coho salmon in the B.C. interior: generational average spawner abundances greater than 1000 fish for at least half of the sub-populations within each of the five interior Fraser populations. Their target was derived from simulation modelling of sockeye salmon (N. Schubert, Co-operative Resource Management Institute, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, B.C., V5A 1S6, unpublished analyses) and other salmon species (McElhany et al., 2006), with the overall goal of ensuring viability of the entire Interior population of coho salmon.\n3.3.2 Distribution of spawners among habitat types\nCUs that cover a large spatial area with heterogeneous habitats may be associated with the expression of a wider variety of life-history traits than those that cover only a small area (or proportion of available habitat) or single habitat type and therefore may be better able to respond to changes in environmental conditions (Busch et al., 2008; McElhany et al., 2006). The extent of occurrence of a population and area of occupancy are included as IUCN Red list criteria (IUCN, 2001) and COSEWIC listing criteria (COSEWIC, 2006). For example, an area of occupancy of &lt; 2 000 km2 will result in a “threatened” listing if the population is also declining or fluctuating (COSEWIC, 2006). Without a decline or fluctuations, an area of occupancy of &lt; 20 km is required for a “threatened” listing. Spatial extent of salmon within CUs can also be captured by metrics such as the total stream length available to spawners, accounting for blockages to fish passage.\nPotential metrics of habitat diversity include the distribution of spawners across stream orders and the proportion of spawners using various microhabitats (e.g., beach versus stream habitat, for CUs that contain that fine-scale level of habitat diversity). Cooney et al. (2007) captured habitat diversity with the proportion of spawners occupying different ecoregions, which are classified by climate, soil, geology, vegetation and land-use (Cooney et al., 2007). Due to overlap with Strategy 2 of the Wild Salmon Policy, metrics and benchmarks on habitat type are not developed here.\n3.3.3 Distribution of time-trends in spawner abundances\nThe distribution in temporal responses of spawning groups to environmental or anthropogenic stressors may be associated with the capacity of a CU to persist over the long term. A wide distribution of responses will be associated with an increased probability that at least one spawning group will persist under future environmental conditions. Variability in responses to common disturbances has been observed in asynchronous trends in productivity among neighbouring stocks of BC and Alaskan Pacific salmon that are exposed to similar conditions (Dorner et al., 2007; Rogers and Schindler, 2008). Those divergent responses may be associated with fine-scale habitat (e.g., at the lake scale (Rogers and Schindler, 2008)) and genetic variability. The proportion of individual spawning groups that exceed declines associated with benchmarks for aggregate spawners (as described in Section 3.2) or the spread (range or standard deviation) in the slope of the linear trends can be used as metrics of distribution in time trends (e.g., Figure 10).\n25\ny c n e u q e r F\n0 1\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\n-0.8\n-0.6\n-0.4\n-0.2\n0.0\n0.2\nLinear rate of change of loge(spawner abundances)\nFigure 10.

Only counting locations with &lt;50% missing data points over the last 15 years were included. The linear rate of change associated with 15% and 25% declines in abundances over three generations are shown with dotted and dashed lines, respectively. 92.3% of counting locations had rates of declines greater than those that associated with the lower benchmark.\n3.3.4 Spatial structure\nSpatial structure of spawning groups within a CU reflects its vulnerability to a single catastrophic event (e.g., a flow blockage) and the likelihood of recolonization of locally depleted groups (McElhany et al., 2006). Spawning groups that are highly aggregated may be at greater risk of catastrophic loss due to single stressor, whereas those that are highly\n26\ndispersed may experience delayed recolonization. Qualitative assessments of the spatial extent and arrangement of spawning groups, connectivity, and risk of catastrophe will be valuable when considering spatial structure (as described in the viability criteria for ESA- listed Pacific salmon stock in the U.S.) (Busch et al., 2008).\nWith the exception of the benchmark developed by the Interior Fraser Coho Recovery Team and COSEWIC criteria (B and D), we do not provide benchmarks on metrics of distribution because of a lack of theoretical basis and data to identify specific levels that will result in reduced production and/or increased probabilities of extirpation. Instead, these metrics provide an overall picture of the distributional properties of a CU, which may indicate specific questions for further investigation. For example, a trend towards increasing concentration of spawners may warrant examinations into the causes and specific geographic location of the changes (e.g., is the trend due to an increase in abundance of one dominant spawning group or to a loss of several weak spawning groups?).\n3.4 Fishing mortality\nFishing rates assess intensity of fishing pressure and, in some cases where information on spawner abundances is not available, benchmarks based on them may be more easily applied to management regulations than benchmarks on abundances. By maintaining fishing rates below acceptable levels, it may be possible to restore and maintain healthy populations without measuring spawner abundances directly. Although it might at first seem prudent to use FMSY as an upper benchmark (delineating Green and Amber zones) “to provide, on an average annual basis, the maximum annual catch for a CU” (Fisheries and Oceans Canada, 2005) (p.18), the UN Agreement of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks (1995) recommends FMSY be used as a “limit” or lower reference point. Furthermore, DFO’s Fisheries Decision-Making Framework Incorporating the Precautionary Approach (2009) recommends that fishing mortalities remain below FMSY. To be consistent with those initiatives and limit reference points used in other fisheries (e.g., Atlantic salmon as described by the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organization, and U.S. west coast groundfish, Pacific Fisheries Management Council), we suggest using FMSY as a lower benchmark instead. Upper benchmarks can instead be derived from a percentage of FMSY (e.g., 70%, a provisional upper benchmark until further information is available). Therefore, although a lower benchmark on fishing mortality of FMSY may at first seem too precautionary (i.e., too high) to be consistent with lower benchmarks on spawner abundances that are &lt;&lt; SMSY (e.g., Sgen), it is consistent with previous management experience and so we consider it as a candidate lower benchmark here. Note, the prioritization or weighting of conflicting indicators of status will be an important next step, highlighted by this example.\nIf estimates of FMSY are too optimistic (i.e., are biased upwards), then benchmarks derived from those estimates may allow fishing rates to be higher than acceptable levels. Indeed, when derived from a Ricker spawner-recruitment relationship (Hilborn and Walters, 1992), estimates of the Ricker a parameter and hence FMSY are usually biased upwards, especially when time series of data are short (see Table 6 for FMSY equation). This bias results, in part, from measurement errors in spawner abundances and lack of independence between spawner and recruitment data (Walters and Martell, 2004). To reduce biases in FMSY,\n27\na values can be estimated independently of the stock-recruitment relationships, from the mean loge(R/S) observed historically (Gibson and Myers, 2004). Although that approximation will underestimate the true value (and hence FMSY), it can set a useful lower bound. A newly developed approach for estimating stock-recruitment parameters that avoids many of the biases described above, uses time-series analysis to derive annual estimates of loge(R/S) residuals that are shared among neighbouring stocks. That approach has been applied to Skeena River sockeye salmon to estimate benchmarks for management (Walters et al., 2008), but has yet to be rigorously tested in a simulation model.\nTable 6. Equations used to calculate benchmarks on fishing mortality. “a” is the productivity\nparameter of the Ricker spawner-recruitment relationship and “b” is the spawner abundance at replacement (or equilibrium).\nUpper benchmark\nDescription Proportion of fishing mortality at MSY (e.g., 0.7)\nLower benchmark\nFishing mortality at MSY\nSlope at the origin of the spawner- recruitment relationship\nMedian log- transformed recruits- per-spawner\nSlope at the origin of the spawning female- smolt relationship\nLabel 0.7·FMSY\nEquation = 0.7·(-loge (1-(0.5·a-0.07·a2)))\nFMSY\nFMAX\n= -loge (1-(0.5·a-0.07·a2))\na (or mean loge (recruits/spawner))\nFMED\nMedian(loge (recruits/spawner))\nFSM\nDerived from spawning female- smolt, as described in Bradford et al. (2000)\nAlternative lower benchmarks on fishing mortality include the slope at the origin of the stock-recruitment relationship (FMAX, as suggested by Mace (1993) (i.e., the maximum log-transformed recruits-per-spawner at low spawner abundances), the median log- transformed recruits-per-spawner (FMED, as suggested by Sissenwine and Shepherd (1987)), and the slope at the origin of the smolt-recruitment relationship, a benchmark that is independent of variability in freshwater survival (Bradford et al., 2000).\nWe suggest fishing mortality relative to productivity as an indicator of status because\nit may detect unsustainable (high) fishing rates that may result in stock depletion. Although fishing mortalities greater than the lower benchmark will indicate that, if maintained, the fishing mortality may result in a threatened listing by COSEWIC (i.e., status in the Red zone), the converse is not necessarily true. Fishing mortalities below the lower benchmark may\n28\nresult from reduced fishing pressure on severely depleted or commercially unviable stocks. Indeed, marine survival of several populations of North Coast salmon are below replacement despite near zero fishing mortality, suggesting the Green status on that metric for those CUs may be inappropriate as an overall indicator of status. Furthermore, historical time series on survival may be inappropriate for estimating productivity when parameters are time-varying (i.e., historical conditions are not representative of current conditions). Where possible, marine survival should be estimated annually from smolt abundances or fry abundances and recruitment to better inform current estimates of productivity.\nWe recommend that assessment on this metric be considered in combination with\nknown management decisions and other indicators of status (e.g., trends in abundances and distribution) to distinguish among possible reasons for the observed status. Other anthropogenic stressors are considered in other strategies of the WSP (e.g., habitat modification under Strategy 2).\n3.5 Incorporating uncertainties into assessments\n3.5.1 A qualitative approach for incorporating uncertainties\nTo evaluate the degree of uncertainty in observed data when assessing status of sockeye salmon stocks in the Fraser River, Pestal and Cass (2007) proposed five categories of data quantity and quality based on the number of years with observations of spawner abundance and methods for collecting data (e.g., visual surveys, fence counts, and mark- recapture experiments). Crawford and Rumsey (2009) suggest an alternative classification scheme based in part, on the number of sub-populations within an assessment unit (e.g., CU) for which data is available. We have adapted those schemes to classify the data on spawner abundances and recruitment into three zones: Green (low uncertainties), Amber, (moderate uncertainties), and Red (high uncertainties), using criteria described in Table 7. Those guidelines may be further adapted to the specific characteristics of data in each CU.\n29\nTable 7. Criteria to categorize uncertainties in spawner and recruitment data into Green,\nAmber, and Red zones, adapted from Pestal and Cass (2007) and Crawford and Rumsey (2009).\nZone\nSpawner data\nRecruitment data\nGreen\nAmber\nRed\n ≥ 50% of known spawning sites with data  For the spawning sites with data, ≥ 50% of years with observations in the last 3 generations and ≥ 50% of years with observations in the last generation  Visual estimates calibrated with a fence or mark-recapture experiment  Sampling design unbiased with known precision\n ≥ 25% of known spawning sites with data  For the spawning sites with data, ≥ 50% of years with observations in the last 3 generations and ≥ 50% of years with observations in the last generation  Visual estimates only  Sampling design unbiased  &lt;25% known spawning sites with data  &lt; 50% of years with observations in the last 3 generations or &lt; 50% of years with observations in the last generation  Visual estimates only\n ≥ 50% of years with observations in the last 3 generations and ≥ 50% of years with observations in the last generation  Harvested in a single-stock fishery where catch can be attributed to a specific CU\n ≥ 50% of years with observations in the last 3 generations and ≥ 50% of years with observations in the last generation  Harvested in a multi-stock fishery where catch cannot be easily attributed to a specific CU\n &lt; 50% of years with observations in the last 3 generations or &lt; 50% of years with observations in the last generation  Harvested in a multi-stock fishery where catch cannot be easily attributed to a specific CU\nUncertainties in the data used to assess status may influence the overall assessment of a CU. For example, a CU that has a biological status in the Amber zone, but an uncertainty status in the Red zone may warrant an overall status of Red. One simple approach to combining information on biological status and uncertainty in the data is a two-dimensional assessment rule, as described in Figure 11. Although conceptually simple and easy to implement, this approach considers measurement errors only (and not natural variability,\n30\nerrors in estimating benchmarks, or variability in outcomes of implementing fishing regulations), and does not evaluate the implications of those errors on the probability of extirpation over the long-term or probability of recovery to a target in the short term. Alternatively, a simulation modelling approach explicitly accounts for all major sources of uncertainties in a quantitative way and can evaluate the impacts of those uncertainties on probabilistic performance criteria.\nLess Less uncertain uncertain\nOverall level of Overall level of uncertainty uncertainty\nHighly Highly uncertain uncertain\nLow Low\nHigh High\nBiological status Biological status\nFigure 11. An example two-dimensional assessment rule to combine information on\nbiological status (X-axis) with the level of uncertainty in that status (Y-axis). The colour of the cell (red= diagonal lines, amber= no lines or dots, green = dots) indicates the overall status that combines information on biological status and uncertainty.\n3.5.2 Simulation modelling to incorporate uncertainties and evaluate lower\nbenchmarks\nUsing a Monte Carlo simulation model, we evaluated benchmarks from two classes of indicators, spawner abundances and fishing mortality, on two probabilistic performance criteria: the probability of extirpation over 100 years and probability of recovery to a target (SMSY) in one (or three) generations. That simulation model is described in the technical documentation on the Evaluation of Benchmarks for Conservation Units in Canada’s Wild Salmon Policy (Holt, 2009); only a brief summary of the methods and results is given here. In particular, we compared the performance of lower benchmarks on spawner abundances along\n31\na gradient in size (from 10-90% of recruitment MSY (RMSY, i.e., recruitment at SMSY), to three others that have been cited in the scientific literature or have been suggested for managing Pacific fisheries: spawner abundance at 50% of RMAX, 40% of SMSY, and Sgen, the spawner abundance that will result in recovery to SMSY within one generation under equilibrium conditions. In addition, we compared the performance of lower benchmarks on fishing mortality along a gradient in size (from 50% to 150% of FMSY), to two others from the literature, FMAX (maximum log-transformed recruits-per-spawner at low spawner abundances) and FMED (median log-transformed recruits-per-spawner). For both classes of indicators, we evaluated performance under a pessimistic (aggressive) management scenario, while still recognizing the lower benchmarks. For benchmarks on spawner abundance, we applied a constant escapement policy equivalent to the lower benchmark. For benchmarks on fishing mortality, we applied a constant fishing mortality rule equivalent to the lower benchmark. Our examples represent the worst-case scenario (i.e., high fishing effort and therefore high probability of extirpation and low probability of recovery); other harvest rules where escapement or harvest rates are adjusted according to observed spawner abundances or catches, will be associated with improved performance (reduced probability of extirpation and increased probability of recovery). Evaluating alternative harvest control rules in a simulation model is beyond the scope of this report, but will be necessary before implementing those rules in the fishery.\nFor metrics of spawner abundances, we found that the lower benchmark, Sgen, was associated with a relatively low probability of extirpation (probability &lt;25%; risk classification adapted from DFO’s “Fishery decision-making framework incorporating the Precautionary Approach” (2009)) over 100 years for populations with equilibrium abundances &gt; 15,000 fish, and high probability of recovery to SMSY within three generations (probability &gt;75%) after accounting for uncertainties in all major components of the fishery system. Furthermore, the probabilities of extirpation over 100 years for Sgen were more robust to variability in stock productivity compared with benchmarks calculated from proportions of SMSY. For metrics of fishing mortality, the lower benchmark FMSY was associated with a relatively low probability of extirpation (probability &lt;25%) over 100 years for populations with equilibrium abundances &gt; 30,000, and high probability of recovery to SMSY within three generations (probability &gt;75%), and its performances was more robust to variability in stock productivity than other benchmarks on fishing mortality derived from the scientific literature.\nAlthough simulation modelling has been embraced as a methodology for evaluating probabilistic outcomes to inform management decision (e.g., probability of extirpation (Dulvy et al., 2004)), the outputs of those models are highly sensitive to assumptions about model structure and parameter values. Mace et al. (2008) suggest that simulation models of population viability are more valuable for assessing relative performance of possible management decisions (e.g., evaluating performance of various benchmarks relative to one another or performance of a single benchmarks under various assumptions about model structure or parameterization) than for identifying the absolute probability of a specified outcome. We therefore recommend evaluating benchmarks on their relative performance and their sensitivity to model assumptions, in addition to (and perhaps with reduced emphasis on) absolute performance.\n32\nBased on our simulation model results, sensitivity analyses, and the preliminary risk classification scheme adapted from DFO’s Decision-Making Framework (2009), we recommend a lower benchmark on spawner abundances derived from Sgen, and a lower benchmark on fishing mortality equivalent to FMSY. Sgen was also chosen by the BC Ministry of the Environment as a limit reference point (a level of abundance “that defines a highly undesired state” (Johnston et al., 2002)(p.4)) for steelhead, Oncorhynchus mykiss, based on the results of a similar simulation modelling exercise. In the absence of data on stock productivity to calculate Sgen, the lower benchmark, 20% of carrying capacity, or spawner abundances at maximum recruitment, can be used as a proxy (Johnston et al., 2002). That recommendation differs from that of earlier analyses due to additional results showing reduced sensitivity of Sgen to a wide range in possible future productivities. The choice of FMSY as a lower benchmark on fishing mortality is consistent with the recommendation of FMSY as a “limit reference point” by the UN Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks Agreement (1995). However, these recommendations on lower benchmarks will need to be re-evaluated once the risk tolerances of stakeholders are identified. One caveat of our simulations analyses is that the results apply to CUs where recruitment is derived from a stock-recruitment relationship. For some CUs, recruitment levels have been consistently below replacement, suggesting stock-recruitment models do not apply and benchmarks based on them are inappropriate. In those cases, we suggest deriving status from trends in abundances and distribution over time, current estimates of productivity, and abundances relative to freshwater estimates of capacity (but those capacity estimates will be insensitive to changes in marine carrying capacity and survival).\n3.6 Non-stationarity\nNon-stationarity is pervasive in fisheries systems. Temporal variability in biological processes and the parameters that describe them are driven by changes in physical and ecological conditions related to anthropogenic and natural stressors. Benchmarks that require long time series of historical data may not represent thresholds for current conditions. In scenarios dominated by non-stationarity, metrics reflecting recent trends in abundances or distribution over time, or current estimates of fishing mortality and productivity, may better reflect status than those that use stock-recruitment models based on historical data.\n3.7 Data requirements\nThe application of indicators, metrics, and benchmarks to individual CUs will depend in part on data availability (Table 8). For example, when time series of spawner and recruitment data are available, status can be assessed from current estimates of spawner abundances and benchmarks derived from the spawner-recruitment relationship. When those time series are not available, spawner abundances may be assessed relative to independent estimates of capacity. Furthermore, when current estimates of spawner abundances are not available, it may be possible to assess status from fishing mortality relative to estimates of productivity. Except in a few CUs with high quality data, it will not be possible to apply the full suite of metrics and benchmarks to assess status.\n33\nTable 8.

APPLICATION OF BENCHMARKS TO TWO EXAMPLE CUs\n4.1 Takla/Trembleur sockeye salmon\n4.1.1 Data\nSpawner abundances for Takla/Trembleur (Early Stuart) sockeye were estimated using a combination of visual surveys (ground and aerial, 41 streams 1950-2008, each with between one and 59 years of data) and a fence count at Dust Creek. Visual estimates of abundance were expanded to total annual abundances using a multiplication factor estimated from the fence count. Assessment methods have been consistent since 1987 when the fence was introduced, though refinements to the expansion factor have occurred since then. All visual estimates prior to 1987 have been expanded to total abundances (data available from Keri Benner, Fisheries and Oceans Canada, 985 McGill Place, Kamloops, B.C., V2C 6X6).\nThe optimum escapement of Takla and Trembleur lakes (number of adult spawners required to fully use the rearing capacity) was estimated to be 779 000 fish based on the relationship between seasonally averaged photosynthetic rate and juvenile sockeye production (Shortreed et al., 2001).\nEstimates of sockeye recruitment to Takla and Trembleur lakes were derived from the Early Stuart run-timing group of the Fraser River (return years 1953 through 2007) (K. Forrest, Pacific Salmon Commission, 600-1155 Robson St., Vancouver, BC., V6E 1B5, pers. comm.), since that run-timing group is composed primarily of fish returning to those two lakes. Takla and Trembleur lakes contributed &gt;99.9% of total escapement for Early Stuarts in all years except 1972 in which Takla and Trembleur fish comprised 98.6% of the total (K. Benner, pers. comm.). Recruitment estimates include the sum of spawning escapement, en-route mortality, and catch from marine and in-river commercial fisheries, marine and in-river test fisheries, Fraser River First Nations harvests, and recreational fisheries (Pacific Salmon Commission, 2001).\n4.1.2 Indicators of status\nSpawner abundances\nParameters of the stock-recruitment relationship were estimated in a Bayesian context with a normally distributed prior on the carrying capacity, i.e., spawner abundances at RMAX (mean of the prior derived from Shortreed et al. (2001) (Appendix A, Fig. A 1 and Fig. A 2). The median of the posterior distribution varied by &lt;10 000 fish when a uniform prior was used (dotted line, Fig. A 2) instead of an informative prior, suggesting that the posterior distribution was only weakly influenced by the prior, and conversely was strongly influenced by the data. We used Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods to generate the posterior distribution for model parameters. Upper benchmarks on SMSY, 80% of SMSY, and 40% of carrying capacity were estimated to be 396,000; 316,000; and 312,000 fish, respectively. The lower benchmarks, Sgen and 20% of carrying capacity were estimated at 118,000 and 156,000 fish, respectively. Additional benchmarks described in Section 3.1\n36\nand recommended previously by fisheries management or the scientific literature, were also calculated for comparison. Values for the alternative lower benchmarks ranged from 137 000 (S at 50% of RMSY) to 170,000 (90th percentile of S at 50%·RMSY, a precautionary estimate of that value given uncertainty in the underlying data). The 90th percentile of SMSY, a precautionary estimate of the upper benchmark, SMSY, was almost twice as large as SMSY itself (746,000 instead of 396,000). The current estimate of spawner abundances (2008) and generational mean (2005-2008) (29,835 and 27,371 fish respectively) fell below all lower (and upper) benchmarks for this class of indicators. The statuses of Takla/Trembleur sockeye salmon on this and the remaining classes of indicators are described in more detail in Appendix A.\nTrends in spawners\nRecent declines in spawner abundances were larger than those designated by most lower benchmarks (Figure 6). The probability that the slope of decline exceeded the lower benchmark was &lt;0.001 (Fig. A 5). However, over the long term, the declines were relatively small. In fact, the ratio of the geometric mean spawner abundance to the long- term mean was greater than the upper benchmark, resulting in Green status on that metric.\nDistribution\nThe number of spawning groups consisting of &gt;100 fish declined from 37 in 1993- 1996 to 35 in 2005-2008 for this CU (Figure 7). Ten spawning groups comprised the top 80% of total spawners in the most recent generation (2005-2008) (Figure 8). 68% of spawning groups currently have geometric mean spawner abundances that exceed 1000 fish (i.e., greater than the 50% threshold of the Interior Fraser Coho Recovery Team (2006)). The area under the curve (AUC) of the relationship between ranked spawner group and cumulative proportion of total spawners declined from 0.75 in 1993-1996 to 0.68 in the most recent generation (2005-2008) (i.e., the distribution is now more dispersed; Figure 9). That AUC values have decreased since 1993-1996, in large part due to the steep decline in one dominant spawning group, Driftwood, in the mid-1990s.\nThe slopes of the linear changes in log-transformed spawner abundances over the most current three generations ranged from -0.84 to +0.24 among spawning groups, 92% of which had declines that were below the lower benchmark associated with a 25% reduction in abundances (Figure 10). When only locations with no missing values were included, that percentage was 91%.\nTo assess distribution of spawners across spatial locations and habitat types in the Takla/Trembleur CU, further investigations are required in coordination with Strategy 2 of the Wild Salmon Policy.\nFishing mortality\nBoth the most recent estimate of fishing mortaliy (F = 0.0791 or equivalently, harvest rate = 7.6%, 2007) and the most recent generational mean (F =0.176, harvest rate = 16.1%) fell in the Green zone, i.e., below all upper (and lower) benchmarks. Fishing mortalities have been relatively low in this CU since the mid 1990s.\n37\nUncertainties in data Uncertainties\nin spawner and\nfor Takla/Trembleur sockeye corresponding to a Green status on that metric. Time series of spawner and recruitment data are continuous over the last three generations for over 80% of spawning groups, visual estimates of spawner abundances are calibrated with a fence count, and &gt;98% of the Early Stuart run can be assigned to the Takla/Trembleur CU (i.e., recruits are harvested, for the most part, in a single-stock fishery).\nrecruitment data are\nrelatively\nlow\n4.2 Hecate Strait Lowlands odd-year pink salmon\n4.2.1 Data\nSpawner abundances for Hecate Strait Lowlands odd-year pink salmon have been estimated at 175 counting locations using visual ground surveys (1951 through 2005, data available from the NuSEDS database at the Pacific Biological Station, Fisheries and Oceans Canada, Nanaimo, B.C.). Although some information on relative abundances exist prior to 1950, in many cases those data are qualitative. Estimates of spawner abundances from 1950 until 1998 are highly uncertain due to changes in survey effort and personnel over that period, the absence of counting fences to standardize observed numbers, and the lack of documentation on multiplication factors used to expand observed numbers to total abundances (Brian Spilsted, Fisheries and Oceans Canada, 417 - 2nd Avenue West, Prince Rupert, B.C., V8J 1G8, pers. comm.). Since 1998, area-under-the-curve analyses have been used to estimate total spawners from observed abundances and run-timing, and the details of those methods have been recorded.\n4.2.2 Indicators of status:\nSpawner abundances\nWe were not able to identify benchmarks on spawner abundances for this CU for at least three reasons: catch data (and hence recruitment) have not yet been compiled due to difficulties in assigning area-wide catches to specific CUs, freshwater capacity is unknown, and stock-recruitment relationships have not been estimated.\nTrends in spawners\nThe rate of change in log-transformed spawner abundances aggregated over all counting locations was positive over the last ten years, warranting a green status on that metric (Appendix B, Fig. B 1). The probabilities that the true rate of change in log- transformed spawner abundances was less than the upper and lower benchmarks (rate of change associated with 15% and 25% reduction in abundances, respectively) were less than the candidate threshold of 10%, (6.6% and 8.1%, respectively) warranting a Green status on that metric (Appendix B, Fig. B 2). Status was also Green for the metric describing the long-term extent of changes in spawner abundances (ratios of current geometric mean spawner abundance over the current generation to the historical mean and maximum).\n38\nDistribution\nThe number of spawning groups consisting of &gt;100 fish increased from 33 in 1995 to 71 in 2001, and then declined to 34 in 2005 (Appendix B, Fig. B 3). The top 80% of ranked spawner abundances was comprised of eleven spawning groups in 2005 (Appendix B, Fig. B 4). Of the counting groups that were observed in 2005 (the most current year), 79% had geometric mean spawner abundances that exceeded 1000 fish (i.e., greater than the 50% threshold of the Interior Fraser Coho Recovery Team (2006)). The area under the curve of the relationship between ranked spawner group and cumulative proportion of total spawners was the same in 2005 as in 1995 (0.115) (Appendix B, Fig. B 5).\nLinear rates of change in loge-transformed spawner abundances over the most recent ten years ranged from -0.77 to +0.95, and 28.8% of spawning groups had declines that were below that associated with the lower benchmark (reduction in abundances &gt; 25% over the time period) (Appendix B, Fig. B 6). When only locations with no missing values over the 10-year period were included, that percentage was 7.7%.\nAs for the Takla/Trembleur sockeye CU, further studies are required to assess\ndistribution of spawners across spatial locations and habitat types in this CU.\nFishing mortality\nWe were not able to assess status on fishing mortality for this CU because catch data\nhave not yet been compiled, as described in the “Spawner abundances” sub-section above.\nUncertainties\nThe estimates of spawner abundances are highly uncertain because visual estimates have not been calibrated with absolute numbers (e.g., from fence counts), field and analytical methods of assessment have varied over time, and those changes are not well documented. In addition, time series of catches have not been estimated, in part due to difficulties in assigning area-wide catches to CUs.\nIn order to evaluate biological status of CUs, we recommend that the following\nsteps be taken.\ngroups within CUs (the third class of indicators).\nindicators and measures of uncertainty.\n39\n(5) Consider alternative risk classification schemes associated with risk tolerances\nidentified by stakeholders.\nThis document provides methodological background to perform those next steps, but several challenges remain. In particular, we provide a multi-dimensional assessment of status on four classes of indicators, but fisheries management may prefer a single overall assessment to inform decision making. Rules can be established to prioritize and combine data across metrics, but that integration will result in a substantial loss of information. “Multi-attribute analysis” is a field of decision analysis that developed in the 1970s to address this challenge (Keeney and Raiffa, 1976). It has been applied extensively to resource management (Herath and Prato, 2006; Nair and Sicherman, 1980) and could used to combine information across metrics of status. A second challenge will be evaluating the status of CUs for which we have no or little information. One possible approach is to integrate information across neighbouring CUs that are believed to have similar dynamics, responses to stressors, and status. Combining that information can be done quantitatively (e.g., using hierarchical models or meta-analyses), or qualitatively. When integrating information over numerous CUs, the risks of overlooking a CU that may have diverging status on one or several indicators will need to be weighed against logistical difficulties of collecting data from all CUs on all dimensions of status. Finally, a preliminary status overview of all CUs may be required before data on CU-specific catch and/or fishing mortality are available to assess status and identify benchmarks on all classes of indicators. For CUs with high-quality spawner data, a preliminary assessment based on spawner abundances relative to estimates of freshwater capacity, time trends in spawner abundances, and/or distribution of spawners among counting locations may be valuable. Although these indicators will only provide a partial assessment of CU status, it will be a first step towards a complete assessment, and may highlight priority CUs where further analyses and/or data are required.\nWe would like to thank Chris Wood, Michael Bradford, Michael Folkes, Neil Schubert, Steve Cox-Rogers, Jim Irvine, Ann-Marie Huang, Merran Hague (Fisheries and Oceans Canada), Jim Woodey (formerly with the Pacific Salmon Commission), Ian Guthrie (Pacific Salmon Commission) and Kendra Holt (Simon Fraser University) for their helpful advice.

APPENDICES\nAppendix A Status of Takla/Trembleur sockeye salmon according to various indicators grouped into four classes: spawner abundances, trends in abundance, distribution, and fishing mortality. Status is assessed relative to upper and lower benchmarks. Zone of status (Red, Amber, Green) is identified only for those metrics for which data and benchmarks are available. SRR is the stock-recruitment relationship. All other abbreviations are described in Table 5 and Table 6 in the text. See also Figs. A1-A5 below.\nSpecific metric: Spawner abundance, S, in the current year (and geometric mean of the most recent generation)\nLower benchmark Spawner abundances that would result in recovery to SMSY within one generation in the absence of fishing = 118,000\nReference Johnston et al., 2002\nUpper benchmark 80%SMSY = 316,000\nReference (Fisheries and Oceans Canada, 2009)\nCurrent status (2008): 29,835 (geometric mean of last generation, 2005-2008 = 27,371)\n47\nSpecific metric: Spawner abundance, S, in the current year (and geometric mean of the most recent generation)\nLower benchmark 20% of spawners at maximum recruitment estimated from freshwater production studies = 156,000\nReference Johnston et al., 2002; Shortreed et al., 2001 (capacity estimate)\nUpper benchmark 40% of spawners at maximum recruitment estimated from freshwater production studies = 312,000\nReference Approximately equivalent to SMSY, derived from equations in Table 5.\nCurrent status (2008): 29,835 (geometric mean of last generation, 2005-2008 = 27,371)\nSpecific metric: Spawner abundance, S, in the current year (and geometric mean of the most recent generation)\nLower benchmark S at X% of MSY recruitment (e.g., 50%= 137,000)"

The dashed vertical line is the mean of the prior distribution, the dotted line is the median of the posterior estimate of carrying capacity assuming a uniform prior (i.e., a relatively uninformative prior), and the solid line is the median of the posterior distribution including prior information. The mean of the prior distribution corresponds to the spawners at maximum smolt production estimated from freshwater production studies (77.9 104 fish). The spread (i.e., standard deviation) of the prior was chosen to envelope the minimum and maximum observed spawner abundances from 1991 through 2000 (33.2 104 and 108.6 104 fish, respectively, Shortreed et al. 2001).\n59\n\f700\n600\n500\ny c n e u q e r F\n400\n300\n200\n100\n0\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n140\nS M SY (10 000s of fish)\nFig. A 3.

The framework applies where\ndecisions on harvest strategies or harvest rates for a stock must be taken\non an annual basis or other time frame to determine Total Allowable Catch\nor other measures to control harvests. The framework applies to key\nharvested stocks managed by Fisheries and Oceans Canada; that is, those\nstocks that are the specific and intended targets of a fishery, whether in a\ncommercial, recreational or subsistence fishery. In applying the framework,\nall removals of these stocks from all types of fishing must be taken into\n\faccount. While application of this framework to key harvested stocks is the\nminimum requirement, it may be applied more broadly to other stocks\nwhere necessary and as circumstances warrant.\nThis decision framework is one part of an overall Sustainable Fisheries\nFramework for Canadian fisheries, which includes a number of other\npolicies and initiatives, completed or being developed, such as a Forage\nSpecies policy and a Sensitive Benthic Areas policy that together will\nprovide a more rigorous and comprehensive approach to managing\nCanada’s fisheries, factoring in ecosystem considerations and precaution.\nThe Sustainable Fisheries Framework applies, and all the policies pursuant\nto it apply, to fishery decisions on a stock by stock basis. This paper begins\nwith background on the PA (Precautionary Approach) in Canadian fisheries\nthen describes the elements of the decision framework and considerations\nfor applying it in a fishery.\nThe Precautionary Approach in Canadian Fisheries\nIn resource management, the PA (Precautionary Approach) is, in general,\nabout being cautious when scientific information is uncertain, unreliable or\ninadequate and not using the absence of adequate scientific information as\na reason to postpone or fail to take action to avoid serious harm to the\nresource.\nThe United Nations Agreement on Straddling and Highly Migratory Fish\nStocks (UNFA) , which came into force in 2001, commits Canada to use the\n2\nPA (Precautionary Approach) in managing straddling stocks as well as, in\neffect, domestic stocks. In 2003, the Privy Council Office, on behalf of the\nGovernment of Canada published a framework applicable to all federal\ngovernment departments that set out guiding principles for the application\nof precaution to decision making about risks of serious or irreversible harm\nwhere there is a lack of full scientific certainty.\n3\n\fIn 2004, the Atlantic Fisheries Policy Review (AFPR (Atlantic Fisheries Policy\nReview)) led by DFO (Fisheries and Oceans) called for a comprehensive risk\nmanagement framework for decision-making, which incorporated the PA\n(Precautionary Approach) and included the following elements:\nreference points linked to stock and ecosystem indicators;\nobjectives for desirable resource and fishery outcomes; and\nresource use strategies to scale resource use to its condition in a\nmanner that avoids undesirable outcomes\nOne of the main drivers for the AFPR (Atlantic Fisheries Policy Review)\nrecommendation on conservation was the stock declines that have\noccurred in recent decades in some groundfish fisheries.\nIn June 2005, DFO (Fisheries and Oceans) adopted the Wild Salmon Policy\nfor Pacific salmon , which incorporates a precautionary approach to\n4\ndecision-making. In May 2006, DFO (Fisheries and Oceans) Science released\na paper outlining the minimal requirements, from a science perspective, for\na harvest strategy to be compliant with the Precautionary Approach.\n5\nSAR\n2006-23 informs the basic elements of this framework\nComponents of the General Decision Framework\n6\nThe following are the primary components of the generalized framework:\n\nReference points and stock status zones (Healthy, Cautious and\n\nCritical). Table 1 illustrates the three stock status zones and includes\ngeneralized criteria for management actions for key harvested stocks.\n\nHarvest strategy and harvest decision rules.\nThe need to take into account uncertainty and risk when developing\n\nreference points and developing and implementing decision rules.\nReference Points and Stock Status Zones\n\fThe stock status zones are created by defining the Limit Reference Point\n(LRP (Limit Reference Point)) at the Critical:Cautious zone boundary, and an\nUpper Stock Reference Point (USR (Upper Stock Reference Point)) at the\nCautious:Healthy zone boundary and the Removal Reference for each of\nthe three zones. The three-zoned diagram below shows these different\nelements.\nThe LRP (Limit Reference Point) represents the stock status below which\nserious harm is occurring to the stock. At this stock status level, there may\nalso be resultant impacts to the ecosystem, associated species and a long-\nterm loss of fishing opportunities. Several approaches for calculating the\nLRP (Limit Reference Point) are in use and may be refined over time. The\nunits describing stock status will vary depending on the nature of the\nresource (groundfish, shellfish, salmonids or marine mammals). The LRP\n(Limit Reference Point) is based on biological criteria and established by\nScience through a peer reviewed process.\n\fUnder this framework, the USR (Upper Stock Reference Point) can perform\ntwo functions. First, in accordance with SAR 2006-023 the USR (Upper Stock\nReference Point) is the stock level threshold below which removals must be\nprogressively reduced in order to avoid reaching the LRP (Limit Reference\nPoint). For this reason, under this framework, the USR (Upper Stock\nReference Point), at minimum, must be set at an appropriate distance\nabove the LRP (Limit Reference Point) to provide sufficient opportunity for\nthe management system to recognize a declining stock status and\nsufficient time for management actions to have effect. Secondly, the USR\n(Upper Stock Reference Point) can be a target reference point (TRP (Target\nReference Point)) determined by productivity objectives for the stock, 7\nbroader biological considerations and social and economic objectives for\nthe fishery.\n8\nA TRP (Target Reference Point) is a required element under\nUNFA and in the FAO guidance on the application of the PA (Precautionary\nApproach), as well as ecocertification standards based on it, such those of\nthe Marine Stewardship Council and may also be desirable in other\nsituations.\nIn practice, the threshold point below which removals must be reduced to\navoid serious harm (USR (Upper Stock Reference Point)) can be different\nthan the TRP (Target Reference Point). However, it is essential that while\nsocio-economic factors may influence the location of the USR (Upper Stock\nReference Point), these factors must not diminish its minimum function in\nguiding management of the risk of approaching the LRP (Limit Reference\nPoint). In either case, the USR (Upper Stock Reference Point) would be\ndeveloped by fishery managers informed by consultations with the fishery\nand other interests, with advice and input from Science. As an illustration,\nthe diagram below shows the TRP (Target Reference Point) as distinct from\nthe USR (Upper Stock Reference Point).\n\fFor many stocks, setting the LRP (Limit Reference Point) and USR (Upper\nStock Reference Point), as well as a TRP (Target Reference Point), in\nbiomass terms is suitable, but other units (such as escapement for salmon,\nor yield for effort controlled fisheries) may be used to indicate stock status\nwhere appropriate. In data deficient cases, priority should go to monitoring\nthe stock and establishing data time series to support the identification of\nan LRP (Limit Reference Point). When developing reference points efforts\nshould be made to take into consideration the range of factors which may\naffect the productivity of the stock including changes in ocean conditions,\nwhere information is available.\nThe Removal reference is the maximum acceptable removal rate for the\nstock. It is normally expressed in terms of fishing mortality (F) or harvest\nrate. It could be described in ways other than F or harvest rate but it always\nmust be described in terms of fishery-related pressure that affects the\noverall stock. The Removal reference includes all mortality from all types of\nfishing. To comply with the UNFA, the Removal reference must be less than\n\for equal to the removal rate associated with maximum sustainable yield.\nBoth the previous diagrams illustrate how the Removal reference would be\nadjusted depending on the stock’s abundance and its location in the three\nstock status zones. In the Cautious zone, the adjustment of the Removal\nreference does not have to follow a linear relationship as shown in the\ndiagram but a progressive reduction in removals is required.\nReference points will usually be determined using standard biomass and\nharvest metrics. However, for a number of stocks, such measurements are\nnot available. In these cases, precautionary management actions should be\nbased on the estimates of productive potential and harvest that are the\nmost appropriate for the stock of concern and data available, with the\nobjective of avoiding serious harm to reproductive capacity of the stock.\nAnnex 1a elaborates on the cases where other indicators are used as\nreference points for a particular stock or fishery. Such actions aiming at\nconserving reproductive capacity could include the use of minimum harvest\nsizes (above size at first maturity), gear restrictions, and/or temporal or\nlocal closures. In these cases, reference points could be based on empirical\nmeasurements of reproductive potential (e.g. minimum egg per recruit for\nlobster).\nHarvest Rate Strategy and Harvest Decision Rules\nA harvest rate strategy is the approach taken to manage the harvest of a\nstock and is a necessary element of any fishery plan. In order to implement\nthe PA (Precautionary Approach) in a fishery, pre-agreed harvest decision\nrules and management actions for each zone, are essential components of\na harvest rate strategy.\nTable 1 provides generalized management actions to apply this decision\nframework to the management of key harvested stocks. Actual harvest\ndecision rules should be more precise and provide details on the harvest\n\frates and possibly other management procedures that are required in each\nzone or steps within a zone. The pre-agreed harvest decision rules and\nmanagement actions should vary in relation to the reference points, and be\ndesigned to achieve the desired outcome by affecting the removal rate. The\nremoval rate should take into account total removals from all fisheries.\nThey should be expressed in terms appropriate for the management\nsystem (e.g. effort controls for an effort based management system) and\ndo not need to be expressed in the same units as the LRP (Limit Reference\nPoint), USR (Upper Stock Reference Point) or Removal reference.\nSpecific values for individual stock harvest strategies are to be provided\nthrough science assessments. The development of decision rules is a\nManagement responsibility and Science’s role is to provide advice in\nsupport of their development. The harvest rate strategy, along with its\nassociated harvest rules, would take the form of a table and/or graph that\nshould be appended to the decision-making framework for each stock.\nAnnex 2a shows a general example of a harvest rate strategy for a fictional\nstock.\nThis framework provides guidance on developing reference points\nand harvest decision rules for key harvested targets stocks. However, the\napplication of the harvest decision rules in a fishery may need to be\ntempered to limit effects on other stocks. Management actions related to\nother ecosystem elements may also be considered when using the\ndecision-making framework based on available information.\nUncertainty and Risk\nAn important aspect of this decision framework is the treatment of\nuncertainty and risk when estimating stock status, reference points and in making and implementing management decisions. 9\n\fBoth scientific uncertainty and uncertainty related to the implementation of\na management approach must be explicitly considered and the\nmanagement decisions taken must be tempered when necessary to give\neffect to the PA (Precautionary Approach). Uncertainty should be\nincorporated in the calculation of stock status and biological reference\npoints. It is desirable that scientific uncertainty be quantified to the extent\npossible and used to assess the probability of achieving a target or of a\nstock falling to a certain level under a specific management approach.\nThe appropriate risk to consider when using this framework is the\nprobability of and the severity of the impact from management actions on\nstock productivity. In the framework, the management of this risk is\nexpressed by the identification and position of reference points, the\nchanging severity of management actions that are chosen as stock status\nchanges and the tolerance for stock declines.\nTo illustrate, in the Healthy zone, where economic considerations may\nprevail, stock reductions resulting from management actions with a low\nprobability of the stock falling to the Critical zone are tolerated because of\ntheir reduced impact on the integrity of the stock. In the Critical zone,\nconservation concerns are paramount and there is no tolerance for\npreventable declines. Decision rules developed for a fishery should reflect\nthese general principles.\nManagement decisions should be explicit about the risk of decline\nassociated with a management action by deciding on a risk tolerance for a\nparticular management decision (Annex 2b contains a draft table of risk\ntolerance designations). As an illustration, if a stock’s abundance is in the\nCautious zone, near the Critical zone, it may be decided that there is a low\ntolerance for a risk of the abundance declining from its current level.\nAccording to the table, a low tolerance for risk is where the risk of a stock’s\n\fdecline from its current level is estimated to be between 5% and 25%.\nManagement actions would then aim to be consistent with this level of risk\ntolerance.\nDefining growth criteria\nWhen a stock is in the critical zone, management actions must promote\nstock growth and removals by all human sources must be kept to the\nlowest possible level. However, the development of harvest decision rules\nshould also include defining growth criteria for the stock when it is in the\nCautious zone. These criteria are recommended as an element of a fully\nadapted stock-specific decision framework. They are a primary tool for the\nestablishment, with industry input, of an agreed growth trajectory for a\nstock toward recovery or other targets that are to be achieved within a\nspecified period and with a high probability.\nOptional Elements of the Framework\nStock trajectory\nWhen the stock is in the Cautious or Healthy zone, management actions\ncould be differentially considered on the basis of both stock status (e.g.\nabundance) and trajectory or rate of change in status, within the bounds of\nthe removal rate strategy appropriate for the status zone. For example,\nmanagement actions might appropriately vary if a stock is in the Cautious\nzone but clearly improving in status (e.g. growth in abundance), as\nopposed to declining sharply (e.g. decrease in abundance) through the\nsame status zone. Flexibility in management measures is limited in the\ncritical zone given that when the stock has reached this zone, priority must\nbe to keep all sources of mortality at the lowest possible level to get the\n\fstock out of the critical zone within a reasonable timeframe, according to\nthe rebuilding plan. Table 1 provides criteria for developing management\nactions in the Cautious and Healthy zones, based on trajectory of the stock.\nConsiderations for the Application of the Decision Framework\nTailoring the generalized three-zoned decision framework for an individual\nstock and applying it involves a number of steps, as outlined in this paper,\nfrom the determination by science of reference points and stock status in\nrelation to these points, to the development by fisheries management, in\ncollaboration with fishery interests, of a harvest rate strategy including pre-\nagreed decision rules for each zone of the framework.\nFor stocks that are currently not in a healthy situation, the identification of\nreference points and pre-agreed decision rules will contribute to the\nidentification of conditions that correspond to a healthy situation and the\nnecessary measures to reach such conditions. For stocks presently in a\nhealthy situation, reference points and decision rules will contribute to the\nidentification of conditions to avoid for a given stock or fishery and will\nguide decisions made in advance about the relevant measures necessary to\nmaintain the stock in a good situation, or the necessary adjustments that\nwill be required if the condition of the stock changes.\nThe scientific information available may vary substantially from one stock\nto another. Accordingly, different approaches must be used for calculating\nLRPs and defining harvest rules that take into account the information\ncurrently available for a given stock. Annex 1b contains reference points\nand harvest decision rules that may be considered as the best available\nguidance to assess the stock in relation to sustainability and to guide\nconservation, in the absence of existing stock or fishery specific\nprecautionary reference points and harvest decision rules.\n\fThe best metric available to identify the conditions where serious harm\ncould occur should always be chosen. For example, the metric used could\nbe based on spawning biomass or on a particular sex ratio for a given\nspecies that may increase the risk of impaired productivity. Similarly, a set\nof indices, concerning various aspects of a stock or fishery, could inform\nabout risks to productivity.\nIn general, as long as a time series as possible should be used in\nestablishing reference points for a stock. Many stocks will show substantial\nvariation in productivity over a long time series, and this variation should\nbe taken into account when setting the reference points. Scientifically\nsound ways have been established for dealing with the special cases when\nthis variation appears to be structured as periods of consistently high or\nlow productivity. These cases need to be evaluated individually, but as a\ngeneral rule the only circumstances when reference points should be\nestimated using only information from a period of low productivity is when\nthere is no expectation that the conditions consistent with higher\nproductivity will ever recur naturally or be achievable through\nmanagement.\nWhenever appropriate, management decisions and actions will take into\naccount socio-economic factors as well as biological. When a stock is in the\nHealthy zone, socio-economic considerations may prevail; in the Cautious\nzone, socio-economic and biological factors will be balanced to reflect the\nstock trajectory and location in the zone; and in the Critical zone, biological\nconsiderations will prevail.\nProducing a workable decision framework for a fishery will require the\nparticipation of fishery interests in all aspects of the process to develop the\nframework.\n\fThe various components of the framework for a fishery (i.e. the reference\npoints, removal references and decision rules) should be explicit enough to\nallow assessment or evaluation of the performance of the framework. Such\nan assessment or evaluation should be considered on a regular basis and it\nwould normally take place after there is sufficient experience with the\nframework to conduct a proper evaluation of its performance (a period of 6\n-10 years might provide enough time to gain appropriate experience with\nthe framework). However, the availability of any new information that\ncould have a significant impact on the application of the framework could\njustify an earlier evaluation of the framework and adjustments to it, if\nnecessary.\nFinally, the framework for a fishery and its components, as described in this\ndocument, should be considered as risk assessment tools that need to be\nreviewed periodically and that may be refined over time.\nStocks in the Critical Zone, Rebuilding Plans and Management Strategies\nIn the critical zone, management actions must promote stock growth and\nremovals from all sources must be kept to the lowest possible level until the\nstock has cleared this zone. There should be no tolerance for preventable\ndecline. When a stock has reached the critical zone, a rebuilding plan must\nbe in place with the aim of having a high probability of the stock growing\nout of the Critical zone within a reasonable timeframe. (This is referenced in\nTable 1). This plan must be associated with an appropriate monitoring and\nassessment of the condition of the stock to confirm the success of\nrebuilding. The plan must also include additional restrictions on catches,\nand a provision that application of the measures is mandatory if the\nevaluation fails to find clear evidence that rebuilding is occurring.\n\fThe development of a rebuilding plan should be initiated enough in\nadvance to ensure the plan is ready to come into effect at the boundary of\nthe Critical and Cautious zones if a stock has declined and reached the LRP\n(Limit Reference Point). Developing a rebuilding plan may take\nconsiderable time and this should be taken into account in deciding when\nto initiate the process. In some cases, a plan could be initiated when the\nstock declined past the mid-point of the Cautious zone. If a stock is already\nin the critical zone, a rebuilding plan must be developed and implemented\non a priority basis.\nWhen a harvested stock is in the critical zone below the LRP (Limit\nReference Point), long-term sustainable fishery benefits can only be\nrealized by emphasizing considerable restraint through the stock recovery\nphase. Stocks with very low abundance generally have poor productivity,\nand therefore, rebuilding is even more challenging. In these circumstances,\nconcerted action is required to ensure stock recovery occurs. While some\nflexibility may be found in the pace established to reach recovery\nobjectives, it is crucial that rebuilding strategies and rebuilding objectives\nare identified that are supportive of the PA (Precautionary Approach). In\nmany cases, rebuilding of a stock to more sustainable levels has to be seen\nin terms of a long time horizon.\nParticipation of Fishery Interests\nTo be successful, the utilization of this decision making framework\ngenerally and its application to the specific fisheries needs to be done in\nconcert with the fishing participants, to which it is applied, and with\nengagement of others with an interest, including Provinces, Territories,\nAboriginal people, wildlife management boards (as authorized under a land\nclaims agreement), processors and others. If effectively implemented in\nthis way, this approach will facilitate the stable and predictable business\nenvironment in the fishery that participants seek, while at the same time\n\fcontributing to sustainability. In fact, decision rules we are seeking to\nestablish are only likely to hold if they are developed in concert with its\nparticipants. This approach will also provide a stable framework for the\nadoption of an “ocean to plate” approach to fisheries management\nsupportive of long-term planning and engagement. Finally, involving\nfishing participants as partners and involving others through engagement\nfacilitates co-management interactions and shared stewardship.\nScope of Application\nAmong other things, the Policy is guided by the principle that the fishery is\na common property resource to be managed for the benefit of all\nCanadians, consistent with conservation objectives, the constitutional\nprotection afforded Aboriginal and treaty rights, and the relative\ncontributions that various uses of the resource make to Canadian society,\nincluding socio-economic benefits to communities.\nTable 1 - Three zone PA (Precautionary Approach) framework\nwith criteria for management actions for key harvested stocks\n10\nStock Status\nCritical\nCautious\nHealthy\nGeneral Approach\nConservation considerations prevail.

This plan must be associated with appropriate monitoring and assessment of the condition of the stock to confirm the success of rebuilding. The plan must also include additional restrictions on catches, and a provision that application of the measures is mandatory if the evaluation fails to find clear evidence that rebuilding is occurring.\n\fStock Status\nCritical\nCautious\nHealthy\nManagement actions should react to a declining trend that approaches the cautious boundary. Risk tolerance for preventable decline – moderate (if low in zone) to neutral\nDeclining Management actions must arrest declines in the short term or immediately if low in the zone. Risk tolerance for preventable decline – very low / low. Development of a rebuilding plan is ready to come into effect if the stock declines further and reaches the critical zone.\nAnnex 1a\nThe metrics that can be used in relation to the Precautionary framework\nIn the context of fisheries management, the limit reference point is the\nstock level below which productivity is sufficiently impaired to cause serious\nharm. The PA (Precautionary Approach) framework would normally be\n\fdescribed using units that relate directly to stock productivity. For stocks\nwith age-structured analytical assessments, the most direct measurement\nof stock productivity is usually spawning biomass or egg production.\nHowever, it is not always appropriate or possible to have as direct an index\nof productivity and hence of serious harm. There are many situations\nwhere spawning biomass is not estimated for a stock and the resource is\nmanaged on the basis of other indicators of stock condition such as catch\nrate indices and size/age profiles in the catch. Where necessary, other\nmetrics can and should be considered for use in defining serious harm and\nguiding decision-making in relation to stock condition.\nThe approach of using a suitable proxy for Spawning Stock Biomass (SSB)\nhas originally been mentioned in the science framework released in 2006.\nHowever, the use of the concept of “proxies” sometimes creates confusion\nand somehow the false perception that SSB is the only right indicator to\nidentify the productive capacity of a stock, any alternate indicator being a\nsecond best. The estimate of the reproductive/replacement potential must\nalways be based on the best information available and the approach\nretained must be the most appropriate for the stock of concern and data\navailable.\nThere are two challenges associated with the choice of the best metric to\nbe used. The first is to consider what index best represents the potential\nproductivity of the stock. The second is to consider what conditions,\ndescribed using this index, would constitute serious harm to productive\npotential (or ability to recover from the perturbation, if the concept of\n“productivity” did not apply for some reason) and to then define the\ndecision-making framework in relation to those conditions. For example, in\na case where the LRP (Limit Reference Point) cannot be derived from the\nhistory of the status of a stock (often because of the proper data were not\n\fcollected), the state from which a secure recovery has been demonstrated\nunder similar conditions might be the best scientific basis for estimating a\nlimit reference point.\nIn these cases, there may be added uncertainty about the actual position of\nthe LRP (Limit Reference Point). This uncertainty should be considered\n(among other factors) when locating the USR (Upper Stock Reference\nPoint). The greater the uncertainty about the degree to which the LRP\n(Limit Reference Point) actually reflects a condition associated with serious\nharm, the further away the USP should be set from the LRP (Limit\nReference Point).\nAnnex 1b\nGuidance to Identify Reference Points and Harvest Rules\nThe preferred approach is always to have reference points and harvest\nrules based on the best information available on stock biology and fishery\ncharacteristics while taking into account the limitations of the available\ndata. However, in some cases there may be insufficient information on\nwhich to base choices of stock-specific precautionary reference points and\nharvest rules. The following reference points are emerging from review and\nmeta-analyses of experience with a wide variety of fish stocks. They are in\nline with practices and standards used internationally, such as New Zealand\nand USA, and consistent with the language found in various international\nagreements. They are indicative of how the range of each stock status zone\nshould be characterized and, generally, where an LRP (Limit Reference\nPoint) and USR (Upper Stock Reference Point) should be situated along the\nspectrum of a stock’s potential status. In cases where insufficient stock-\n\fspecific information is available, these reference points may be considered\nas the best available guidance for management and for assessing the stock\nin relation to sustainability. Actual reference points for a stock may use\nother metrics and be set lower or higher than these references but should\nbe demonstrably appropriate for the stock and be consistent with the\nintent of the PA (Precautionary Approach). For example, the LRP (Limit\nReference Point) must be consistent with a point below which serious harm\nis occurring to the stock. Stocks that are not managed on the basis of\nbiomass and/or harvest rate controls should adapt the concepts in the\nreference points and harvest rules below to their particular circumstance,\nwhile respecting the basic tenants of the PA (Precautionary Approach) as\nset out in the general framework.\nStock Status\nIn critical zone.\nThe stock is considered to be in “the critical zone” if the mature biomass, or\nits index, is less than or equal to 40% of B\n.

Sixth Session, New York, 24 July – 4 August 1995, Article 6 and Annex II.\nCanada Privy Council Office, 2003. A Framework for the Application of Precaution in Science-based Decision-Making about Risk\nFor the purposes of applying the PA (Precautionary Approach) to decisions regarding the management of Pacific salmon stocks, Canada’s Policy for Conservation of Wild Pacific Salmon applies.\nDFO (Fisheries and Oceans) 2006. A Harvest Strategy Compliant with the Precautionary Approach. DFO (Fisheries and Oceans) Can. Sci. Advis. Sec. Sci. Advis. Rep. 2006/023.\nThis decision framework is consistent with the 1995 FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries and the 1996 FAO Technical Guidelines for Responsible Fisheries: Precautionary Approach to Capture Fisheries and Species Introductions.\n\f7\n8\n9\n10\nFor example, taking into account the importance of a prey species when determining appropriate abundance targets.\nLong term resource objectives can help to guide decisions and the design of harvest decision rules as well as serve as the basis for future reviews of decision-making, harvest rule and fishery performance. Guidelines will be developed for identifying long term resource and fishery objectives.\nFor the purposes of this paper uncertainty is defined as incomplete knowledge about the state of nature and risk is defined as the probability of an outcome multiplied by the level of impact of the outcome. In the framework, the probability component of risk is managed by establishing increasingly stringent management actions and lower tolerances for preventable decline as the stock moves from the Healthy zone, through the Cautious zone towards the Critical zone. The impact component is managed through the use of reference points, which are discussed in the paper.\nIn this framework, scientific uncertainty about stock status and/or stock trajectory must be explicitly considered when establishing decision rules and management actions. Where due to uncertainty, two or more status/trajectory combinations could be considered on the basis of the scientific advice provided, management actions from the more precautionary combinations should be followed.\n\f11\n12\n“Stable” may be interpreted as ‘no consistent trend’ to accommodate an appropriate degree of variability while in the Cautious and Healthy Zones only.\nA reasonable timeframe would normally represent the time for a cohort to recruit to the spawning biomass and then contribute to rebuilding the productive capacity of the stock. This period will vary among species. For many species, it will correspond to a period of 1.5 – 2 generations but it could be longer for long-lived species.\nDate modified:\n2009-03-23"

It defines a shared vocabulary and rules for how concepts relate.\nWhy conventions matter:\n\nConsistent terms and structure across contributors\nAutomated validation and processing\nInteroperability across systems\nFuture maintainability and extensibility\n\n\nOntology vs Knowledge Graph vs Graph Database\n\nOntology (Schema)\n\nFormal specification of concepts, relationships, and rules\nContains classes, properties, SKOS vocabularies, axioms, constraints\nPurpose: define the vocabulary and grammar for describing data\nExample: EscapementSurveyEvent class, usesEnumerationMethod property, SnorkelSurvey SKOS concept\nFile: dfo-salmon.ttl (schema only; no instance data)\n\nKnowledge Graph (Data)\n\nInterconnected instances conforming to the ontology\nContains specific facts, measurements, events\nPurpose: store actual data using the ontology’s vocabulary\nExample: SkeenaSnorkel2022_001 survey event with measurements\nFiles: separate data files (e.g., survey-data-2022.ttl)\n\nGraph Database (Storage)\n\nDatabase optimized for graph structures and queries\nStores schema + data for efficient traversal\nExamples: Jena TDB, Neptune, Blazegraph\n\nWhy this separation matters\n\nClean schema; 2) Independent versioning; 3) Reuse across datasets; 4) Easier maintenance/validation; 5) Interoperability\n\n\nWhy This Ontology?\n\nThe DFO Salmon Ontology provides a domain-fit semantic layer for Pacific salmon, enabling integration across stock assessment, genetics, and management, and supporting evidence transparency.\nSee: PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS.md for full purpose, objectives, and target users.\nWe build on:\n\nDarwin Core and the Darwin Core Conceptual Model (DwC-CM)\nNCEAS Salmon Ontology\nStandard vocabularies: QUDT (units), ENVO (environments), GBIF Backbone (taxa)\n\nDarwin Core Conceptual Model (DwC-CM): The Darwin Core Conceptual Model provides a semantic layer for Darwin Core that addresses long-standing ambiguities. DFO Salmon Ontology implements DwC-CM patterns:\n\nOccurrence redefined: Now explicitly “a state of an Organism in an Event” (resolves ambiguity)\nAssertion class: Modern replacement for MeasurementOrFact with clearer semantics\nStructured relationships: Better domain/range constraints and property usage guidelines\n\nDFO implements DwC-CM patterns, using dwc:Assertion for measurement classes and dwc:Occurrence for individual organism observations.\n\nBasic Modeling Approach\n\n\nOWL 2 DL for domain classes and properties\nSKOS 1.2 for controlled vocabularies/code lists\nRDF 1.2 Turtle (.ttl) for representation\nStart simple; modularize later as needed\nDwC-CM implementation: Uses modern Darwin Core patterns for improved interoperability\n\nDwC-CM Usage Patterns:\n\nFor Measurements: Use dwc:Assertion as superclass for all measurement classes\nFor Events: Use dwc:Event for survey events; use dwc:parentEventID for hierarchies\nFor Organisms: Use dwc:Organism for stocks; use dwc:Occurrence for individual observations (when applicable)\nFor Samples: Use dwc:MaterialEntity for physical samples\n\nOBO alignment\n\nFollow OBO Foundry principles where practical\nUse RO for relations where possible\nUse ROBOT for QC, conversion, release\n\nNext Steps\n\nContinue in docs/CONVENTIONS.md for “how we do things” (patterns, QA, tooling)\nConsult ADRs for rationale behind major decisions"

    "text": "Azure Data Bricks and the Azure Lakehouse\nAzure Databricks is a cloud-based analytics platform for big data processing, machine learning, and collaborative analysis. Built on Apache Spark, it integrates with Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS), Delta Lake, and Synapse Analytics, the core components of the Azure Lakehouse.\nIn this model, Databricks acts as the compute engine, running code while Data Lake Storage and Delta Lake handle scalable, secure data storage. Synapse Analytics adds SQL-based analytics and data warehousing.\nFor DFO, adopting the Lakehouse model eliminates siloed data storage and fragmented code management. Previously, datasets were scattered across systems, and essential data cleaning and analysis code was split across multiple GitHub repositories, making it hard to track, reuse, or standardize. Valuable intermediate data products were often inaccessible. The Lakehouse consolidates data, transformations, and curated datasets, improving collaboration, reproducibility, and transparency.\nNow, analysts can connect directly to the Lakehouse from RStudio (or any IDE) using PATs, gaining seamless, secure access to centralized data with scalable compute. This shift removes past limitations on data access, permissions, and technology use, significantly enhancing DFO’s analytical capabilities.\nThis guide walks through the setup process, enabling you to connect to Azure Databricks and analyze Lakehouse-stored data using RStudio for code execution, GitHub for version control, and the Lakehouse for data storage and sharing.",

Only use Databricks compute when you need to access new data, write data back to the Lakehouse, or run large-scale computations.\n\nWhen Databricks Compute is Used vs. Local Compute\nDatabricks Compute:\n\nRunning SQL queries and data processing tasks on the data stored in the Azure Lakehouse.\nAny operations that involve querying the data, such as dbGetQuery(connsql, “SELECT * FROM …”), are executed on Databricks compute resources.\n\nLocal Compute:\n\nWriting and executing R scripts that establish the connection to Databricks.\nProcessing the results returned from Databricks.\nManaging code with Git and GitHub from your local machine.\n\n\n\nTips to Minimize Databricks Compute Costs\nOptimize Queries: Write efficient SQL queries to minimize the amount of data processed and transferred to your local machine.\nUse Caching: Save data locally and don’t run dbGetQuery commands unless you are intentionally trying to get new data. Cache intermediate results when performing complex transformations to avoid redundant computations.\nFor example in R:\n\n# Query the data and save it to a variable\ndata &lt;- dbGetQuery(connsql, \"SELECT * FROM ...\") # Run the query only once or as needed for new data\n \n# Perform transformations on the data\ntransformed_data &lt;- data %&gt;% ...\n\n# Cache the transformed data\nsaveRDS(transformed_data, \"transformed_data.rds\")\n\n# Next time you need the transformed data, don't run the query again, instead load it from the cache or from your local copy\n\n# Load the transformed data from the cache\ntransformed_data &lt;- readRDS(\"transformed_data.rds\")\n\n# Continue working with the transformed data",

This allows you to leverage the version control and collaboration features of GitHub while working in Databricks.\nHowever, there are a few things to keep in mind when using a GitHub repo in Databricks:\n\nImporting Code: You can import code from a GitHub repository into a Databricks notebook by specifying the URL of the GitHub repository. Databricks will clone the repository and import the code into the notebook.\nCode Execution: When you import code from a GitHub repository into a Databricks notebook, the code is executed in the Databricks environment. This means that any data access or processing tasks will be performed on Databricks compute resources.\nCode Management: While you can import code from a GitHub repository into a Databricks notebook, you are not able to push code changes back to the repository directly from Databricks. If you need to make changes to the code, you will need to do so in the GitHub repository and then re-import the code into the Databricks notebook.",

    "text": "Accessing Open Data via ARCGIS REST\nThe arcpullr package is a great way to access ArcGIS REST services, which are often used for storing spatial data on Open Data. You can use the get_spatial_layer() function to retrieve a spatial layer from an ArcGIS server.\n\nExample: Pacific Recreational Fishery Salmon Head Depots\nThere can many URLs associated with each dataset. The “ArcGIS Rest URL” we need to feed into the get_spatial_layer() function should be the one that includes “arcgis/rest/services”.\nFor example, with the Pacific Recreational Fishery Salmon Head dataset, the URL we are interested in is https://egisp.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/arcgis/rest/services/open_data_donnees_ouvertes/pacific_recreational_fishery_salmon_head_depots/MapServer/.\nIf you have trouble tracking this down, go to the appropriate dataset page on Open Data.\nThen, under the Data and Resources section, find the item labelled ESRI REST (there is both an English and French example). Left click on the Explore dropdown item, then right click on Go to resource, and then left click on Copy link. This then copies the link to the URL you need.\n\n\n\ngoToResource\n\n\nIt is important to ensure the appropriate layer is specified. In this example, the “0” at the end of the address denotes the English version, while a 1 represents French (see layers within the MapServer page). They also do not always correspond to language. For example, in the Pacific Commercial Salmon In Season Catch Estimates dataset, layers 0 to 3 represent gill nets, troll, seine and Pacific Fishery Management Areas, respectively.\n\nsalmonDepots = get_spatial_layer(\"https://egisp.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/arcgis/rest/services/open_data_donnees_ouvertes/pacific_recreational_fishery_salmon_head_depots/MapServer/0\")\n\n\n\nCreating a map\nThere are some great packages to get basemaps in R. The rnaturalearth package is a good option for getting country borders and other geographical features. You can use the ne_countries() function to get country borders.\nIn British Columbia, rnaturalearth may not have the level of detail required (e.g., some islands are missing). The bcmaps package has a lot of detailed basemaps and spatial data for the BC coast, and the bc_bound_hres() function is particularly useful for mapping coastline.\nSince the data used in the tutorial are for the entire BC coast, rnaturalearth is used in the examples below.\n\n# Get coastline for North America \ncoast = ne_countries(scale = 10, returnclass = c(\"sf\"), continent = \"North America\") \n\nBecause the coastline basemap data span all of North America, it may be useful to crop the plot to the bounding box of the data (BC coast). The st_bbox() function from the sf package allows you to get the bounding box of a spatial object. You can use the xlim and ylim arguments in the coord_sf() function to set the limits of the x and y axes.\n\n# Define lat/lon bounds of your dataset\nbounds = st_bbox(salmonDepots)\n\nggplot()+\n  geom_sf(data = coast, fill = \"lightgrey\")+\n  geom_sf(data = salmonDepots, size = 3.5, aes(fill = ACCESSIBILITY___ACCESSIBILITÉ), pch = 21, alpha = 0.85)+\n  coord_sf(xlim = c(bounds[\"xmin\"], bounds[\"xmax\"]),\n    ylim = c(bounds[\"ymin\"], bounds[\"ymax\"]))+\n  # I'm not always convinced maps north arrows need to be added when the lat/lon is specified but some people insist!\n  # Add north arrow to the top right (tr) of the map. It points to \"true\" north, not magnetic north\n  annotation_north_arrow(location = \"tr\", which_north = \"true\",\n                         #height = unit(0.7, \"cm\"), width = unit(0.7, \"cm\"),\n                         style = north_arrow_minimal)+\n  # Also, scale bars shouldn't be added when you're this zoomed out, but here's how to add one anyway to the bottom left (bl):\n  annotation_scale(location = \"bl\", text_cex = 0.8)+\n  scale_fill_discrete(name = \"Accessibility\")+\n  theme_bw() # tidies up the visuals",

However, the Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) associated with each dataset remains unchanged.\nIn the Open Data portal, the UUID is the final part of the URL after “dataset”. For example, in the Pacific Recreational Salmon Head Depots dataset (https://open.canada.ca/data/dataset/3cc03bbf-d59f-4812-996e-ddc52e0ba99e), the UUID is 3cc03bbf-d59f-4812-996e-ddc52e0ba99e.\nTo make our script more robust, we can use the CKAN API. CKAN is a data management system that supports publishing, sharing, and discovering datasets. The ckanr package in R allows us to interact with CKAN-based portals, such as Open Data. You can use the ckanr_setup() function to establish a connection.\nInstead of hardcoding the ArcGIS REST URL in our script (which may change) we can use the CKAN API to reference the stable UUID. This allows us to dynamically retrieve the current ArcGIS REST URL associated with that UUID, ensuring our code remains functional even if updates occur.\n\nDownloading data\nWe’ll use the Pacific Recreational Fishery Salmon Head Depots data as an example. We can use the ckanr package to extract the ArcGIS REST URL by referencing the UUID.

    "text": "Sir Isaac Newton said, “If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.” As scientists, we aim to share our findings with colleagues who may use the information to continue to make progress on important questions. Making your data more transparent and reproducible not only contributes to a more useful body of work but provides “shoulders” for those who come after you (other colleagues, students, and collaborators). It’s also handy for improving your own workflow. Your personal peace of mind is another added bonus to front loading the work of organizing and describing your dataset.\nYou might be wondering what are we referring to when we talk about “Open Science”. A more open approach to research means making results accessible for the benefits of both scientists and broader society (UNESCO 2023). The Open Science movement aims to increase transparency and the speed of knowledge transfer. Barriers to Open Science include things like: paywalled journals, favouring knowledge produced by high-income countries, hidden or unknown source code or workflow, and supporting data that is unavailable or unusable. In this article, we’ll tackle the last barrier and talk about practical ways to make your data more Open.",

    "text": "2. Redundancy in data is OK sometimes!\nThroughout our scientific careers, we’re often told to be concise and simplify so this advice may surprise you. Strategic redundancy in data allows you to make linkages between different pieces of information. It also saves space. One way to invoke the hidden power of redundancy is using metadata and data dictionaries to link important context to your primary dataset. For example, this table contains two types of observations: song information and Billboard rankings with one entry (i.e., row) each week the song remains on the Billboard Hot 100. Look what happens when we split the information into two tables: one with the song titles, artists’ names and run times; and the other with details on their Billboard rankings. This:\n\nAvoids confusion at scale – note how there are two types of temporal data in the first table. One could conflate time and date.\nSaves space. Say there were 100 songs with an average of 7 entries each. Rather than a table with 700 entries and 7 variables (4900 pieces of data), you now have 2 tables (containing 4500 data points total). This difference in memory usage scales with the size of your dataset.\n\n Table 1. Too much information at different scales crammed into a single table. Table adapted from Wickham (2014).\n Table 2: Example of using redundancy by splitting tables in two. Note how one song (left) has multiple Billboard rankings (right). Tables adapted from Wickham (2014).",

    "text": "3. Keep raw data raw\nSeparating your raw data from analyses is essential for reproducibility. After all, how can we reproduce an analysis if we have no access to the original dataset? In repositories, create a folder named RAW. Place unmanipulated data here. Do not open these files except to add or remove raw data. You may consider setting them to “read-only” when viewing in Excel. Keep all analyses in your scripts and outside of Excel, which will read the data and create outputs from it. Use a descriptive file name for any outputs generated from raw data and place them in a separate folder.\nEmbracing Open Science practices doesn’t have to be overwhelming. By adopting tidy data formats, allowing for strategic redundancy, and keeping raw data untouched, you can contribute to a more transparent and collaborative scientific community and yourself up for smoother workflows and more reproducible research. These small, intentional steps can have a big impact, helping others build on your work and accelerating the pace of discovery.",

If not, you can still contribute by creating a pull request (PR) from your forked copy of the repo or creating an issue to request a change.\nWant to add a new documentation or tools page? Here’s how!\nYou can open the repo after cloning it in an IDE like RStudio or VSCode depending on your preference.\n\n\n\nAn IDE (RStudio or VSCode)\nGit SCM\nQuarto\n\n\n\n\nTo open the website locally, clone the repository with git by running git clone https://github.com/dfo-pacific-science/data-stewardship-unit.git in terminal in your IDE.\n\n\n\nMake a new branch so that you can test things out without messing things up in the main branch. Run git branch {branchName} in the terminal in your IDE to make a new branch and git switch {branchName} to switch to it.\n\n\n\nYou can create a new .qmd file in one of the four folders (how_to_guides, reference_info, tutorials, deep_dives) to get it displayed under the navbar menu, which grabs .qmd files automatically.\n\n\n\nIn terminal, run quarto preview. A browser window will pop up with a locally-hosted version of the website. Make sure your changes look good and progress to the next step. Make edits if needed.\n\n\n\nIn terminal, run quarto render. The complete site will be rendered in the _site folder for Github actions to deploy.\n\n\n\nRun git add {fileName} for all of the files you want to stage. Make sure to not forget the _free folder, which contains all of the information related to R code that runs in some of the .qmd’s.\nRun git commit -m \"commit message here\".\nRun git push. If you’ve never pushed on your current branch, git will prompt you to use something like git push --set-upstream origin {branchName}.\n\n\n\nCreate a pull request from your branch and assign a team member to review it. There are protections on the main branch that caution you away from pushing without a review. Once the PR has been merged to main, the Github Action will be automatically triggered. Check the actions tab to see the deployment progress.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse feature branches off the main branch if working on a larger update (e.g. fix/typo, add/new-tool-guide)\nOtherwise for small updates, commit directly to main or create your Pull Request directly from main.\nGroup related changes into one PR\nIf you’re fixing an Issue, mention it in your PR:\nCloses #42 will auto-link and close the issue on merge\nKeep commit messages short but clear and in present tense (\"Add how-to for bulk metadata upload\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse GitHub Issues to: - Request a new topic 📌 - Report a problem 🐛 - Share an idea 💡\nWe tag and triage regularly — feel free to assign yourself or ask for help!\n\n\n\n\nOpen an issue, ping someone on the DSU team, or check the README for more guidance.

Run git branch {branchName} in the terminal in your IDE to make a new branch and git switch {branchName} to switch to it.\n\n\n\nYou can create a new .qmd file in one of the four folders (how_to_guides, reference_info, tutorials, deep_dives) to get it displayed under the navbar menu, which grabs .qmd files automatically.\n\n\n\nIn terminal, run quarto preview. A browser window will pop up with a locally-hosted version of the website. Make sure your changes look good and progress to the next step. Make edits if needed.\n\n\n\nIn terminal, run quarto render. The complete site will be rendered in the _site folder for Github actions to deploy.\n\n\n\nRun git add {fileName} for all of the files you want to stage. Make sure to not forget the _free folder, which contains all of the information related to R code that runs in some of the .qmd’s.\nRun git commit -m \"commit message here\".\nRun git push. If you’ve never pushed on your current branch, git will prompt you to use something like git push --set-upstream origin {branchName}.\n\n\n\nCreate a pull request from your branch and assign a team member to review it. There are protections on the main branch that caution you away from pushing without a review. Once the PR has been merged to main, the Github Action will be automatically triggered. Check the actions tab to see the deployment progress."

By modeling terms and their relationships (broader, narrower, related), SKOS makes it easy to:\n\nMaintain consistent labels, definitions, and concept hierarchies.\nShare and integrate the vocabulary with other systems that understand RDF.\n\nThe vocabulary is intended to be a living document that evolves with the needs of the community. It is maintained by the Data Stewardship Unit (DSU) within the Fisheries and Assessment Data Section (FADS) in the Pacific Region of Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO).\nThe vocabulary is more than a simple glossary: it is a formally structured controlled vocabulary that uses the W3C-endorsed Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS), enabling machine-readable formats for integration into data systems, APIs, and web applications. For a deep-dive on the how and why of controlled vocabularies, see our guide: Support Controlled Vocabularies.",

Can. Sci. Advis. Sec. Res. Doc. 2012/106. v + 132 p.\nABSTRACT\nThe 24 Fraser Sockeye Conservation Units (CUs) were used as case studies to explore methods of status integration for Strategy 1 of the Wild Salmon Policy (WSP): Standardized Monitoring of Wild Salmon Status. Although most of these Fraser Sockeye case studies represent data rich CUs in the Pacific Region, with long time series of stock-recruitment data, a few CUs are also data limited (e.g. Chilliwack-ES only has some recent spawner abundance data).\nStatus integration was evaluated during a three day technical workshop, which included the development of both final integrated status for each Fraser Sockeye CU (which include one or more WSP status zones) and commentaries on the information used to assess status. For the workshop, two page standardized data summaries were produced for each Fraser Sockeye CU case study. Data summaries included WSP biological status information for a number of metrics (e.g. relative abundance, short-term trends in abundance, and long-term trends in abundance) and other biological data relevant to their interpretation. Case studies were evaluated ‘blind’, with generic labels rather than CU names. The decision to evaluate case studies ‘blind’ was made to facilitate the development of a standardized WSP status integration approach, to focus discussion on the metrics presented in Grant et al. (2011) for status integration, and to facilitate discussion between experts with detailed local and CU-specific knowledge and those with broader salmonid and status evaluation experience.\nEach CU case study was evaluated first in small group sessions (four to six participants per group) and, subsequently, in plenary sessions (all 34 workshop participants). On the final day of the workshop, the integrated status for each CU, developed in the previous days’ plenary sessions, were re-visited with the goal to narrow down a CU’s status to a final single status zone (where possible), and to fine tune commentaries. Also on the final day of the workshop, CU names were revealed to provide participants with the opportunity to introduce any specific supplementary information that might support a change in integrated status designation or that could be added to the CU status commentaries.\nIntegrated status results from this workshop complete WSP status determinations for Fraser Sockeye, which follows up on the recently published exploration of uncertainty in WSP status metrics for these CUs. Final statuses for the 24 Fraser Sockeye CUs included the following: seven Red, four Red/Amber, four Amber, two Amber/Green, five Green, one “Data Deficient”, and one “Undetermined”. Detailed status results amongst groups and expert commentary (which identified key metrics and associated data that guided these status determinations) are also summarized, and are necessary for CU status interpretation in WSP Strategy 4: Integrated Strategic Planning.\nAlthough each group moved through the CU summary information in different sequences, there was considerable similarity amongst groups regarding which considerations drove their final status determinations.\niv\n\fRÉSUMÉ\nLes 24 unités de conservation (UC) du saumon rouge du fleuve Fraser ont servi d’études de cas dans l’examen des méthodes d’intégration de l’état pour la Stratégie 1 de la Politique concernant le saumon sauvage (PSS) : Contrôle normalisé de la situation du saumon sauvage. Dans la plupart des études de cas portant sur le saumon rouge du fleuve Fraser, les UC de la région du Pacifique sont documentées par un riche ensemble de données, notamment des séries de données de stock-recrutement collectées de longue date; cependant, pour certaines UC, on dispose de peu de données (p. ex., seules quelques données récentes sur l’abondance des reproducteurs sont disponibles pour Chilliwack-DE).\nL’intégration de l’état a été évaluée pendant un atelier technique de trois jours, qui visait notamment à mettre au point les désignations d’état intégré définitives pour chaque UC du saumon rouge du fleuve Fraser (comprenant une ou plusieurs zones d’état de la PSS) et à commenter les renseignements utilisés pour évaluer l’état. Pour l’atelier, on a produit des sommaires de données normalisés de deux pages pour chaque UC du saumon rouge du fleuve Fraser. Ces documents contenaient des renseignements sur l’état biologique de la PSS pour plusieurs paramètres (p. ex., abondance relative, tendances de l’abondance à court et à long terme) et d’autres données biologiques pertinentes pour leur interprétation. Les études de cas ont été évaluées en aveugle et, pour ce faire, portaient des titres génériques et non le nom des UC. La décision a été prise d’évaluer les études de cas en aveugle pour élaborer une méthode normalisée d’intégration de l’état selon la PSS, pour axer la discussion sur les paramètres présentés dans Grant et al. (2011) aux fins d’intégration de l’état et pour faciliter la discussion entre spécialistes jouissant d’une connaissance précise de certaines UC en particulier et ceux ayant une expérience plus large des salmonidés et de l’évaluation de l’état.\nOn a d’abord évalué les études de cas de chaque UC dans des séances en petits groupes (quatre à six participants) et, par la suite, dans des séances plénières (avec les 34 participants à l’atelier). Le dernier jour de l’atelier, on a réexaminé l’état intégré de chaque UC, mis au point pendant les séances plénières des jours précédents, afin de réduire l’état de chaque UC à une seule zone d’état définitif si possible, et de préciser les commentaires sur l’état. Le dernier jour de l’atelier également, les noms des UC ont été présentés pour donner aux participants la possibilité d’ajouter toute information qui pourrait étayer la nécessité de modifier la désignation de l’état intégré ou que l’on pourrait ajouter aux commentaires sur l’état de l’UC.\nLes résultats relatifs à l’état intégré obtenus lors de cet atelier complètent les déterminations des états de la PSS pour le saumon rouge du fleuve Fraser, faisant suite à une analyse publiée récemment sur les incertitudes entourant les paramètres d’état de la PSS pour ces UC. Les états définitifs des 24 UC du saumon rouge du fleuve Fraser se répartissaient comme suit : sept Rouge, quatre Rouge/Ambre, quatre Ambre, deux Ambre/Vert, cinq Vert, un « Données insuffisantes » et un « Indéterminé ». Les résultats détaillés de l’état de chaque groupe et les commentaires des spécialistes (qui ont défini les paramètres clés et les données connexes ayant orienté la détermination des états) sont aussi résumés séparément et sont nécessaires pour interpréter l’état des UC dans la Stratégie 4 de la PSS.\nBien que chaque groupe ait pris connaissance des sommaires concernant les UC selon des séquences différentes, on a constaté une forte similitude entre les facteurs qui ont amené les groupes à déterminer les états définitifs.\nv\n\f1\nINTRODUCTION\nThe biological status of each Wild Salmon Policy (WSP) Conservation Unit (CU) is evaluated using a number of metrics (Holt et al. 2009), which could each indicate a different WSP status zone from Red (poor status) to Green (healthy status). For example, the WSP metric for recent trend in abundance could indicate a CU’s status is poor, while conversely, the long-term trend metric could indicate the same CU’s status is healthy. In cases where metric information is contradictory, provision of this metric-specific status information alone does not provide complete scientific advice to fisheries management. Instead, a final step that synthesizes all metric and status-related information into a final integrated status for each CU, and provides expert commentary on this information, is necessary as inputs into fisheries management processes to prioritize assessment activities and management actions (Table 1).\nA number of Action Steps identified for WSP Strategy 1 (Standardized Monitoring of Wild Salmon Status) have recently been completed, and the results from this work are foundational to this final status integration step. First, Pacific Salmon CUs, as the fundamental biological unit required to maintain salmon biodiversity, have been identified (Holtby & Ciruna 2007). Subsequently, a suite of metrics that fall into four classes of indicators (abundance, trends in abundance, distribution and fishing mortality) were recommended for WSP biological status evaluations (Figure 2; Holt et al. 2009); these WSP metric recommendations were based on analysis from a number of publications (Holt 2009; Porszt 2009; Holt 2010; Holt & Bradford 2011; Porszt et al. 2012). To assess each CU’s WSP biological status, a number of metrics are selected from this suite of possible metrics, depending on the data availability and applicability to a particular CU. Status for each selected metric is evaluated by comparing the biological state of the CU to metric-specific lower and upper benchmarks, which delineate, respectively, the Red (poor status) to Amber, and Amber to Green (healthy status) WSP status zones (Table 2; Figure 1).\nOne of the first groups of CUs to be evaluated under WSP Strategy 1 is Fraser Sockeye Salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) (Grant et al. 2011). Although most of these CUs are data rich, with long time series of stock-recruitment data, a few Fraser Sockeye CUs are also data limited (e.g. Chilliwack-ES only has some recent spawner abundance data). Wild Salmon Policy Strategy 1, Action Steps 1.1 (the identification of CUs), 1.2 (the development of criteria to assess CUs and identify benchmarks to represent biological statuses), and 1.3 (CU status assessment), were adapted and updated specifically for 22 current and 2 de novo Fraser Sockeye CUs (Grant et al. 2011). For Fraser Sockeye CUs, WSP indicators used to evaluate uncertainty in biological status included abundance (one metric) and trends in abundance (three metrics) (Grant et al. 2011). The relative-abundance metric, in particular, was evaluated across a range of benchmarks (estimated across different model forms and probability levels), which compared two different calculations of the average recent abundance (geometric versus arithmetic mean) against paired sets of upper and lower benchmarks. The fishing mortality class of indicator described in Holt et al (2009) was not used in Fraser Sockeye status evaluations, as this indicator is only used when abundance data are not available. In the case of Fraser Sockeye, however, all CUs have a relatively complete time series of escapement and recruitment data. The WSP distribution class of indicator comprises a CU’s freshwater spawning distribution only, and was not assessed for Fraser Sockeye because escapement enumeration methods generally do not provide the flexibility to assess distributional changes through time. Further, Fraser Sockeye CUs occupy a relatively small freshwater distribution, limited to their rearing lakes or spawning rivers, compared to species such as the Fraser Pink (odd year) CU that occupies the entire Fraser watershed (Holtby & Ciruna 2007). Therefore, current WSP\n1\n\fdistribution metrics are considered not as relevant to Fraser Sockeye CUs, compared to other species of Pacific salmon.\nSince several metrics (abundance and trends in abundance) were used to assess status for each Fraser Sockeye CU, and uncertainties in abundance benchmarks were considered (Grant et al. 2011), different metrics could indicate divergent biological statuses ranging from Red to Green, depending on the CU. Therefore, integration of the statuses for each metric and across uncertainties in abundance benchmarks for each Fraser Sockeye CU is a useful final step in Strategy 1 (Action Step 1.3: CU status assessment).\nFor Pacific Salmon CUs, WSP biological status integration methods have not previously been developed. Although other organizations also integrate biological status across multiple criteria, such as the Committee of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) and the World Conservation Union (IUCN), their approaches are not specific to Pacific Salmon and, therefore, rely on different criteria (i.e. metrics) to assess status, and use a combination of status designation guidelines and expert judgment to assign a risk category. Within DFO, a synoptic approach is being developed to use similar (but not identical) metrics to the WSP to assess the status of all 450+ CUs simultaneously. This approach does not make any definitive conclusions on status, but rather is a rapid prioritization tool. Since the synoptic assessment statuses are not equivalent to WSP statuses, and integration approaches are designed to be rapid and automatic, these approaches cannot be applied to the more comprehensive WSP status assessments. Another project, which specifically explores WSP status integration, is being conducted as part of a thesis project through the School of Resource and Environmental Management at Simon Fraser University (E. Brunet, SFU, pers. comm.). The goal of this thesis project, however, is not to develop decision rules for WSP status integration or to integrate status for specific CUs, but to use broad hypothetical scenarios to evaluate expert choice when integrating status across metrics.\nIn the absence of existing WSP-specific status integration approaches, a Canadian Science Advisory Secretariat (CSAS) technical workshop (comprised of Pacific Salmon Stock Assessment experts) was conducted to explore WSP status integration using Fraser Sockeye CUs as case studies. An additional goal of the workshop was to finalize integrated statuses for the 24 Fraser Sockeye CUs. For each CU, the final integrated status could include one status zone, or a combination of status zones, and commentary on the information used to assess status. The current paper provides the following details on WSP status integration using Fraser Sockeye CUs as case studies:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatus Integration Workshop design process;\nfinal Status Integration Workshop approach;\nstandardized data summaries used for the status integration workshop process;\nFraser Sockeye CU integrated status designations;\nFraser Sockeye CU status commentaries;\nbroadly applicable guidelines for interpreting status information for Pacific Salmon CUs;\nstatus integration recommendations for future processes;\nThis Research Document and the associated Proceedings (DFO 2012 a) and Science Advisory Report (DFO 2012 b) are intended to document the workshop planning process and what transpired specifically at the workshop (e.g. results, recommendations, etc.). Therefore, any commentary relating to aspects that were not recorded or discussed in plenary sessions at the workshop itself could not be addressed within the context of this paper (e.g. proposed additional analyses).\n2\n\f2\nMETHODS\n2.1\nINTERNAL DFO MEETING: INITIAL SCOPING EXERCISE\nIn preparation for the WSP Status Integration Workshop, a preliminary internal (DFO) meeting was held to explore WSP status integration using six unnamed Fraser Sockeye CUs as case studies. The six case studies represented the range of metrics used and statuses observed for the 24 Fraser Sockeye CUs presented in Grant et al. (2011). This meeting was not intended to provide final integrated statuses for these six CU case studies, nor develop a set of decision rules for status integration, but rather explore tools and approaches to biological status integration. The scoping meeting was held at the Pacific Biological Station on June 10, 2011 and included 15 DFO participants with technical expertise on Pacific Salmon stock assessment.\nPrior to the small internal status integration meeting, interviews were conducted by meeting organizers to familiarize participants with the standardized data summaries produced for each of the six CU cases, and to solicit feedback on WSP status integration methods. Data summaries included the standardized presentation of WSP metrics and population abundance trends for each CU. At the meeting, each participant was assigned to one of three groups (5 participants per group). Each group independently worked through each case study to assign an integrated status, and to record the rationale for their final status. The meeting ended in a broader group discussion on each group’s final status for each CU case study, and the similarities and differences in their status designations and approaches.\nParticipants agreed that the general meeting approach, using independent group work paired with broader full group plenary sessions, worked effectively to generate integrated CU statuses, and to begin to develop guidelines for status integration. Despite the variety of integration approaches used by groups, final CU statuses amongst groups converged for four out of the six CUs. For the integrated statuses developed at this meeting, groups used a combination of the individual metric results and information on abundance and productivity trends presented in the data summaries. No one metric alone was used to determine an overall status designation. For future integration processes, participants flagged a number of issues specifically related to the relative-abundance metric. First, appropriate estimation of benchmarks using model forms that consider separately, time varying productivity (i.e. Kalman filter Ricker model and smoothed Ricker model) and delay-density interactions (i.e. Larkin model), were questioned by participants. Second, the appropriate method to estimate the current abundance state of a CU (different methods of averaging the most recent four years of escapement data), used for the evaluation of abundance metric status, was also debated. As a result, meeting participants recommended further work on relative-abundance-metric benchmarks and methods for averaging current state of the CUs abundance. In addition, participants also recommended the inclusion of two additional metrics, productivity trends and absolute abundance, not included in the original WSP status evaluation toolkit (Holt et al. 2009), in future status integration processes. Overall, this smaller meeting provided the foundation for the CSAS Workshop using all 24 Fraser Sockeye CUs as case studies.\n2.2 WORKSHOP ORGANIZING COMMITTEE\nTo build on momentum established in the smaller internal DFO meeting that explored WSP status integration, an internal organizing committee was subsequently established to support planning for the WSP Status Integration CSAS Workshop. The organizing committee included representatives from two broad categories: senior management in DFO Science and Fisheries Management sectors, and technical experts on Pacific Salmon stock assessment. Members of the organizing committee represented 11 out of the 34 workshop participants. A total of six half\n3\n\for full-day planning meetings occurred from September 7 through to November 11, 2011, and these meetings varied from process to technically-oriented, drawing on different components of the organizing committee complement.\nFrom a process perspective, key issues that were addressed by the organizing committee included the following: identification of a workshop Chair, dates, venue, invitees, terms of reference, agenda, broader WSP communication pieces (e.g. biological benchmarks versus reference points, WSP Strategy 1, linkages to other WSP Strategies) and linkages to similar status processes (DFO synoptic survey, COSEWIC status designation process, and Simon Fraser’s E. Brunet’s thesis on WSP status integration).\nFrom a technical perspective, key issues addressed by the organizing committee included the following: design of the standardized data packages for each CU, information included in participant binders, workshop posters, and presentations, and issues previously flagged by DFO internal status integration meeting participants on the relative-abundance metric (e.g. identification of cyclic CUs, use of Larkin model-derived benchmarks for cyclic CUs, and the appropriate approach for averaging recent generation abundances for comparison to benchmarks).\n2.3\nPRE-WORKSHOP INTERVIEWS\nPrior to the CSAS workshop, participants were offered a pre-workshop interview. Through the interviews, participants learned exactly what to expect from the workshop (format, available data, and templates to be used), and organizers found out what to expect from participants (e.g. concerns about process and questions about technical details). The main advantage of conducting pre-workshop interviews was to minimize the time spent at the workshop orienting participants to background materials and process, in order to focus workshop time on the actual status evaluations. Interviews were also an additional communication tool, which was built upon using other media (posters, binder tabs, and presentations) at the actual workshop.\nPrior to the interview, participants received via email six electronic PDF files, which included the following:\n\na workshop outline: one page on the general approach of break-out group and plenary\n\nsessions to evaluate status integration methods and final Fraser Sockeye CU integrated statuses;\n\nStatus Integration Workshop Terms of Reference (See Appendix A in DFO 2012 a);\ncase study template: standardized information sheet to be filled in by each group during\n\nthe break-out group session, to document their status integration decision-making process (see Appendix E of DFO 2012 a);\n\nstatus results template: used by meeting organizers to record final status integration results, which include individual group statuses, final plenary status, and rationale for status (see Appendix F of DFO 2012 a);\nexample CU (unnamed) data summary: to provide participants with an idea of data\n\nsummary format and information;\n\nguide to data summary: provides a ‘road map’ describing the information presented in\n\nthe data summaries (Appendix 1).\nFor consistency amongst participant interviews, and also to facilitate synthesis of pre-workshop feedback provided by participants, most interviews were conducted by the same workshop organizer. Each interview generally followed the same order in which the documents are\n4\n\fpresented above (from 1 to 6), although the order and emphasis varied depending on the specific interests of each participant. The following questions were specifically asked of participants during their interviews: 1) how should status assessments be combined across different metrics and model assumptions; 2) how should uncertainty in abundance metrics be considered (e.g. alternative estimates of lower benchmarks); 3) how should data quality be considered in the status evaluation; and 4) how should additional information be considered in status integration? Participants’ responses were recorded by the interviewer and provided to each participant after their interview for their review.\nFeedback received through pre-workshop interviews greatly assisted the organizing committee with planning for the workshop. In general, respondents raised many of the same issues that were debated at the internal DFO meeting in June, and that would later come up again as challenges at the workshop. Based on responses in the pre-workshop interviews, the organizing team revised the case study data summaries, prepared additional background presentations for delivery at the workshop to clarify commonly raised question, and developed supplementary reference materials (see DFO 2012 a). The responses also helped the meeting Chair with preparing facilitation strategies.\nThe following process-related issues came up consistently during the interviews:\n What are the next steps following the status integration workshop? Specifically, what happens with the results of this workshop, and how frequently will status be re- assessed?\n\n\n\nClarification on the difference between assessing current CU status, which incorporates a variety of information (e.g. uncertainty in estimates of biological benchmarks), and choosing a single formal benchmark for subsequent management process (such as the development of management reference points) was required. This workshop dealt with status evaluation only.\nA few respondents questioned the use of ‘blind’ case studies, suggesting that knowing the name of each CU up front is important to the status integration process.\nConsistency in integrated status approaches was a recurring concern amongst participants interviewed. Specifically, there were concerns regarding how consistent integrated status designations would be between the current and future expert assessment groups and also between the current WSP integration approach and other assessment processes (particularly COSEWIC, given WSP lower benchmarks are set to include a buffer to COSEWIC designations).\nThe following technical issues were raised consistently during the interviews:\n\n\nThe broader applicability of the status integration approaches developed in the workshop was also questioned by respondents, since Fraser Sockeye CU data availability and analytical effort are high compared to most other Pacific Salmon CUs.\nRespondents also questioned how additional information (e.g. productivity pattern, total recruits pattern, habitat condition, exploitation rate, etc.), in addition to WSP metric- specific status information, would be used to develop integrated statuses.\n2.4\nSTANDARDIZED CU DATA SUMMARIES\nFor the workshop, two-page standardized data summaries were produced for each Fraser Sockeye CU (Appendices 1 & 2). Data summaries represented a critical step in the status integration process, by standardizing status-related information presented for each CU. Other\n5\n\fdetailed information on CU biology or CU-specific habitat and/or ecosystem threats was excluded from these data summaries (and, therefore, from Fraser Sockeye CU status integration). This level of detail was considered by the workshop organizing committee unnecessary for WSP Strategy 1 status evaluations, but instead may be a requirement for the subsequent processes when more detailed assessments may be conducted (Table 1). The presentation of the information deemed critical by workshop organizers to status evaluations was optimized within a two-page data summary lay-out (see Appendix 1 for guide to data summaries). Constraining data summaries to two pages and using a consistent lay-out of status-related information across CUs, ensures the integration processes is efficient (participants only have to learn the lay-out once when they work through the first CU case study), and standardized (depending on data availability, the same pieces of information are provided for each CU).\nData and status results were updated from Grant et al. (2011) to include 2010 escapement information. These data summaries included the following (see Appendices 1 & 2):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstatus information for up to four WSP metrics: one metric for abundance relative to biological benchmarks, one metric for long-term trend in abundance, and two metrics for short-term trend in abundance (note: relative-abundance metrics could not be evaluated for CUs without recruitment data or carrying-capacity data)\npresentation of both structural (i.e. model form) and stochastic (i.e. unexplained recruitment variation) uncertainty in estimates of biological benchmarks and the resulting uncertainty in the status indicated by the relative-abundance metric\npresentation of relative-abundance metric statuses evaluated using either geometric or arithmetic averages of recent abundances\nqualitative summary of overall data quality\ntime series plots of productivity (recruits/spawner and time-varying estimates of the Ricker model productivity parameter)\ntime series plots of spawner escapements\ntable of absolute abundances relative to COSEWIC criteria D1 for small populations\nretrospective (historical) time series of status for each WSP metric\nsupplementary plots included fishing mortality and total recruits\nData summaries were revised from the earlier version used at the June 2011 internal DFO status integration meeting, based on recommendations from participants at this internal meeting, feedback from pre-workshop interviews with participants, and subsequent organizing committee discussions. Key changes to the data summaries included treatment of salmon escapement data used in both the figures of abundance trends and in the methods used to average current escapements for the relative-abundance metric. Additional revisions to the data summaries included the addition of absolute abundance and productivity trends data and updates to the benchmark results for cyclic CUs.\nWorkshop organizers agreed that Pacific salmon abundance data are lognormally distributed, with spawner escapements occurring most frequently at low to moderate abundances relative to the less frequent very large abundances. Therefore, the appropriate way to view this data is in loge scale, which down weights the less frequent large abundance years visually in plots. Plotting salmon escapement data in loge space, therefore, does not mislead the analyst into over-emphasizing the infrequent large escapement years when interpreting abundance trends. However, in addition to presenting loge scale escapement in the data summaries, natural scale\n6\n\fplots were also included to avoid road blocks for workshop participants not familiar with working in loge space and to visualize the full magnitude of fluctuations over time.\nFor abundance metric status evaluations, Holt et al (2009) recommended using the geometric mean of the current generation escapement, rather than the arithmetic mean. Similar to plotting abundance data in loge scale, geometric averages are also considered more appropriate for summarizing log-normally distributed salmon abundance data. Although geometric versus arithmetic means of recent escapements are similar to one another for non-cyclic CUs, comprised of four consecutive years of relatively equal abundance, means of cyclic CU recent escapements (comprised of four consecutive years of very different abundances), are quite different between approaches. In particular, geometric means produce much lower averages compared to the arithmetic mean for cyclic CUs. There remain some questions regarding the differences in averaging four years of salmon abundances, where each year represents a relatively separate population of the same CU, rather than four unique years of changing total CU abundance. For comparison, many other species populations are spatially, not temporally isolated, and the total population is represented by the sum of all populations. For Pacific Salmon, perhaps the temporally separated populations should be similarly summed, although more work is required to address this.\nIn addition to discussion regarding appropriate data treatment for Fraser Sockeye CUs, the model form (i.e. Larkin model) specifically used to describe population dynamics for the cyclic CUs was also updated. Although the Larkin model has been recommended to describe population dynamics for cyclic CUs more appropriately than the typically used Ricker model, appropriate estimation of relative-abundance-metric benchmarks has been challenging given the complexity of the Larkin model, compared to the Ricker model. Larkin derived relative- abundance benchmarks were not provided in Grant et al. (2011), due to these computational challenges, however, further work was conducted in preparation for the workshop, and these benchmarks were included for specific CUs. Larkin-model derived benchmarks were provided at the workshop for seven CUs identified as cyclic.\nThese CUs for the set of cyclic case studies were selected based on a combination of three considerations: relative goodness-of-fit for Larkin-type models compared to Ricker-type models, expert opinion on the life history of each CU, and visual inspection of the observed patterns in abundance. Our classification into seven highly cyclic CU and 17 non-cyclic CUs was considered a pragmatic approach by the DFO stock assessment biologists & scientists who participated in the workshop planning process, and is supported by the following additional considerations:\n The question asked of participants was a broad one “How does a highly cyclic pattern in abundance affect your interpretation of status information?” rather than the more narrow “Which SR model fits best for this CU, and what is the appropriate method for estimating a lower benchmark based on this SR model?” For example, the challenges of interpreting short-term trends, identifying a meaningful measure of generational average, or comparing observed abundances to small population benchmarks identified by COSEWIC are similar for these 7 cyclic CUs, and were much less pronounced for the other 17 CUs, regardless of SR model fitting results.\n The relative weight of evidence for Ricker-type models or Larkin-type models has been explored in numerous publications (e.g. Walters & Staley 1987, Walters and Woodey 1992, Cass and Wood 1994, Ricker 1997, DFO 2006, Peterman and Dorner 2011 & 2012), but the number of stocks where Larkin-type models fit best depends on both the length of time series and the model variations used. For example, Cass and Wood (1994) identified 8 of 19 stocks as best described by a Larkin-type model, but a more\n7\n\frecent analysis by Peterman and Dorner (2011 & 2012), which included the large returns in the early 2000s, found that a non-stationary Larkin model fit best for 12 of 19 stocks ,\nFinally, an absolute abundance metric and updated CU productivity (recruits per spawner) trends was added to the data summaries. There are a number of Fraser Sockeye CUs that do not have recruitment data and therefore, relative-abundance metrics could not be evaluated. Since no absolute abundance metrics have been provided in the WSP status evaluation toolkit (Holt et al. 2009), absolute abundance for all Fraser Sockeye CUs was presented in the data summaries relative to COSEWIC Criterion D1 for small populations. Although productivity trends were presented in the previous version of the data summary, high (&gt;25 recruits/spawner) productivity values were highlighted in figures (shaded grey) as potentially unrealistic and likely artefacts of data issues.\n2.5\nCSAS WSP STATUS INTEGRATION WORKSHOP FORMAT\nStatus integration, using Fraser Sockeye CUs as case studies, was evaluated in a three-day workshop that included the development of final statuses for each CU (which could include one or more WSP status zones) and commentaries for the data used to assess status. In addition, integration approaches were explored. Workshop participants included technical experts that represented several specific stock assessment areas of expertise: Fraser Sockeye CUs, other Pacific salmon CUs, fisheries management, and broader salmon research. Internal participants and external university researchers were selected by organizers to encompass this broad range of expertise. In addition, First Nations groups, non-governmental organizations (NGO’s), and commercial and recreational fishing sectors were also contacted to solicit their recommendations on technical participation.\nPrior to the workshop, most participants received a pre-workshop interview to review the meeting outline, the data summary layout (see preceding Data section) of one example case study (unnamed CU), and to provide feedback to organizers. During registration, when participants first arrived at the workshop, binders were provided to each participant containing supporting information in a number of tabs: Tab 1: Workshop agenda; Tab 2: WSP general background; Tab 3: WSP Strategy 1 technical background; Tab 4 COSEWIC Criteria; Tab 5: workshop presentations; Tab 6: guide to CU Data Summaries. The subsequent three tabs were left blank for three case study sets (comprised of CU standardized data summaries, and blank templates to fill out as groups work through their CU-by-CU integrated status and commentary), which were provided to each participant immediately prior to the start of each break-out session (see Appendix 2 for data summaries provided for each CU):\n Case Study Set 1- Exploring Diversity: this set included six non-cyclic CUs that illustrate the diversity of scenarios (i.e. conflicting messages from different metrics and differences in data availability).\n Case Study Set 2 – Striving for Consistency: this set included 11 non-cyclic CUs broken\ninto two similar batches.\n Case Study Set 3– Making Sense of Cycles: this set included seven cyclic CUs that have exhibited persistent four year patterns of abundance; for these cases a unique model form was used to estimate abundance metric benchmarks.\nCase Study Sets 1 & 2 included non-cyclic CUs that comprise the greatest number of Fraser Sockeye CUs (17 out of 24) and are most similar to other Pacific salmon CUs; non-cyclic CUs do not exhibit persistent four year patterns in abundance. In contrast, Case Study Set 3, included the seven out of 24 Fraser Sockeye CUs that exhibit relatively unique four year cyclic patterns in abundance (see end of section titled ‘Standardized CU Data Summaries’ for CUs\n8\n\fidentified as cyclic and rationale for this choice by the Workshop Organizing Committee). One well known example of a cyclic CU is Late Shuswap (Adams River Sockeye), which exhibits one large dominant cycle, followed by one smaller subdominant cycle and two weak cycles. Since cyclic CUs presented particular status integration challenges in the previous internal DFO workshop, due to their unique population dynamics and their use of specifically a unique (Larkin) model form in relative-abundance-metric benchmark estimation, these cases were placed at the end of the non-cyclic CU case study sets in the workshop schedule. This order was implemented (i.e. completing all non-cyclic CU case studies, prior to the cyclic CUs) so that groups could build their confidence in status integration while establishing their integration approaches, and to maintain workshop momentum as each CU’s status integration was sequentially completed.\nEach workshop participant was assigned to one break-out group (four to six participants per group) for the duration of the workshop. Each group was organized to include a diversity of expertise that covered Fraser Sockeye stock assessment exerts, other Pacific salmon stock assessment experts, external technical experts, and broader research scientist expertise. In addition, at least one member of the DFO workshop organizing committee was assigned to each group, to provide assistance to the group process, where required. Groups worked through each case study set to develop both integrated single status designations (where possible) and commentaries for each CU, and consistent integration approaches. Participants were instructed to not spend time evaluating the details in the underlying information or data presented, as this was previously reviewed in a separate CSAS process and results published in Grant et al (2011). Case studies were evaluated ‘blind’, with generic labels rather than CU names, to facilitate the development of a standardized WSP status integration approach which would be broadly applicable to other CUs (see Discussion for more details on why ‘blind’ approaches were adopted for this process).\nFor each CU, groups first recorded their integrated status on one-page templates provided for each CU (see Appendix E in DFO 2012 a). On these sheets they also indicated whether or not these integrated statuses were either group consensus (i.e. each group member agreed with their final integrated status) or were provisional (i.e. discrepancies amongst group members regarding their integrated status or group members agreed to a single integrated status with some provisions). In addition, groups also recorded the main factors (i.e. which particular metric or supplemental information) that contributed to their integrated status, comments on their group’s status integration process, and, in cases where the status was provisional, an explanation of why. Groups also simultaneously recorded their integrated statuses on large tables in poster format located at the front of the room, organized by CU (rows) and group number (columns). Following each break-out group session, a plenary session with all 34 participants was conducted to record electronically, and in workshop minutes, individual group integrated statuses for each CU in the case study set, commentaries, and integration approaches, and to facilitate early discussions on across-group status integration and commentaries.\nOn the final day of the workshop, integrated statuses for each CU, developed in the previous day’s plenary sessions, were re-visited with the goal to narrow down groups’ individual integrated statuses and, as a consequence, a CU’s status to a final single status zone where possible. However, if single status determination was irreconcilable between groups for certain CUs, the final integrated statuses could include the multiple status zones agreed to by the full group at the final plenary session. Also on the final day of the workshop, CU names were revealed to provide participants with the opportunity to introduce any specific supplementary information relevant to a CUs WSP status that could be used to rationalize a change to the integrated status or that could be added to the CU status commentaries.\n9\n\fA number of workshop details were implemented to ensure workshop productivity and efficiency. A detailed workshop agenda was provided to participants, which presented the timing of case study break-out group and plenary sessions, and breaks (see Appendix B in DFO 2012 a). Given the work being conducted by participants was challenging and required sustained efforts over a three day period, the agenda also included some quick presentations of optical illusions and trivia questions (scores were kept for first group to answer the trivia correctly over the three day workshop, and prizes were presented to the winning group on the last day of the workshop). Groups selected unique names, from a suite of possible Latin species names, with the subsequently revealed common names used for group identification in the workshop. For each case study set, blank tables were displayed at the workshop in large poster format, organized by CU (rows) and group number (columns). As groups completed their integrated statuses for a CU, they were instructed to place a coloured sticky note (Pink representing the Red status zone, Yellow representing the Amber status zone, and Green representing the Green status zone) in the appropriate row and column, representing, respectively, the CU and their group. The poster approach was used to demonstrate progress on CU status integration to participants, during this long and demanding process, and also to facilitate early comparisons of integrated statuses between groups. The workshop Chair ensured agenda timelines were adhered to and, in conjunction with three meeting facilitators, led plenary sessions to develop integrated statuses, status commentaries, and to record status integration decision rules. Group integrated statuses recorded in poster-format, were photographed and later copied into an electronic excel files. Final integrated statuses and commentaries agreed to by the full group were recorded in an electronic summary table projected at the front of the room during the final plenary sessions. A rapporteur was also assigned to the meeting to record a transcript of the meeting proceedings.\nAlso to ensure workshop productivity, workshop organizers identified several important communication pieces necessary to facilitate the workshop process. To remind participants of specific elements required for the status integration process, select details were synthesized from a number of publications (DFO 2005; Holtby & Ciruna 2007; Holt et al. 2009; Holt 2009; Porszt 2009; Holt & Bradford 2011; Grant et al. 2011), and presented to participants using a variety of communication tools: pre-workshop participant interviews, workshop posters, presentations, and participant binders (see DFO 2012 a for details). A ‘Common Look Common Feel’ approach was also adopted to assist with communication, which used consistent templates for the presentation of background material across media. Specific communication pieces were developed to include the following: background on the WSP (Goal and Strategies) and, specifically, Strategy 1 (Standardized Monitoring of Wild Salmon Status); the definitions of Red, Amber and Green WSP biological status zones; why status integration was required to complete WSP Strategy 1, and how these integrated status results link to subsequent WSP Strategies (particularly Strategy 4: Integrated Planning); the difference between biological benchmarks (the focus of the workshop) versus management reference points (focus of subsequent WSP Strategy 4 and related management processes); technical details regarding the data summary lay-out and metrics selected in Grant et al. (2011); specific direction to participants that the workshop purpose is not re-visit details in Grant et al. (2011), but to rather focus on the status integration step; and description of comparisons of WSP status integration work to similar biological status process both internal and external to DFO.\n10\n\f3\nRESULTS\nThe Status Integration Workshop addressed both of its key objectives, as outlined in the Terms of Reference (see Appendix A in DFO 2012 a).\nThe first objective was to provide integrated status evaluations that include identification of relevant metric(s) used for the status determination for each of the 24 Fraser River sockeye CUs. During the combination of break-out group and plenary sessions, final integrated statuses were completed for 22 out of the 24 Fraser Sockeye CUs, including synthesis of the key pieces of information used to designate status for each CU (Table 4 & Appendix 2). For two CUs (Chilko-ES and Seton-L), participants were unable to assess status and the details are provided in the status commentaries (Appendix 2). In additional detailed status integration results for each group were also recorded.\nThe workshop also delivered on its second objective: to develop clearly documented guidelines for combining information from different status metrics, using Fraser River sockeye CUs as test cases. The results for this objective, however, differed from the original expectations of the workshop organizers. Originally, the afternoon of the final day of the workshop was allotted to draft a set of generally applicable decision rules (i.e. an algorithm for status integration) within a full group plenary session. However, given the priority of the workshop was to complete integrated statuses for each of the 24 Fraser Sockeye CUs, and this objective took longer than planned during the workshop, half a day of the workshop was not specifically dedicated to developing decision rules as planned. Instead, details on status integration approaches were broadly recorded by each group throughout the workshop, both on individual group templates and in full group plenary sessions (recorded in the workshop transcript and organizers notes). This information was used to record consistencies amongst groups in their use of metrics and additional information to develop integrated CU statuses.\nBased on the in-depth discussions at the workshop, the case-by-case nuances in metrics used, and associated commentaries on the underlying data, it is not likely that a single prescriptive algorithm for status integration under the WSP can be developed. Rather, the CSAS workshop produced a process framework for status integration (previous section) and detailed guidelines for interpreting status-related information (See section on Status Integration Approaches starting on p. 13).\n3.1\nGROUP-SPECIFIC RESULTS\nFollowing break-out-group and plenary sessions, group results were recorded to capture the range of perspectives on each CU’s final integrated status (Table 3; Appendix 2). Despite differences in broad integration approaches between groups, there was consistency in the considerations of metrics and supplemental information used to designate status (see section on Status Integration Approaches on p.13). Specifically, 14 out of 24 CUs were assigned identical statuses, and one CU was designated data deficient by all groups (Table 3). The remaining nine CUs were designated different integrated statuses by individual groups, although all groups collectively agreed on a single (Red, Amber or Green) or blended (Red/Amber or Amber/Green) final integrated status for eight of these CUs (Table 4). Only one CU (Seton-L) could not be reconciled into a single or blended integrated status. Generally CUs that indicated a consistent status across metrics and supplemental information (for example, Cultus-L and Harrison River-River-Type; see Appendix 2) resulted in the most consistent integrated statuses amongst groups (Table 3). In contrast CUs that indicated contradictory statuses across metrics and additional information (for example, Seton-L and Francois-Fraser- S) (see Appendix 2) resulted in the most divergence amongst groups and individual group members.\n11\n\f3.2\nFINAL INTEGRATED STATUS\nIn the final plenary discussions, participants reached broad agreement on integrated statuses for 22 of the 24 CUs (Table 4). The 24 Fraser Sockeye CUs are ordered in Table 4 using their final integrated statuses, with CUs designated Red (poorest status) located at the top of the table to CUs designated Green (best status) at the bottom. Sixteen out of the 24 CUs were reconciled between groups in the final plenary session to a single WSP status. There were six CUs where final integrated statuses included two status zones. Both the Chilko-S and Lillooet- Harrison integrated Green statuses were flagged as provisional by participants, given these CUs have exhibited declining productivity and spawner abundance trends in recent years. The Taseko-ES Red integrated status was also flagged as provisional, given spawner escapement data for this CU are an index of abundance only and, therefore, this status designation was considered more uncertain. The integrated status of Chilko-ES was designated data deficient, as this CU does not have independent abundance data from the larger Chilko-S CU. Since the Chilko-ES CU contributes less than 10% to the total Chilko-ES/Chilko-S aggregate abundance, the aggregate status was assumed to represent the larger Chilko-S component. The integrated status of Seton-L was undetermined since final statuses amongst groups were widely divergent and remained unresolved through the final day’s plenary session.\nMost groups questioned the relative-abundance-metric benchmarks used for cyclic CUs (identified as cyclic in Table 4). Since this analytical issue could not be resolved at the workshop, participants agreed to exclude these metrics for cyclic CU status evaluations during the final day’s plenary session. The resulting integration approaches were similar to those developed for non-cyclic CUs with no recruitment data, and therefore, no relative-abundance metric benchmarks. Participants pointed out that this still left more information for status assessments than what is available for many other Pacific Salmon CUs.\n3.3\nSTATUS COMMENTARIES\nIn addition to providing final integrated statuses for each CU (which can comprise one to two status zones) (Table 4), expert interpretation of the summary data used to integrate status was recorded as status commentaries (Appendix 2). These commentaries provide the details underlying the final decisions on status designations, which varied even amongst CUs with identical integrated statuses. These details will be important when Strategy 1 (Standardized Monitoring of Wild Salmon Statuses) results are linked to Strategy 4 (Integrated Strategic Planning). Status zones alone do not provide an indication of which factors are driving their designation, which would influence subsequent WSP steps (e.g. Table 1).\nStatus commentaries are presented in Appendix 2 (with the CU name identified) in the same order workshop participants viewed the case studies during the workshop (from one to 24). This order should assist participants in reconciling their group’s and personal notes with those presented in Appendix 2. This CU order further provides the background on the sequence of case studies presented to participants at the workshop. The information presented in these commentaries are compiled from information recorded during the final day’s plenary sessions both electronically in files projected at the front of the room, and also from the meeting transcript. The data summaries and notes from individual group’s sheets were also used to expand on this information, where appropriate. Following the commentaries for each CU are the data summaries used by participants during the workshop to integrate CU status. These data summaries, therefore, provide the foundation for the commentaries provided in the current report.\n12\n\f3.4\nSTATUS INTEGRATION APPROACHES\nExpert opinion on status integration and associated commentaries were elicited from participants through a combination of smaller break-out group and full participant plenary sessions. Each group was able to develop a consistent approach to integrate status information across individual metrics and supplementary information for Fraser Sockeye CUs. The process was likened to checking a patient for symptoms, starting with key vital signs (i.e. various metrics), and then scanning for other signs of any underlying problems (i.e. supplemental information). Not all groups completed evaluations of all 24 CUs, but each CU was evaluated by several groups. While their broad approaches to integration differed, groups incorporated the following considerations in some form:\n\nRelative-abundance WSP metrics (which compares the 2007-2010 total spawner\n\nescapements to relative-abundance-metric benchmarks estimated across different model forms and different probability levels representing, respectively, structural uncertainty and stochastic, unexplained recruitment variation, uncertainty)\nFor non-cyclic CUs with recruitment data, one key piece of information relied upon by all groups was the WSP relative-abundance metric. This metric often was a driver of integrated status determinations, particularly if a CU’s relative-abundance-metric status was consistent across all benchmarks (i.e. across all models and probability levels presented) (Illustration A below). In these cases, absolute abundance was generally not given a high weight. In contrast, if a CU’s relative-abundance metric included multiple status zones (Illustration B below), then groups frequently used the status indicated by the median (50%) probability level benchmarks, rationalized the selection of one particular model form (based on the presence or absence of systematic productivity trends in the Ricker ‘a’ productivity parameter), and relied more heavily on other metrics and status-related information (including absolute abundance) to determine status. The use of benchmarks and statuses across probability levels, and not simply focusing on the median (50 percent probability level), represented a sensitivity analysis of status described by the relative-abundance metric, which describes uncertainty in the model fit to the data.\nA.

If a CU exhibited systematic productivity trends (indicated by the figures in the data summaries on time varying Ricker ‘a’ productivity parameter), then a model form that considers time- varying productivity was selected (truncated-Ricker, smoothed-Ricker and recursive- Bayesian Ricker model forms). If a CU exhibited no systematic productivity trends, then a standard full time series Ricker model form was selected.\nRelative-abundance-metric benchmarks were given a lower weight (or flagged in status commentaries for further evaluation) if productivity figures indicated high outliers (&gt; 20\n13\n\frecruits/spawner) in the recruits-per-spawner time series, which may contribute to biased low benchmarks and, therefore, optimistic statuses for this metric (note: although this was assumed at the workshop, the effect of productivity outliers on relative-abundance benchmarks remains untested, and further work is required to evaluate this assumption). In addition, relative-abundance-metric benchmarks were compared to COSEWIC Criteria D1 for small populations, and if close to benchmarks for these criteria (i.e. 250 & 1,000) this metric was also flagged as potentially producing optimistic status evaluations for a particular CU and given a lower weight in the integrated status.\n\nShort-Term Trends in Abundance WSP metric (which compares last three generation\n\ntrends in abundance to benchmarks)\nThis metric was generally considered in conjunction with other WSP metric results and status-related information. First, given many Fraser Sockeye CUs went through a period of high production (in many cases the highest abundances on their time series) in the 1990s, the recent trends in abundance reflect returns to average abundance for these CUs. Therefore, in these cases, the short-term trend metric generally was not weighted highly in status evaluations, given considerations of both the spawner abundance time series and recent years’ absolute abundances.\nParticipants also felt that while this short-term (escapement) trend metric reflects the current state of the CU (the response to all threats), these trends can be manipulated by human intervention (changes to fishing mortality) and, therefore, may mask intrinsic biological trends (such as survival rates). For this reason, participants typically relied on a CU’s intrinsic productivity trends (Ricker ‘a’ productivity parameter values whenever they were available, which removes density-dependence due to changing spawner abundances from CU productivity) to indicate status more than short-term escapement trends.\nHowever, even if both short-term trends and productivity trends indicated poor status, if both relative-abundance-metric statuses (across probability levels and model forms) and/or absolute abundance information indicated a consistently higher status, then the recent trend information was given a lower weight in status designations. In these cases, however, participants frequently flagged recent trends in abundance and productivity as something important to monitor closely, given the integrated status could deteriorate in the near future if these trends persist. Conversely, if short-term trends and productivity trends indicated a poor status and relative- or absolute-abundance metrics in recent years were low, then all indicators together supported a lower status designation.\n\nLong-Term Trends in Abundance WSP metric (which compares last generation spawner\n\nabundances to the long-term time series)\nIf relative-abundance WSP metric status information was available for a CU, the long- term trend WSP metric was generally given almost no weight in status evaluations. Statuses indicated by the long-term-trend metric were considered optimistic, given the early time series is confounded by higher exploitation rates for Fraser Sockeye CUs, which is a consideration when interpreting the status indicated by these metrics (see Porszt et al. 2012). Similarly, the long-term metric is not informative for some CUs, such as channel-operated systems (increased production after channels were initiated in the 1960’s/1970’s) and de novo CUs (new hatchery-origin CUs returning from an earlier extirpated state), where the historical escapement time series does not reflect the natural state of the system.\nIf relative-abundance-metric status information was not available for a CU, the long-term metric was given some weight in status evaluations. In these cases, however, absolute\n14\n\fabundance information was given a higher relative weight and linked to the WSP long- term trend metric status. Given that statuses produced by the long-term trend WSP metric were considered optimistic, this metric was more likely to influence status evaluations if it indicated a lower status (Amber or Red), versus a good status (Green), and was again linked to absolute abundance information.\n\nAbsolute abundance metric (absent from Holt et al. 2009 as a recommended metric,\n\ntherefore COSEWIC Criteria D1 for small populations of &lt;1,000 were used to identify CU risk to extirpation on this metric)\nGroups frequently relied on absolute abundance to evaluate a CU’s integrated status, particularly when relative-abundance metrics were not available or, when available, if statuses were inconsistent across probability levels and model forms. If one to four of a non-cyclic CU’s recent years (2007 – 2010) total spawner escapements fell below the COSEWIC Criteria D1, this would typically drive a lower integrated status designation (Illustration C below). In contrast, if none of the four recent years fell below the COSEWIC Criteria D1, then this would typically drive a higher integrated status designation (Illustration D below). Either of these drivers of status designations would be strengthened by whether or not any years on the entire time series fell below the COSEWIC Criteria D1 designation.\nC. Example CU where absolute abundance D. Example CU where no absolute throughout the time series falls below abundances on the time series fall below COSEWIC Criteria D1 (incl. last 4 yrs) COSEIWC Criteria D1 (see Appendix 1 for details) (see Appendix 1 for details)\nSummary of Observations and Estimates\nSummary of Observations and Estimates\nEffective Total Spawners\nAll Yrs\n2,109 560 22\nMax Med Min\nLast 12 1,522 161 22\nLast 4 1,522 571 63\nNumber of Observations in a range\n5000\n2500 1000 500 250 0\n0 0 12 20 12 17\n0 0 1 2 0 9\n0 0 1 1 0 2\nEffective Total Spawners\nAll Yrs\nMax 2,125,393 Med 276,194 Min 15,141\nLast 12 2,125,393 496,146 90,273\nLast 4 2,125,393 255,898 131,678\nNumber of Observations in a range\n5000\n2500 1000 500 250 0\n61 0 0 0 0 0\n12 0 0 0 0 0\n4 0 0 0 0 0\nSmall Population Benchmarks (COSEWIC Criterion D1)\nSmall Population Benchmarks (COSEWIC Criterion D1)\nFor cyclic CUs, weak (low abundance) versus dominant (high abundance) cycles influenced how absolute abundance information was interpreted. If a weak cycle year specifically fell below COSEWIC Criteria D1 in recent years, this alone did not drive a lower status designation if the dominant cycle year abundance was relatively high.\nIn cases where the recent trends in abundance metric indicated a Red status and recent productivity trends were decreasing, high absolute abundances in recent years were also used to justify a better integrated status.\nAbsolute abundance was also linked to the WSP long-term trend metric, particularly in cases where the long-term trend metric was Green in status and absolute abundance was high, both combined supported a higher WSP integrated status zone (i.e. Amber or Green) even if recent trends and productivity indicated a lower status.\n15\n\fSimilarly, if absolute abundance was low (for some recent years falling below COSEWIC Criteria D1), then even positive short-term trend statuses (Green or Amber) and recent increases in abundances did not over-ride the poor status designated by absolute abundance.\nCOSEWIC Criteria D1 was also used to evaluate relative-abundance-metric benchmarks. If benchmarks were small, relative to these criteria, then the status indicated by relative-abundance metrics was given a lower weight in status considerations.\n\nProductivity Trends (presented in data summaries)\n\nIn cases where relative-abundance-metric statuses were inconsistent across model forms and probability levels, systematically decreasing productivity trends (indicated by the Ricker ‘a’ parameter value), were used to justify the selection of a time-varying productivity model (truncated-Ricker, smoothed Ricker, and recursive-Bayesian Ricker forms) to indicate status for this metric. In cases where relative-abundance metric statuses were consistent across model forms and probability levels, this model selection step was not conducted by participants.\nProductivity information also was used to evaluate whether or not there were a number of high outliers in the stock-recruitment time series (recruits/spawner &gt; 20), which was used by participants to flag relative-abundance-metric benchmarks and statuses and/or assign a lower weight to these metrics in status evaluations. Relative-abundance-metric benchmarks were given a lower weight (or flagged in status commentaries for further evaluation) if productivity figures indicated high outliers (&gt; 20 recruits/spawner) in the recruits-per-spawner time series, which may contribute to biased low benchmarks and, therefore, optimistic statuses for this metric (note: although the assumption that high productivity years represent biased stock-recruitment data, and therefore, may affect benchmarks remains untested, and further work is required to evaluate this assumption).\nProductivity trends were also used in conjunction with recent productivity information (productivity below replacement in recent years) and the WSP short-term trend metric. In particular, this information may not change a high status designation for CUs with consistently high relative-abundance metric and absolute abundance information, however this information would flag a CU for further monitoring (such as Chilko-S and Lillooet-Harrison-L). In contrast, for CUs without consistent statuses across relative- abundance metrics or for CUs with not relative-abundance metrics, this information combined would drive status designations.\n\nFishing Mortality and Return Trends (presented in data summaries)\n\nFishing mortality and return trend figures, not included in the original data summaries for each CU case study, were requested by participants on the first day of the workshop. Participants felt that the estimation of the short-term and long-term trend metrics that relied on spawner escapement data is confounded by fishing mortality in particular.\nFor the short-term trend metric, if both abundance (i.e. spawner escapement) and fishing mortality was decreasing in recent years, this combination of trends was flagged for particular CUs in their status commentaries. Specifically, if abundance is decreasing, despite decreases in fisheries exploitation, then this would indicate the underlying mechanism of these declines is likely linked to intrinsic productivity decreases. For this reason, often productivity trends were considered more relevant in status evaluations, since this information focuses on an intrinsic characteristic of the population.\n16\n\fFor the long-term trend metric, if fishing mortality was high early in the time series, relative to the current period (as is the case for most Fraser Sockeye CUs), then the influence of early high exploitation on the historical spawner escapement time series would result in optimistic long-term trend metrics when compared to current year’s escapements. For this reason, the long-term trend metric was frequently discounted in status evaluations.\nAll groups struggled with interpreting the status information for cyclic CUs. The following specific considerations for cyclic CUs emerged as a practical compromise, pending further analyses:\n The Larkin model was considered more appropriate than the Ricker model for describing the spawner-recruit relationships of highly cyclic CUs. This was supported by analysts’ commentary on statistical measures of model fit. (Note: statistical model comparisons were not available to participants). However, the key issue was whether or not the relative-abundance-metric benchmarks using the Larkin model were estimated correctly, which could not be resolved during the workshop. Therefore, relative-abundance metrics were excluded from final status considerations for cyclic CUs. The resulting status integration approaches were similar to those developed for non-cyclic CUs, where relative-abundance-metric benchmark estimates were not available.\n Unique considerations for cyclic CUs, given the exclusion of relative-abundance\nbenchmarks, included considerations of trends in abundance and absolute abundances across all four cycle lines together and also separately. For non-cyclic CUs, any single year in the last four years falling below COSEWIC Criteria D1 often resulted in a lower status designation, depending on indicators from other metrics and status-related information. However, for cyclic CUs, if a single year falls below COSEWIC Criteria D1, if this year is a weak cycle year and conversely, the dominant cycle year is quite large, then this information was flagged but not weighted as much in status designations. Similarly, if a declining trend is driven by a weak cycle, although flagged as a concern, this trend was not weighted as much in status evaluations for cyclic CUs.\n4\nDISCUSSION\n4.1\nINTEGRATED STATUS OF FRASER SOCKEYE CUS\nIntegrated status designations and associated commentaries were developed for the 24 Fraser Sockeye CUs, to address one of the two workshop objectives outlined in the Terms of Reference: “provide integrated status evaluations that include identification of relevant metric(s) used for the status determination for each of the 24 Fraser River Sockeye CUs”. Integrated status designations for Fraser Sockeye CUs cover all three WSP status zones, ranging from Red (poor) to Green (healthy) (Table 4). Although single integrated statuses were not developed for all CUs, blended statuses (i.e. Red/Amber or Amber/Green) were still useful for relative CU ranking. There were two CUs where status could not be determined, either because the CU was data deficient, or because the CU had contradictory status information that could not be resolved by workshop participants. Detailed status commentaries were also produced for each of the 24 Fraser Sockeye CUs and are documented in Appendix 2. The combination of integrated status designations and status commentaries is recommended for inputs into the subsequent Strategy 4 on strategic planning (Table 1).\nIntegrated statuses for the seven CUs designated Red and four CUs designated Red/Amber, represent the highest conservation concern of the 24 Fraser Sockeye CUs, and the highest priority for future assessments. These CUs tend to be naturally small in terms of abundance\n17\n\f(Cultus-L, Bowron-ES, Taseko-ES, Widgeon-River-Type, Nahatlach-ES, and Chilliwack-ES), occupying a smaller geographic distribution, and/or were located higher up in the watershed (Takla-Trembleur-EStu, Bowron-ES, Quesnel-S, Nadina-Francois-ES, Francois-Fraser-S, Takla-Trembleur-Stuart-S), where adults returning to their natal systems to spawn have farther to migrate (Figure 3). In order of decreasing conservation concern and assessment priority are the four Amber, two Amber/Green, and five Green CUs (Table 4). In contrast to the Red and Red/Amber designated CUs, these CUs tend to spawn lower in the watershed, both immediately upstream of Hells Gate (Shuswap, Chilko, Anderson-Seton systems) and downstream of Hells Gate (Harrison & Lillooet, and Pitt systems). The CUs in these systems also tend to have generally larger abundances and/or broader spatial distribution compared to CUs in the Red and Red/Amber designations (Figure 3).\nStatus designations for cyclic CUs were considered more uncertain than those for non-cyclic CUs. This is attributed to the exclusion of relative-abundance metrics from evaluations due to participants’ concern over the estimation of these benchmarks using the Larkin model, and the appropriate methods to summarize recent abundance data to compare to benchmarks. Since this analytical issue could not be resolved at the workshop, participants agreed to exclude these metrics for cyclic CU status evaluations during the final day’s plenary session. The resulting integration approaches were similar to those developed for non-cyclic CUs with no recruitment data, and therefore, no relative-abundance metric benchmarks. Participants pointed out that this still left more information for status assessments than what is available for many other Pacific Salmon CUs.\nAppropriate estimation of relative-abundance-metric benchmarks using time-varying model forms was also debated by workshop participants. Further, a recent evaluation of Fraser Sockeye productivity trends using an alternative model form (Larkin model), in addition to the standard Ricker model, reports different productivity trends for particular CUs (Peterman & Dorner 2012) from those presented at the workshop (based on Grant et al. 2011 results). For one CU in particular (i.e. Quesnel-S, see Appendix 2 of Grant & Pestal 2012), Larkin model- derived productivity trends could influence the final integrated status and commentary.\n4.2\nSTATUS INTEGRATION PROCESS\nExpert opinion on status integration and associated commentaries were solicited through a combination of smaller break-out group and full participant plenary sessions. The advantage of this approach was that it permitted independent small group evaluation of a range of integration approaches and integrated statuses, which could then be consolidated in a series of plenary sessions with all participants. Additionally, it provided the advantage of evaluating the robustness of status determinations through comparisons of independent group results (6 in total). Although the size of the integration process, with 34 participants in a three day workshop, may not be feasible for covering all 450+ Pacific salmon CUs under the WSP, the general approach of independent versus full group work could be replicated with a smaller number of participants over a shorter period of time. Several key steps are recommended for subsequent status integration processes:\n\n\n\nto ground the status integration process, the definitions of WSP status zones (Table 2; Figure 1), and the assessment actions and management drivers for CUs designated in the different status zones (Table 1), need to be clearly articulated prior to the start of these processes;\n\nproduction of standardized data summaries for each CU using previously reviewed\n\nmetric-specific status evaluations and associated data;\n\n\n\n‘blind’ status evaluations throughout most of the integration process to ensure a\n18\n\fstandardized approach to status evaluations across all Pacific Salmon CUs, which focuses status integration on the consistently presented data summaries;\n\npre-workshop interviews of participants to bring them up to speed on the material and to also present possible barriers to integration success, which could then be resolved prior to meeting;\n\n\n\nrevealing of CU names at the end of the process to add any relevant information to the status determinations by the CU-specific experts;\nindependent evaluation of status by three or more individual (or three or more groups of) stock assessment technical experts, representing varied backgrounds (including individuals with biological expertise on different salmon species and CUs, and varied specializations in conservation and stock assessment science); selection of technical experts from both DFO and external groups such as academia, First Nations, environmental non-governmental organizations (NGOs), is recommended to provide a broad diversity of technical perspectives for the integration process.\n\nas a final step, plenary synthesis of independent statuses and status commentaries;\n\nData summaries represented a critical step in status integration, by providing a tool for standardization and efficiency in the integration process. Detailed information on CU biology or CU-specific habitat and/or ecosystem threats were excluded from these data summaries (and, therefore, from Fraser Sockeye CU status integration). Instead, this level of detail is required in the subsequent WSP strategy on strategic planning (Strategy 4), where habitat (Strategy 2) and ecosystem (Strategy 3) information is linked to Strategy 1’s status integration results and further analytical assessments (Table 1). One important component to Fraser Sockeye status assessments was the inclusion of uncertainty particularly in abundance metrics, which were presented in the foundational publication (Grant et al. 2011) and also in the data summaries. These included comparing both stochastic uncertainty (unexplained variability in recruitment) and structural uncertainty (use of different model forms to describe population dynamics, including forms that consider time varying productivity).\nAlthough most participants agreed that ‘blind’ unnamed CUs was an appropriate approach for the status integration process, there remained some concerns that important information was being excluded using this approach. Organizers had debated the use of ‘blind’ versus named CUs prior to the workshop, and concluded that ‘blind’ status integration was most appropriate for a number of reasons. First, not naming CUs avoided inefficient side-tracks that might focus discussions on very specific and detailed local habitat or biological information, and specific threats to the CU, not relevant to WSP status integration process. In addition, the contribution of this additional information would vary amongst CUs, and therefore, would result in statuses that were not comparable between CUs; standardization of WSP assessments was an important consideration for choosing to use unnamed CUs in the integration process. Finally, not naming CUs was considered important to avoid any potential biases to status designations (linked to gut feelings or fisheries implications), and instead, to focus participants on the current status-related information used for WSP integration.\nTo alleviate some concerns regarding mostly ‘blind’ assessments, CU names were revealed as a last step in the integration process, to provide participants with the opportunity to introduce any specific supplementary information relevant to a CUs WSP status, which could be used to rationalize a change to the integrated status or that could be added to the CU status commentaries. Given this was the first WSP status integration process, less time was spent on this step at the expense of ensuring participants focused on completing thorough status assessments using the standardized data summaries for each CU. In the future, given\n19\n\fefficiencies gained through experience in the current process, it is recommended that more time be allotted to this final step at the end of the integration process.\n4.3\nINTEGRATION GUIDELINES\nThe second goal for the workshop was “to develop clearly documented guidelines for combining information from different status metrics”. Details on status integration approaches were broadly recorded for each group, and status commentaries developed in the plenary discussion capture the key pieces of status information used by groups to designate statuses for each CU. Based on the in-depth discussions at the workshop and the case-by-case nuances in metrics used and associated commentaries on the underlying data, it is not likely that a single prescriptive algorithm for status integration under the WSP can be developed. Rather, the CSAS workshop produced a framework for future status integration processes (see previous section) and detailed guidelines for interpreting status-related information (See section on Status Integration Approaches).\nWhile broad approaches to WSP status integration differed between groups, each group incorporated a number of considerations consistently. First, for CUs with recruitment data, one key piece of information relied upon by all groups was the WSP relative-abundance metric. This metric generally was given a higher weight in status determinations if a CU’s abundance metric status was consistent across all benchmarks (i.e. across all models and probability levels presented). In contrast, if a CUs relative-abundance metric included multiple status zones, then groups frequently used the status indicated by the median (50%) probability level benchmarks, rationalized the selection of one particular model form, and relied more heavily on other metrics to determine status. Other metrics included in the previously developed WSP toolkit used to assess Fraser Sockeye status, including recent and long-term trends in abundance, did not influence status determinations consistently, and their interpretation by groups relied heavily on trends in CU productivity (recruits/spawner), abundance (spawners and returns), and fishing mortality. Of note, metrics not included in the previously developed WSP toolkit, such as absolute abundance (compared to COSEWIC criteria) and productivity trends, were important considerations for final status determinations.\nDuring the workshop, participants provided feedback on WSP status integration methods. Most important was the recognition that no single metric alone, in the absence of the consideration of additional metrics and supplemental biological information, drove the integrated status designation. A recent evaluation of the reliability of specifically 20 different trends in abundance metrics to indicate a population’s extirpation risk was conducted, which reported a continuum of indicator performance (Porszt et al. 2012). In this study, although long-term trends in abundance indicators generally performed better as a group than short-term trends in abundance indicators, this difference was small (&lt;10% difference) (Porszt et al. 2012). Given the relative similarities in performance, it is important to evaluate and interpret the status results from multiple metrics, in conjunction with supplemental data and information on a population.\nAt the workshop, careful interpretation of statuses indicated by short-term and long-term trend in abundance metrics was recommended by participants. Since escapement data is used to evaluate these metrics (mature individuals that will contribute to the next generation are specifically used in these types of evaluations, which does not include individuals removed by fisheries or en-route migration mortalities), exploitation and habitat alteration are factors that can influence these escapement trends. For short-term trends, which is a metric used by COSEWIC and IUCN to drive their status assessments, participants felt that while these trends reflect the current state of the CU (the response to all threats), they do not necessarily indicate intrinsic biological CU trends (such as survival rates). As a result, short-term trends can lag intrinsic productivity trends, since reductions to fishing mortality can offset escapement trends in\n20\n\fthe short-term. Therefore, participants typically relied on a CU’s intrinsic productivity (Ricker ‘a’ productivity parameter values, which remove density-dependence due to changing spawner abundances) trends to indicate status more than short-term trends.\nFurther to interpret short-term trend metrics, the retrospective statuses presented for WSP metrics on the second page of the CU data summaries illustrate how this metric’s status changes over the course of a time series. For example, Cultus-L and Widgeon-River Type experienced a few periods in their later time series where the short-term trends in abundance metric indicated a Green status, when other indicators and information indicate otherwise. Conversely, there were a number of CUs (such as Chilko-S and others), where the short-term trend metric indicated a Red status, when all other metrics indicated an Amber or Green status, as these CUs were returning to average (relatively high) abundance following periods of exceptional production in the 1990’s. In these latter cases, trends were flagged as something important to monitor, but when integrated with other metrics and escapement trend information, these poor short-term trend statuses did not drive the integrated status designations.\nThe long-term trends in abundance metric may also not be as relevant for CU status evaluations in cases where exploitation was high early in the time series, or human-induced habitat changes altered spawning habitat between early and late periods of the time series (such as systems where artificial spawning channels were constructed in the 1960’s/70’s). Since most Fraser Sockeye CUs experienced high exploitation earlier in the time series, and therefore, lower escapements than would have naturally occurred in the absence of fishing mortality, the long- term trend metric was flagged as producing optimistic statuses (since it compares the current generation escapements to this historical time series). As a result, this metric was typically not given a high weight in status evaluations, unless it indicated a poorer status (Amber or Red).\nWorkshop participants debated whether status evaluation should reflect only the current status, or anticipate future status based on current trends. For example, Chilko-S and Lillooet-Harrison- L, were two CUs where almost all metrics indicated a Green status, yet recent trends in abundance indicated a Red status. In these cases, the trend metric was not considered an immediate concern given high absolute and relative abundances for these CUs, and also because these CUs were returning to average following a period of exceptional production. Therefore, although short-term trends did not influence the final integrated Green status for these CUs, participants flagged these CUs as provisional due to these short-term trends. Since Green statuses for CUs do not require detailed analytical assessments and management response, participants felt it important to flag these CUs as provisional so that these decreasing trends are not ignored in the near future. These considerations are also linked to how often WSP statuses are evaluated. If statuses are assessed every year versus every ten years, this can affect how integrated statuses are designated, particularly in regards to which metrics indicate the current state of the CU (abundance metrics and long-term trends) versus where the CU is headed if current trends persist (productivity and short-term abundance trends).\n5\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis workshop on WSP status integration, which used Fraser Sockeye CUs as case studies, represents the first integration process for Pacific Salmon. This integration step builds on the considerable amount of work published in the years leading up to the workshop related to WSP Strategy 1 (Holtby & Ciruna 2007; Holt et al. 2009; Holt 2009; Porszt 2009; Holt 2010; Grant et al. 2011; Holt & Bradford 2011; Porszt et al. 2012). Status integration is expected to evolve, given lessons learned through the current workshop, and subsequent processes. In the current integration workshop, most of the Fraser Sockeye case studies represent data rich CUs (long time series of stock-recruitment data) in the Pacific Region, which are largely unrepresentative\n21\n\fof the mostly data poor Pacific Region CUs. Although there are some examples of data poor Fraser Sockeye CUs, more examples from other species and areas are required to expand the examples currently presented. For future groups of CUs, which represent different data availabilities and metrics evaluated, future similar CSAS-supported workshops are recommended to build upon the integration methods developed in the current workshop. Further recommendations are provided below to assist with the implementation of future integration processes. After a range of CUs has been evaluated in similar processes, it may be possible to proceed with smaller expert-driven teams for status integration processes.\n6\nRECOMMENDATIONS\nThe WSP Status Integration workshop, presented in the current paper, was the first process conducted to address WSP biological status integration. As a result, there were a number of lessons learned and recommendations identified by participants that could be applied to future WSP biological status integration processes generally, and also to future Fraser Sockeye CU status integration processes specifically.\nGenerally applicable to all Pacific salmon WSP status integration processes are the following recommendations:\n\nFurther clarification on the frequency of WSP status assessments is required to ground the status integration process; for example status assessments conducted every year, versus every ten years, could influence status designations;\nIt is recommended that data summaries, which were developed for the current workshop by a technical team over a period of several months, should be consistent amongst Pacific Salmon CUs and evolve as additional CUs are assessed;\nShort summaries for each CU should be added to each data summary, which includes\n\nthe history of the CU (such as systems with artificial channels), and other information required specifically for interpretation of data summary information;\n\nthe addition of an absolute abundance metric in the Holt et al. (2009) WSP toolkit of metrics, and the development of associated benchmarks; in the absence of WSP absolute-abundance benchmarks, the current integration process defaulted to using COSEWIC Criteria D1 for small populations for this metric’s benchmarks;\nthe addition of a productivity metric to the Holt et al. (2009) WSP status evaluation\n\ntoolkit; participants used the productivity trends in status evaluations broadly, given the absence of WSP-defined lower and upper benchmarks;\n\nIncreased clarity was requested regarding the difference between the Ricker ‘a’\n\nparameter value CU productivity time series and the recruits per effective female spawner time series, where the former removes density-dependent effects on productivity and, therefore, should reflect differences in marine and freshwater survival, rather than simply changes in spawner abundances;\n\ninclusion of fishing mortality and return trends in the data summaries was recommended\n\nto assist with the interpretation of the long-term trends and short-term trend in abundance WSP metrics;\n\nanalytical evaluation of relative-abundance metrics based on carrying capacity data (presented in Holt et al. 2009) is required to determine extirpation risk and recovery potential, similar to evaluations conducted for relative-abundance metrics based on stock-recruitment data (i.e. Holt 2009; Holt 2010; Holt & Bradford 2011);\n\n22\n\f9) provision of model diagnostics for each model used to estimate relative-abundance-\nmetric benchmarks; this would assist participants in evaluating the model forms most appropriate for each CU;\n\nalthough the individual WSP benchmarks that specifically correspond to particular COSEWIC criteria include a buffer to the extirpation risk identified by COSEWIC, clarification is required regarding how WSP benchmarks should provide an overall buffer to ‘being considered at risk of extinction by COSEWIC’, where COSEWIC’s process to determine overall extirpation risk relies on expert interpretation and integration across all individual criteria;\nfurther CSAS-supported workshops are recommended for Pacific Salmon CU status\n\nintegration processes, where the suite of metrics and supplementary information used to designate status differs significantly from those explored for Fraser Sockeye CUs; this would ensure consistency in process between species and different individuals conducting assessments;\nSpecific to future Fraser Sockeye CU WSP status integration processes are the following recommendations:\n\ndecisions regarding whether or not relative-abundance-metric benchmarks are required for cyclic CUs must occur; currently, cyclic CUs represent a small fraction of all 450+ Pacific Salmon CUs, so trade-offs between investing further work in relative-abundance metrics for these CUs (currently, despite months of work by an analytical internal/external group, has not resolved analytical questions related to cyclic CUs), versus using all remaining metric and supplementary information to assess status for these CUs must be considered\nif it is decided that relative-abundance metrics are required for cyclic CUs, then there are\n\na number of fundamental questions that present on-going challenges for these CUs: for example, are we calculating these benchmarks correctly? Do Larkin-derived benchmarks for cyclic CUs represent equivalent extirpation risk and recovery potential to Ricker-derived benchmarks for non-cyclic CUs? Does the approach for evaluating current abundance state (geometric mean) represent equivalent extirpation risk/recovery potential for cyclic CUs?\n\nadditional work is required to estimate productivity trends for applicable CUs using the Larkin model (rather than the Ricker model used at the workshop), which removes density-dependent cycle-line interactions from the productivity trends; the workshop proceeded using CSAS reviewed results presented in Grant et al. (2011), however, very recent work by Peterman & Dorner (2011 & 2012) and Michielsens (Pacific Salmon Commission, 2012, pers. comm.), indicate different productivity trends may occur if Larkin model forms are used for particular CUs (Quesnel is one example where Larkin- derived productivity trends do not show the same recent decreases as the Ricker- derived productivity trends, which likely would influence the final status designation for this CU); the model form used to evaluate productivity trends will be important to explore further in light of this recent research, given the high weight assigned to productivity trends in the status integration process;\nat the workshop it was assumed that anomalously high productivity years (&gt; 20 R/S) may indicate biased recruitment data, and therefore, potentially biased relative- abundance benchmarks; this assumption has not been tested, and therefore, further evaluation of this is recommended;\nfuture work on pulling out Chilko-ES specific escapement data is recommended, so that\n\n23\n\fstatus can be assessed for this currently data deficient CU in the future.\n7\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nFirst and foremost, we acknowledge Marilyn Joyce, the workshop Chair, who rapidly oriented herself to the complex issues of WSP Strategy 1 and Fraser Sockeye CUs from both the process and technical perspective. Marilyn also brought notable enthusiasm and skill to the long and demanding workshop process which, included with her unprecedented attention to organizational details, was instrumental to the success of this first WSP status integration process.\nIn addition, we gratefully acknowledge the considerable support provided to workshop planning from individuals on the internal DFO organizing team (alphabetical order by last name): Mike Bradford, Al Cass, Steve Cox-Rogers, Jeff Grout, Ann-Marie Huang, Jim Irvine, Les Jantz, Marilyn Joyce, Marc Labelle, Wilf Luedke, Paul Ryall, Timber Whitehouse, Mark Saunders, Neil Schubert, Arlene Tompkins, and Chris Wood. Each individual brought unique perspectives and insight to the organizing committee, which greatly assisted with fleshing out the workshop process and technical details. The success of the workshop is attributed to the time this group of individuals dedicated to many workshop-related discussions and debates. Al Cass, in particular, played both a key role in the organizing committee and was a key member of the facilitation team at the workshop. In addition, we thank Carrie Holt who provided considerable support on the early internal DFO workshop, and her foundational work on WSP metrics which paved the way for the current workshop. We also thank the rapporteur, Bronwyn MacDonald for her superb rapporteur abilities, as she skillfully recorded the discussions over the three day workshop. We thank Mike Lapointe, Greg Taylor, and Jim Irvine who provided helpful comments, which identified particular elements of the paper for clarification. Last, but certainly not least, we thank the workshop’s participants who played a key role in both the synthesis of status information for Fraser Sockeye CUs, and the development of status integration methods for Pacific Salmon. Without their participation and dedication to the workshop process, no workshop, would there be.\n8\nLITERATURE CITED\nCass A.J. and C.C. Wood. 1994.

WSP status is Red if the last generation abundance is below the lower benchmark, Green if it is above the upper benchmark , and Amber if it is between the lower and upper benchmarks.\nKey Challenge: How to integrate uncertainty in benchmarks (and resulting status assessments) for each CU that includes 1) across alternative population dynamic models (rows in benchmark tables); and 2) across probability levels that reflect uncertainty in the model fit to the data (columns in benchmark tables).\nABUNDANCE (Effective Total Spawners)\nLONG-TERM TREND (Eff.

Female Spawners)\nRatio (geometric means)\n3 Gen Change (in 4yr Avg)\n1.15\n-57%\nRatio of current average over historical average\nCurrent gen. avg.\n46,414\nHistorical avg.\n40,202\nProb. of 25% Decl. over 3 Gen\n98%\nSection 3: Data Quality Overall quality of data used in status evaluations.\nSlope over the last 12 yrs in 4yr running average of log(EFS), converted back into an absolute change. A 57% decrease means that the 4yr average now is less than half what it was 3 generations ago.\nSupporting information: shows the probability that the recent (last 3 generations) trends slope has declined 25% or more, given uncertainty in the slope estimate due to variability in the observations.\nData Quality\nExcellent\nVery Good\nGood\nFair\nPoor\nan estimate with poor accuracy due to poor counting conditions, few surveys (one or two in a given year), incomplete time series, etc.;\nAn unbreached fence estimate with extremely high accuracy given an almost complete census of counts.\nan estimate of high reliability using mark recapture methods, DIDSON methods, or near-complete fence counts that have relatively high accuracy and precision. Visual surveys that have been calibrated with local fence programs;\nFour or more visual inspections with good visibility;\nAn estimate using two or more visual inspections that occur during peak spawning where fish visibility is reasonable; methodology and data quality varies across the time series in terms of good to poor quality;\n35\n\fSection 4: Productivity patterns\nKey Point: Observed productivity (recruits / spawner) can show pronounced trends over time.\nKey Challenge: Should this information be considered in the evaluation of status, and if so, how?\nThe points show standardized deviations from the long-term average ln(R/EFS), which is independent of population models. Years with positive deviations had higher than average productivity. The red line shows an estimated pattern in the productivity parameter for a Ricker model.\nPoints show the raw estimates of productivity over time, and the red line shows a running 4yr average. Note the log scale, such that each horizontal line marks a 10-fold increase. If R/ETS is less than 1, the population failed to replace itself in that generation. R/ETS larger than about 20 are probably due to biased estimates.\nPRODUCTIVITY TIME SERIES\nStandard Residuals\nln(R/EFS) resid\nSmoothed a pars\nR/ETS\nData Issues ?\nRepl.

Some participants leaned towards a Red designation for this CU, given this CUs absolute abundances were close to this criterion’s benchmarks;\n45\n\fABUNDANCE (Effective Total Spawners)\nLONG-TERM TREND (Eff.

Most participants agreed that this CU is currently in the green status zone, but short-term trend raises a flag to track it closely. Some participants argued for an amber designation to emphasize the worrisome trend.\n56\n\fABUNDANCE (Effective Total Spawners)\nLONG-TERM TREND (Eff. Female Spawners)\nSHORT-TERM TREND (Eff.

Ensuring Treaty obligations are met and implementation is followed correctly entails gathering data and information for assessment purposes. This is done in support of Fraser River Panel management actions aimed at meeting objectives pertaining to (1) achieving spawning escapement targets, (2) meeting international catch allocation goals and (3) meeting domestic catch allocation objectives. As a result, data and information are collected throughout the year and analyzed from the perspective of pre-season planning, in-season management and post-season review. This technical report serves to document the pre-season and in-season assessment methods supporting Fraser River Panel management of Fraser River sockeye salmon.\nThis technical report is a compilation of short chapters that document different data collection and assessment methods for Fraser River sockeye salmon, with special reference to 2018 given the data collection and assessment methods are most comprehensive on this cycle line. Each chapter can potentially be used as a separate, stand-alone document or sub-report when wanting to provide others with information on the topic and are also accessible in this format to Fraser River Panel and Technical Committee members on the PSC SharePoint site or to others upon request. Each chapter/sub-report contains all the technical details required to understand, critique and replicate the methods. This includes among others an overview of the data and the methods used and planned changes or areas for improvement. To ensure the accessibility of the individual chapters and prevent readers from being overwhelmed by details, the individual chapters are restricted to about five pages. If the information on a topic is too lengthy, it is spread over several chapters, either by providing first a more general overview followed by one or more chapters that go into further detail (e.g., a chapter discussing the overall hydroacoustic program at Mission followed by several chapters of the different components of the hydroacoustic program), or by spreading one topic over several chapters (e.g., separate discussion of marine versus in-river catchability estimates). The use of individual chapters as sub-reports allows more flexibility in terms of adding additional documentation for new methods or revising documentation of existing methods instead of republishing an entirely updated technical report. It is anticipated that future published versions of this technical report will also incorporate post-season assessment methods as well as methods to assess Fraser River pink salmon.\nThis technical report aims to inform members of the Fraser River Panel and technical committee, academia and the general public about the different data collection and assessment methods for Fraser River sockeye salmon. This report does not aim to provide the results of these assessments, which can be found in the Fraser River Panel annual reports available on the PSC website (www.psc.org). Further questions regarding this technical report and its content can be directed to info@psc.org.\n4\n\fAssessment Overview of Fraser River Sockeye\nAnnual pre-season planning of the fisheries management season for Fraser River sockeye starts by gathering the necessary inputs for the PSC Planning Model (Chapter A6), a simulation tool used by the Fraser River Panel to assess the ability of different fisheries plans to reach management targets given the information and forecasts available preseason (Chapter A7). Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) provides some of this information: run size forecasts for the different management groups (Chapter A1), marine timing and northern diversion rate forecasts (Chapter A2), and the spawning escapement plan (Chapter A4), while PSC Secretariat staff provide forecasts of test fishing catches (Chapter A5) and forecasted estimates of en route losses, i.e., differences between predicted and observed escapement estimates (DBEs, differences between estimates). The latter inform the Management Adjustment (MA, Chapter A3) which refers to the additional fish added to an escapement target to increase the likelihood of achieving that target. The Planning Model relies on a forward reconstruction with assumptions on fish movement and migration behaviour (Chapter A8) as well as assumptions about the vulnerability of sockeye to different fisheries operations (Chapter A9). The Planning Model helps create pre-season fisheries schedules and assesses the sensitivity of fishery plans and the achievement of management targets to alternative biological and management scenarios. This helps guide pre-season planning for stakeholders and informs early in-season management prior to the availability of updated in-season information.\nIn-season fisheries management relies on real time data of returning sockeye to adjust and refine preseason fisheries plans and helps guide fisheries management decisions. One of the key data sources in-season are the test fisheries (Chapter B1) that provide information on abundance, timing, and diversion rates as well as species and stock composition information for use in stock assessments. Test fishing occurs in marine approaches to the Fraser River (Johnstone Strait and Juan de Fuca Strait) and within the Fraser River. While purse seine and gillnets form the main gear types used for quantitative assessments, the PSC test fisheries also include troll/hook and line test fisheries to assess delaying sockeye in the Strait of Georgia, and reef net test fisheries. One key data set collected by these test fisheries is the catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) data (Chapter B2), which is used to estimate daily sockeye abundances in the test fishing area. For marine test fisheries in Johnstone Strait and Juan de Fuca Strait, the CPUE data along with an expansion line estimate (the inverse of the catchability coefficient) are used to derive daily abundances (Chapter B4). At the start of the season, historical expansion line estimates are applied, derived from data from past years. Because abundances predicted this way may deviate substantially from the true abundance to the high variability in expansion lines, both between years and within a season, expansion lines are updated once sufficient in-season observations have been obtained. The abundance estimates based on marine CPUE data are considered early indicators of the expected in river abundance given that it takes sockeye approximately 6 to 8 days to migrate from marine areas to the Fraser River. In the Fraser River, daily sockeye abundance estimates are primarily based on hydroacoustic data collected at Mission (Chapter B10). If Mission hydroacoustic data are unavailable or unreliable to estimate sockeye abundance due to the dominance of other species, the CPUE data collected at the Whonnock test fishing site can be used in combination with in-river expansion lines (Chapter B3).\nFish caught by the test fisheries, and by commercial fisheries when they occur, are sampled on a regular basis to collect a range of biological information used for in-season assessments (Chapter B5). Biological information includes length, weight and sex information (Chapter B6). Length measurements can be used to supplement stock identification and they are used as inputs into hydroacoustic models to differentiate fish species. Weights are important for understanding fish condition and provide the fishing\n5\n\findustry with information on potential value of fishing opportunities. Biological samples also include DNA and scales that are collected in a procedural manner to ensure up-to-date stock identification data are available for each Panel meeting. Scale data (Chapter B7) provides information about fish age, growth rate and stock identification when DNA estimates are not (yet) available. For stock identification, scales are compared against scales of known stock origin using a linear discriminant analysis in combination with a principal component analysis (Chapter B8). The output from this model provides stock proportions for each sample and stock assignment probabilities for individual sockeye salmon. DNA-based stock identification (Chapter B9) is however the preferred method for identifying salmon stocks. DNA has been used by the PSC since 2002 and uses genetic profiles from fishery catches of unknown stock composition and compares this to a genetic baseline with known stock origin using a Bayesian statistical framework. The genetic identification of salmon stocks is essential for stock-specific reconstructions to assess the total run size and timing by management group (Early Stuart, Early Summer, Summer and Late run sockeye).\nAnother in-season assessment program operated by the PSC is a hydroacoustics program which provides daily estimates of salmon passage in the Fraser River throughout the summer (Chapter B10). Because of the large 400m river width, a combination of four hydroacoustic systems are deployed to adequately monitor the salmon migration past the area. The left bank area, where most of the upstream migration typically occurs, is monitored by a stationary split-beam system (Chapter B11) and an ARIS imaging sonar (Chapter B13) deployed at the end of a fish deflection weir. The ARIS system collects more visually intuitive data but only covers the first 30 meters of the left bank while the split-beam system extends coverage by an additional 30m. The left bank ARIS system increases the accuracy of the left bank, especially during periods of high abundance when the split-beam system has been known to underestimate abundances. The nearshore right bank area is monitored using another ARIS imaging sonar, covers up to 30 meters and typically observes less than 20% of the daily upstream salmon migration. The remaining offshore region is monitored by a mobile, downward-looking split-beam system deployed from a sampling vessel that transects the river (Chapter B14). The information collected from the left-bank and mobile split-beam systems are input into a flux model to estimate fish passage (Chapter B12). These estimates are combined with the data collected by the shore-based imaging sonars to derive the daily salmon estimates. In addition to abundance information, the ARIS systems on both the left and right bank also provide estimates of salmon species composition using a mixture model based on acoustically observed fish lengths (Chapter B15).\nThe total salmon estimates when combined with species composition estimates provide daily sockeye abundance information. Several different data sources and methods exist to derive species composition (Chapter B16) and each has its own shortcomings depending on sample size and the number of species migrating in the river at that time. The daily sockeye abundance estimates can be further split up into abundance of the four different management groups through the application of stock proportion estimates derived from test fishing catch samples taken in the same area (Chapter B17). Stock proportion estimates are also applied to catch and CPUE data. The resulting stock-specific estimates of catch and escapement past Mission are then used in reconstructions (Chapter B18), applied both forwards and backwards. Forward reconstructions predict stock-specific escapement into the river based on marine daily abundances derived from stock-specific CPUE data from marine test fisheries combined with assumptions about migration speed and delay behaviour. Backward reconstructions add stock-specific daily estimates of marine and lower river catches to stock-specific daily escapement estimates to reconstruct the total daily abundance in marine areas. The resulting estimates are used to derive the total run size, marine migration timing and diversion rate.\n6\n\fPrior to all sockeye salmon passing by the riverine hydroacoustic site, in-season run size and timing estimates are obtained through the application of a Bayesian time-density model (Chapter B19) fit to CPUE data from marine gillnet and purse seine test fisheries in Johnstone Strait and Juan de Fuca Strait and reconstructed daily marine abundance estimates. For Harrison and Late run stocks that delay their upstream migration, only marine CPUE are used to assess the run, resulting in larger run size uncertainty in comparison to stocks that also rely on marine reconstructed data. Given the larger uncertainty associated with these Late-run run size estimates and the fact they make up a substantial portion of the total Fraser River sockeye run on the 2018 cycle line, two additional models are used on high abundance years. One of these assessments is referred to as SMURFing (Smolt Method for Updating Run-size Forecasts, Chapter B20) and relies on an in-season run size estimate for Early Thompson and relative smolt abundance estimates collected two years prior for Late Shuswap/Portage versus Early Thompson stocks to predict the run size for Late Shuswap/Portage. It assumes the same marine survival for Late Shuswap/Portage as for Early Thompson. While it does not provide the final in-season run size for Late run stocks, it does provide an early indicator if the run size is smaller or larger than the pre-season forecast. The other assessment method employed on large Late run years relies on CPUE data of a troll test fishery in the Strait of Georgia (Chapter B21) which helps estimate the number of Late run sockeye delaying their upstream migration into the Fraser River. Information collected from this test fishery provides an alternative run size estimate based on escapement into the Fraser River to date, estimated number of delaying fish and estimated abundance seaward of the troll test fishery. Both these assessment methods are only used on years with large Late-run abundances, i.e., Late Shuswap return years, and help with the in-season planning of potential fisheries.\nAn additional component the Fraser River Panel considers when planning fisheries are potential en route losses due to adverse migration conditions within the Fraser River. To increase the likelihood of achieving spawning escapement targets for the four management groups, the Panel uses Management Adjustments (MA, Chapter B22) which are the additional fish allocated to escape fisheries for the purpose of increasing the likelihood of achieving these targets. To select appropriate MA values, the Panel will take into account observed and predicted estimates of temperature and discharge within the Fraser River (Chapter B23) and other factors that can cause adverse migration conditions and differences between predicted and observed spawning ground estimates (DBEs, difference between estimates). In-season DBE predictions for Early Stuart, Early Summer and Summer run sockeye are also generated through a DBE temperature and discharge model (Chapter B24) where 19-day mean water temperature and discharge observations in the Fraser River are related to historical DBE data. Late run sockeye, excluding Birkenhead and Big Silver, traditionally delay their upstream migration. Early entry into the Fraser River since 1995 has however resulted in extended freshwater residence times, increased exposure to higher river temperature and discharge and increased mortality (Lapointe et al. 2003, Cooke et al. 2004). The DBE run timing model (Chapter B25) to predict the DBE for these stocks relates upstream migration timing to migration success, i.e., to DBE estimates. Early predictions of upstream migration timing in turn are based on the historic relationship between the proportion upstream migration to-date and upstream timing.\nIn-season fisheries opportunities are determined by the availability of International total allowable catch (TAC, Chapter B26). This is calculated as the Fraser River sockeye abundance available after the spawning escapement target (SET), the Management Adjustment (MA), the agreed Aboriginal Fisheries Exemption (AFE) and the expected catch in panel authorized test fisheries are deducted. If there is sockeye abundance available for harvest, the United States share will not exceed 16.5 percent of the sockeye TAC. The remaining TAC in addition to AFE catches are assigned to Canada.\n7\n\fA. Preseason Planning\n8\n\fPre-season planning: pre-season management information\nA1. Run Size Forecast\nJ.A. Gill, M.J. Hague, and A. Phung\nSummary Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) provides run size forecasts to the Pacific Salmon Commission (PSC) as part of their obligations under the Pacific Salmon Treaty (Chapter 4, Paragraph 4). Forecasted returns of Fraser River sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) stocks based on historical stock-recruitment data are a key input into pre-season planning for fisheries. Prior to the start of the season, run size forecasts are used directly in calculations of management objectives (e.g. spawning escapement targets, total allowable catch, Chapter A4) and in simulations of alternative fishing scenarios (Chapter A6). These forecasts also play an important role in the early in-season management of Fraser River sockeye salmon, prior to the availability of updated estimates based on in-season information and are utilized throughout the fishing season as informative prior distributions for stock assessment models (Chapter B19).\nIndividual return forecasts are generated for 27 component stocks, and then aggregated into four management groups: Early Stuart, Early Summer, Summer and Late run. Run sizes are forecasted using traditional stock-recruit models (e.g. Ricker, Larkin) unless recruitment data are lacking, in which case average survival estimates from related stocks are relied upon (Cass et al. 2006). Selection of the model used to forecast a stock is based on a retrospective evaluation of the performance of the multiple models and subsequent ranking of the models based on various performance and selection criteria. Given the uncertainty in the modelled stock-recruit relationships, a Bayesian approach is used to generate posterior probability distributions of run size for the various component stocks. Sensitivity of management decisions to alternative run size scenarios can then be evaluated by drawing different quantiles from the posterior distributions.\nIntroduction Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) provides run size forecasts prior to the fishing season to the Pacific Salmon Commission (PSC) as part of their obligations under the Pacific Salmon Treaty (PST 2020, Chapter 4). Individual return forecasts are generated for 27 component stocks, and then aggregated into four management groups: Early Stuart, Early Summer, Summer, and Late run. Despite the uncertainty associated with run size forecasts based on historical stock-recruitment data, the forecasted distributions of run size for different stocks and management groups of Fraser River sockeye play an important role in the pre-season planning and in-season assessments of stock size. Run size forecasts for Fraser River sockeye are a key input into DFO’s Integrated Fisheries Management Plan, or IFMP (DFO 2018b). Key management objectives such as total allowable catch (TAC), spawning escapement targets (SET), management adjustments (MAs), low abundance exploitation rates (LAERs), and aboriginal fisheries exemptions (AFEs) are all directly influenced by the size of aggregate returns for each management group. In addition, the PSC utilizes both the run size forecasts and associated management inputs to evaluate the sensitivity of fishing plans and the probability of achieving management objectives across a range of run size scenarios using a fisheries simulation model. Prior to the availability\n9\n\fPre-season planning: pre-season management information\nof in-season data which are used to refine estimates of run size and timing, early management decisions rely on the results of the pre-season simulations to evaluate catch proposals made by each country. Finally, while the Fraser River Panel typically adopts updated run sizes based on in-season stock assessments, the stock-specific forecasts and the mean and standard deviation (SD) of the probability distributions provided by DFO pre-season continue to be used as priors in Bayesian run size assessments.\nData Detailed descriptions of the data used to forecast Fraser River sockeye salmon run size can be found in Grant et al. (2010) and Cass et al. (2006). Time series of stock recruit data are currently available for 20 of the 27 forecasted stocks. The majority rely on spawning escapement and estimates of returns by age, while some also have historical time series of juvenile abundance in terms of fry or smolts (Grant et al. 2010, Table 1). Spawning escapement is usually quantified as the number of females contributing to the spawning population based on potential egg deposition (i.e., effective females spawners (EFS), Cass et al. 2006). The one exception is the Cultus Lake population where estimates of EFS are poorly determined; therefore, total adult escapement data are used instead (Cass et al. 2006). Stocks identified in the forecast as miscellaneous rely solely on historical timeseries of escapement data to generate the forecast given their lack of sufficient recruitment information (Table 1).\nMost Fraser sockeye stocks are comprised of four year old salmon that entered the ocean at age 2 (42 sockeye) and five year old salmon that have spent an additional year in the ocean (52). The total forecasted recruitment in a given year is therefore based on the sum of the estimated number of 4 and 5-year-old recruits from different brood years. For Fraser River sockeye salmon, only the Harrison stock has a different age structure as they enter the ocean as one-year old smolts and the resulting recruitment forecast is comprised of forecasted estimates of 3 and 4-year-old salmon (31 and 41 sockeye).\nIn addition to biological data, environmental covariates are used to improve the fit of traditional stock- recruit models. These variables include mean winter (November-March) indices from the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), mean spring-summer (April-July) sea surface temperatures collected at Entrance or Pine Island, and Fraser River peak and mean discharge from April to June measured in Hope (Grant et al. 2010).\nMethods A wide range of different models are considered for the forecast (Tab) of Fraser River sockeye salmon run size. Detailed descriptions and model structures of the pre-season run size forecast models can be found in MacDonald and Grant (2012), Grant et al. (2010) and Cass et al. (2006). The complexity of the forecast models is dependent on data available for each stock. Non-biological models, which are also termed naïve models as they assume no underlying biological mechanism, calculate return forecasts based on historical estimates of returns or returns per effective female spawner or per juvenile (MacDonald and Grant 2012). These models rely on historical years or a subset of years or, in case data for a stock are missing (e.g., miscellaneous stocks), on historical data from other stocks are used as proxy (DFO 2018a).\nBiological models are used when sufficient stock-specific spawner-recruitment data are available. Biological models are based on a relationship between spawning escapement or juvenile abundance and subsequent recruitment and include: 1) Ricker models (Ricker 1954); 2) power models; 3) Larkin models; 4) Kalman filter models; and 4) sibling models (MacDonald and Grant 2012). The Kalman filter models account for changes in productivity over time while the sibling models rely on the return of a younger\n10\n\fPre-season planning: pre-season management information\nage class one year prior to predict returns of the older age class to account for shared productivity between siblings. The various biological models may also include environmental variables as covariates, which are especially of use when recruits encountered extreme environmental conditions during earlier parts of their life history. Uncertainty in parameter estimates and the resulting return size forecasts are quantified by estimating Bayesian posterior probability distributions using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations run through WinBUGS software (DFO 2015).\nBoth non-biological and biological models produce estimates of the total number of recruits, irrespective of the age and year in which they return to the Fraser River for spawning. To determine the total number of returning sockeye salmon in a given year, the recruitment forecasts need to be split up by age using age proportion estimates based on historical data. Age-specific recruitment is calculated by multiplying the total return forecast by historical age proportions (Appendix 3 in Grant et al. 2010, MacDonald and Grant 2012). In years of high expected proportions of age-five fish (or age-four fish for the Harrison stock), sibling models are used to forecast returns of the older age group based on the productivity calculated for their younger siblings that returned the previous year.\nThe selection of the model used to forecast a stock is based on a retrospective evaluation of the performance of the different models and subsequent model ranking based on various performance criteria. A jack-knife cross validation analysis is used to simulate forecasted time series of each stock and model based on historical data. In the jack-knife analysis, data are sequentially removed for the single year being forecast and the remaining stock-recruitment data are used to fit the model and generate a forecasted run size (MacDonald and Grant 2012). For each model, the resulting time series of forecasted run sizes are compared against historical observations through the calculation of a suite of model performance measures: 1) mean raw error (MRE), 2) mean absolute error (MAE), 3) mean proportional error (MPE), and 4) root mean square error (RMSE; Grant et al. 2010). For each stock, the relative performance across models is calculated by applying a rank (from best to worst) for each metric (Grant et al. 2010), and then averaging the ranks of individual model ranks across the performance metrics to generate a single performance index for each model (MacDonald and Grant 2012). In addition to the quantitative selection process, the forecast methodology also relies on a set of additional model selection criteria (MacDonald and Grant 2012, Hawkshaw et al. 2020). The results of the top ranked models are presented to a group of technical experts, who will review the model results for the individual stocks as well as the model selection criteria across stocks. These expert driven model selection criteria are adjusted annually as needed and reported in the forecast document (Hawkshaw et al. 2020).\nResults Uncertainty in the forecast results is expressed in terms of a probability distribution which is described in the forecast document (i.e., DFO 2019) in terms the following percentiles: 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 90%. The median forecast (50th percentile, or p50) represents an equal chance (i.e., a one in two chance) that the return will fall above or below the forecast value for each stock (Grant et al. 2010, DFO 2018a; Table 3). In comparison, there is a one in four chance that the actual number of returning sockeye salmon will fall at or below the forecast associated with the 25th percentile (p25 probability level). Within the current forecast methodology, the p50 forecast assumes long term average productivity will be maintained, the p10 and p25 forecasts assume below average productivity, while the p75 and p90 forecasts assume above average productivity (Grant et al. 2010).\nTable 3 list the various forecasted stocks, the model used to generate that forecast, and percentiles that define the forecast. For example, the Weaver stock (Table 3) in the Late run management group was forecasted using a Ricker model with the PDO as an environmental covariate. At the 10% (p10)\n11\n\fPre-season planning: pre-season management information\nprobability level, there is a one in ten chance that the actual return will fall at or below 38,000 fish, while at the 90% (p90) probability level, there is a one in ten chance the actual return will be above 655,000.\nPlanned Changes and Potential Areas for Improvement As additional years of stock-recruit data become available, the performance of the pre-season run size models are subject to change. Sockeye returns in recent years have been well below the median forecast, which has resulted in overly optimistic pre-season plans and which points to a need to re- evaluate model performance and/or adjust expectations for pre-season planning (DFO 2019). The positive bias in recent run size forecasts could be a result of many different factors, but DFO recommends a re-evaluation of the model performance given the lower than average productivity observed across most stocks in recent years (DFO 2019). The ability to relate changes in marine survival to environmental indices could also help improve forecasts (DFO 2019). A CSAS review of the forecast methodology has been planned for the near future.\nIn addition, advances in DNA technology, in combination with increased abundance of some stocks, has allowed the number of stocks for which spawner-recruitment are available to increase (e.g. Chilliwack). These advances allow for additional forecasting methods be used for these stocks, potentially lowering uncertainty associated with the forecast.\nFinally, there has been some criticism of the simplified approach of summing total returns across individual forecasts by summing the probability levels. For example, the p25 forecast for all Fraser River sockeye stocks combined is currently based on the sum of the p25 forecast of the individual stocks. This approach assumes that stocks will all return at the same probability level (i.e., variation over time is fully correlated). A more statistically valid approach would be to incorporate the observed correlation in run size estimates between the component stocks (DFO 2019).\n12\n\fEarly Stuart\nEarly Summer\nSummer\nSummer continued\nLate\nAdditional data\nFry (not used in forecast)\nFry (not used in forecast) Fry\nScotch/Seymour R/EFS\nused as proxy\nEarly Summer-run stocks R/EFS used as proxy Early Summer-run stocks R/EFS used as proxy\nSmolt\nFall Fry Fry (not used in forecast)\nRaft and Fennel R/EFS used as proxy Raft and Fennel R/EFS used as proxy\nPre-season planning: pre-season management information\nTable 1.

Timing and Diversion Rate Forecasts\nJ.A. Gill, M.J. Hague and A. Phung\nSummary Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) provides the Pacific Salmon Commission with annual forecasts of the migration timing, and migration route around Vancouver Island in accordance with the Pacific Salmon Treaty. These forecasts are based on a series of different statistical models that include various environmental covariates. These models are evaluated retrospectively to assess the bias and precision of the forecast. The results of the top performing models are reduced to single forecasts by bootstrap sampling from the probability distributions of the different model forecasts. The uncertainty around the forecast is presented by reporting the 95% probability interval in addition to the median. The resulting preseason forecasts of timing and migration routes are important for pre-season expectations of abundance and planning of fisheries (Chapter A6) and serve as informative prior probability distribution inputs into the in-season stock assessment models (Chapter B19). DFO provides timing forecasts for Early Stuart and Chilko stocks, while diversion rates are produced for the aggregate Fraser River sockeye run. Work to increase the stock resolution of the timing and diversion rate forecasts is ongoing.\nIntroduction Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) produces annual forecasts of the marine migration timing and migration route around Vancouver Island as part of their obligations under the Pacific Salmon Treaty (PSC 2019, Chapter 4, Folkes et al. 2018). Marine timing for Fraser River sockeye is defined as the date when 50% of a stock has passed through the marine areas on route to their natal freshwater stream for spawning (Folkes et al. 2017, Figure 1). It is common to use the DFO statistical area 20 (Area 20) in Juan de Fuca Strait as the reference location for the marine timing (Chapter B18). The Area 20 timing then refers to the date when 50% of a stock has passed Area 20 assuming the entire run migrated through Juan de Fuca Strait. The use of the Area 20 as a refence point for timing is largely due to the fact that IPFSC historically used catch data collected from the southern migration route to derive marine migration timing (Folkes et al. 2018). DFO only produces timing forecasts for the Early Stuart and Chilko stocks. PSC staff uses the correlations between timing estimates or the timing offsets between stocks to derive timing forecast of the other Fraser River sockeye stocks. The diversion rate refers the route an individual salmon might take to return to the Fraser River to spawn (Folkes et al. 2018). More specifically, the (northern) diversion rate indicates the proportion of the salmon that migrates through Johnstone Strait (northern approach) as opposed to Juan de Fuca Strait (southern approach, Figure 2). Estimates may reflect the diversion over a week or a few days or across the entire migration season. Diversion rates have traditionally been derived for the total Fraser River sockeye aggregate but could also be derived for individual stocks or management groups. The forecasts of timing and diversion rate can be combined with the pre-season run size forecasts and historical estimates of the length of the returning run (spread) to derive forecasts of daily abundances migrating through Juan de Fuca and Johnstone Strait.\n17\n\fPre-season planning: pre-season management information\nFigure 1. Example of the method used to estimate marine timing, based on reconstructed abundance data. The marine timing is the date when the cumulative daily abundance exceeds 50% of the total abundance (horizontal dashed line) and is denoted by the vertical arrow (adapted from Folkes et al. 2018).\nFigure 2. Southern B.C. coast map depicting the two routes taken by adult Fraser sockeye when returning to the Fraser River.

The timing is defined as the date when the cumulative abundance of these stock exceeds 50% of the total run size. Annual post-season estimates of northern diversion rate of the aggregate Fraser River sockeye population are estimated by dividing the total abundance migrating through the northern (Johnstone Strait) approach by the total abundance. (Folkes et al. 2018). Prior to 1995, estimates of diversion rate were based on commercial fishery catches along both migration routes (Folkes et al. 2018). Commercial catches of Fraser River sockeye started declining after 1995. Therefore, recent estimates of diversion are based on catch per unit effort (CPUE) data from test fisheries operating in Juan de Fuca and Johnstone Straits (Putman et al. 2014).\nIn addition to relying on historical estimates of migration timing and diversion rate, the methods to forecast these estimates also rely on environmental data that are assumed to impact timing and diversion. The full suite of environmental data used in Folkes et al. (2018) include three El Niño indices (Oceanic Niño Index (ONI), Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), and the Bivariate ENSO Timeseries (BEST)), Fraser River discharge, relative sea level, sea surface temperature (in the open ocean and near-shore), sea surface salinity, wind stress, ocean current velocity (from both the NEPSTAR (North East Pacific Salmon Tracking and Research) ocean model and the OSCAR (Ocean Surface Current Analysis Real-time) data series), and earth magnetic field estimates (intensity and inclination, Table 1).\nTable 1.

These models range from naïve models that rely on historical data to linear regression models, generalized additive models (GAM) and shape constrained additive models (SCAM) that include environmental covariates (Table 1) at different levels of resolution (Folkes et al. 2017, Folkes et al. 2018). Using jack- knife and retrospective analyses, models are ranked annually against five performance measures to determine their ability to provide precise and unbiased predictions: mean raw error, absolute mean raw error, absolute mean error, mean square error, root mean squared error. The models to derive the forecasts are selected based on user tolerance of model uncertainty (Folkes et al. 2018). The results of the various models are reduced to a single forecast by bootstrap sampling from the probability distributions of the different model forecasts. The uncertainty around the forecast is presented by reporting the 50% and 95% probability intervals in addition to the median.\nTable 2. The statistical models used to forecast migration timing or diversion rate (from Folkes et al. 2018).\nForecasts in each year are dependent on the performance of individual models and the available data. From an assessment point of view, there are three time periods for which forecasts are required: preliminary planning in February and April, updated planning in June and in-season assessments in July and August. At the time of the preseason planning in February, the forecast of timing and diversion rates are usually based on naïve models that account for differences between cycle line years. Models that include environmental covariates are only used in June as environmental data collected closer to the season has a better ability to predict timing and diversion. In-season these forecasts will be used as informative prior probability distributions within the in-season stock assessment models.\nDFO only produces timing estimates for Early Stuart and Chilko. PSC staff uses the correlations between timing estimates or the timing offsets between stocks to produce timing forecast for the remainder of the stock groups modelled preseason and in-season. The Retrospective Evaluation Framework (REF) tool was created to standardize how decisions on pre-season migration timing are made. The REF tool allows PSC staff to retrospectively evaluate methods to obtain migration timing estimates across different stocks and cycle lines.\n20\nForecastModel TypeStatistical ModelTiming or DiversionNaiveSeries meanTiming or DiversionNaiveFour year meanTiming or DiversionNaiveEight year meanTiming or DiversionNaiveSeries medianTiming or DiversionNaiveFour year medianTiming or DiversionNaiveEight year medianTiming or DiversionNaiveLike last yearTiming or DiversionFittedAuto regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) Timing or DiversionFittedSingle variable linear regressionTiming or DiversionFittedSingle variable GAMTiming or DiversionFittedSingle variable shape constrained generalized additive model (SCAM)Timing or DiversionFittedNepstar MLRTiming or DiversionFittednon-Nepstar MLRDiversionFittedMLR (Wickett model)\n\fPre-season planning: pre-season management information\nResults Timing forecasts are provided by DFO for both Early Stuart and Chilko stocks. Table 3 is an example of these forecasts for Chilko (Folkes et al. 2019a). The table lists the seven models that ranked highest in terms of model performance: four were naïve models including two auto regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models and three were multivariate models with environmental covariates. The forecast models are described in terms of the year and month in which the environmental data was collected that they rely on to produce the forecast, e.g. March [3] of the previous year [-1] or June [6] of the current year [0]. For covariates that are model derived, the description will also include details of the data used such as northward current velocity [v], eastward current velocity [u] and wind stress [n]. The last row of the table contains the bootstrapping results that combines the forecasts from the different models. The forecast is presented in terms of the median and the 50 and 95% probability intervals (PI). In this example the median timing forecast for Chilko is August 10 and the 95% probability interval ranges from August 1 to August 19, meaning that there is a 5% chance the actual migration timing will fall outside this range. The table to describe the diversion rate forecast (Table 4) is similar to the timing forecast. In this case, one naïve model and six multivariate models were used to produce the forecast (Folkes et al. 2019b). When converting the annual Fraser River sockeye diversion rate forecast into daily estimates, it is important to take into account the general trend towards increased northern diversion as the season progresses (Figure 3).\nTable 3.

Pre-season forecasts of the annual northern diversion rate (DR) for Fraser River sockeye salmon (green dotted line), compared to in-season estimates of daily and annual rates.\nPlanned Changes and Potential Areas for Improvement Daily reconstructed abundance estimates are used to derive migration timing and diversion rate estimates. Historical reconstruction files however vary in stock-resolution, file structure, and data assumptions, leading to inconsistencies in stock specific timing and diversion rate estimates across years. Therefore, the historical reconstruction file system will be reworked with the aim to standardize file assumptions, increase the stock and spatial resolution of reconstructed abundances, and populate a run reconstruction database. Upon completion, it will be possible to query the resulting database to obtain improved yearly timing estimates at varying stock resolution as well as obtain annual and in- season diversion rate estimates at different stock resolution. The newly developed REF tool (Retrospective Evaluation Framework) will be used to analyze, validate and document differences in historical versus updated timing and diversion rate estimates.\nReferences Folkes, M., Thompson, R., and Hourston, R. 2019a.

Hague\nSummary The Management Adjustment (MA) refers to the additional fish added to an escapement target to increase the likelihood of achieving that target and takes into account en route loss and other factors that cause differences between predicted and observed escapement estimates (DBEs, differences between estimates). Early pre-season planning relies on historic DBE data to forecast DBEs while immediately prior to the season in June, statistical models are used to predict DBEs. For Early Stuart, Early Summer and Summer-run sockeye, statistical models use forecasted Fraser River temperature at Qualark, B.C. and Fraser River discharge at Hope, B.C. fit to a historical timeseries of escapement discrepancies to generate pre-season DBE predictions. For Late-run the statistical model is fit to upstream timing (the 50% date at Mission) to generate the pre-season predictions of DBEs. Despite the associated uncertainty, preseason DBE forecasts provide managers with an early indication of the expected discrepancy between the potential spawning escapement (PSE) and the spawning escapement (SE). This facilitates a more informed decision-making process and allows the Fraser Panel to be proactive in adopting MA estimates in response to adverse environmental conditions and adjust the fishing pressure to increase the probability of achieving spawning escapement targets.\nIntroduction Under the Pacific Salmon Treaty, the Fraser River Panel has the discretion to add additional fish to the spawning escapement target (SET) set by Canada for Fraser River sockeye salmon (O. nerka) to ensure spawning requirements are met (PST, Article IV, Chapter 4, Paragraph 3b). The additional fish added to the escapement targets for the different management units of Fraser River sockeye are termed the Management Adjustments (MAs) and they are used for the purpose of increasing the likelihood of achieving the SET. The idea is that extra fish are allowed to escape upriver of Mission to account for anticipated negative differences between in-season versus post-season estimates of spawning escapement caused by en route mortality due to poor environmental conditions during upstream migration, such as high discharge levels and warmer water temperatures. The differences between in- season and post-season estimates can however also stem from biases in the in-season and post-season assessments and the resulting catch and spawner estimates. In this case, the resulting bias can both be positive or negative.\nFor pre-season planning, it is important to make accurate assumptions about the Management Adjustment to ensure the SETs are met. Practically, this means managers must predict the likely difference between estimates (DBE). Depending on the available data, either historical data or statistical models are used to predict DBEs. Prior to June, managers use median values from the historical dataset for each management group. In June, when long-range forecasts of temperature and discharge are available, the DBEs are predicted using statistical models that relate historical DBEs to environmental river conditions. These models are similar to the in-season DBE models that rely on shorter range temperature and discharge forecasts. Historically, when discharge levels or temperatures are above average, DBEs also tend to be high. In addition, for Early Stuart and Early Summer runs, in-season estimates are consistently higher than spawning ground estimates even when migration conditions are within normal ranges, and this tendency is also captured by the DBE models. For Late-run sockeye,\n24\n\fPre-season planning: pre-season management information\nhistorical DBEs are related to the date when half the run has migrated past Mission (i.e., Mission 50% date), which captures the negative impact of the early migration behaviour observed since the mid- 1990s on the migration success of these stocks (Lapointe et al. 2003, Cooke et al. 2004).\nData The in-season and post-season spawning escapement estimates, the 50% migration dates at Hells Gate and Mission and the temperature and discharge at Hells Gate are the primary biological data used to predict DBEs. These are used as inputs in the statistical models (Chapter B24). Hells Gate is used as the geographic reference point to describe Fraser River environmental conditions because it is a well-known impediment to successful upstream salmon migration.\nThe DBE data are derived from the historical differences between in-season projections of spawning escapement (i.e., Mission escapement minus catch above Mission, or “potential spawning escapement, PSE”) and post-season estimates (i.e., spawning ground estimates, “spawning escapement, SE”).\nThe 50% Hells Gate date for Early Stuart, Early Summer and Summer run are used to determine the mean temperature and discharge experienced by the management group across 31 days. The 50% date at Mission for Late run is used in the DBE run timing model (Chapter B25). The 50% migration date at Hells Gate or Mission for the different management groups is the date at which 50% of that group has passed these locations in the Fraser River. The Hells Gate and Mission dates are derived from marine migration timing estimates in statistical Area 20, Juan de Fuca Strait (Chapter A2). The travel time from Area 20 to Mission is assumed to be 6 days for Early Stuart, Early Summer and Summer run sockeye. The Late run sockeye travel time to Mission depends on their delay before up-stream migration but is assumed to be 8 days when travelling without delay. The travel time from Mission to Hells Gate is assumed to be 5 days for the Early Stuart, Summer and Late run sockeye and only 4 days for the Early Summer run sockeye.\nPre-season, the long-range forecasts for temperature and discharge are provided to PSC staff by Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) Environmental Watch Program (Patterson et al. 2007, Chapter B23). In combination with predicted migration timing forecast, the daily estimates of the long-range forecast allow to create 31-day mean Fraser River temperature forecasts at Qualark, B.C. and 31-day mean Fraser River discharge forecasts at Hope, B.C. (Morrison 2005, Morrison et al. 2005, Hague et al. 2014). These long-range forecasts are provided by the DFO Environmental Watch Program in June in the form of 10,000 paired predictions of Fraser River discharge and temperature that capture the uncertainty associated with these forecasts. In addition to the long-range forecast, the pre-season DBE models also use historical Fraser River temperature and discharge estimates. The DFO Environmental Watch group maintains a database of these data and an updated copy of historical observed Fraser River temperature at Qualark and discharge at Hope are provided to the PSC annually.\nMethods\nPREDICTIONS USING MEDIAN VALUES\nPre-season planning begins in early February. At this time, reliable long-range environmental forecasts are not yet available and early pre-season MAs are therefore based on median values of historical datasets. Median values are calculated by using the time series of ln(PSE/SE) data. This median is then converted to a pMA (proportional MA) using the following equation:\n\n\n\n𝑝𝑀𝐴 = [𝑒𝑥𝑝 (\n𝑃𝑆𝐸\n𝑆𝐸\n) − 1]\n25\n\fPre-season planning: pre-season management information\nThe pMA is converted to the official pDBE (proportional DBE, rounded to two decimal places) using the following equation:\n\n\n\n𝑝𝐷𝐵𝐸 = [\n1 (1+𝑝𝑀𝐴)\n− 1]\nFor some management groups, like Early Stuart and Summer run, there have been no substantial differences detected between the pDBEs of different cycle lines. Therefore, the median pDBE has been based on all historical years. The pDBEs for Early Summer-run and Late-run groups often vary depending on the cycle line. For example, in Dominant or Subdominant Early South Thompson years, pDBEs may differ substantially from the pDBEs on off-cycle years, indicating that the response of this group to negative environmental conditions differs depending on their abundance. Therefore, the Early Summer- run dataset might be reduced to only Dominant or Dominant and Subdominant years when calculating the median pDBE for those years. Similarly, the datasets can also be reduced to odd pink years or cycle line years if pDBEs on those years differ from other years. However, this significantly reduces the number of data points used to calculate the median.\nMODEL PREDICTIONS USING LONG TERM ENVIRONMENTAL FORECASTS\nIn June, pDBE predictions are based on statistical DBE models using long-range forecasts of river conditions in combination with in-river migration timing predictions to produce current year forecasts. For Early Stuart, Early Summer and Summer-run sockeye, these models are regression models relating freshwater conditions defined by temperature (T) and discharge (Q) to differences between estimates (MacDonald et al. 2010). The forecasted 31-day mean T and Q centered around the 50% date at Hells Gate is used as a model input to forecast the DBE for the current year. These DBE timing and discharge models are run separately for each management group and are based on each group’s 50% date at Hell’s Gate. The 31-day model captures 90% or more of a run’s exposure to environmental conditions at Hell’s Gate and provides a better fit to the historical DBE data than environmental data averaged over a shorter time-period (Hague et al. 2007).\nFor Late-run sockeye the statistical model is a regression model that relates early upstream migration to differences between estimates. The DBE run-timing model prediction is based on a pre-season prediction of upstream timing, which is dependent on the number of days the salmon delay in the Strait of Georgia. The estimate of delay is based on historical delay patterns for the different cycle lines. Due to the uncertainty in the upstream timing estimate, the Panel is often presented with a range of DBE predictions using multiple upstream timing dates before and after the current estimate. In recent years, the Panel has agreed to use the adopted pre-season median unless in-season timing is later than a specific date. The date is determined by the date at which the DBE prediction from the run-timing model using all years is lower than the adopted median DBE.\nResults In February, management considerations for the upcoming season are presented to the Panel. The preliminary pDBE estimates for consideration by the Fraser River Panel at this time are based on the median pDBEs. These very preliminary pDBEs are used by PSC staff to seed the planning model and by DFO in the preliminary escapement plan. In April the preliminary pDBEs are reviewed again with possible changes depending on updated information and Fraser River Panel guidance. The resulting pMAs are then used for all of the April planning model work. In June, the DFO Environmental Watch group provides the pre-season long-range forecasts of temperature and discharge and PSC staff use the environmental models to forecast the pDBE for Early Stuart, Early Summer run and Summer run sockeye. The Panel may choose to adopt (if either party accepts) or not adopt (if both parties reject) the\n26\n\fPre-season planning: pre-season management information\nrecommended pDBEs or may choose a different value as they see fit (by bilateral agreement). The adopted pMA is then used in the pre-season planning model for in-season fisheries management until the Panel adopts an in-season pMA.\nPlanned Changes and Potential Areas for Improvement There is quite a lot of uncertainty associated with the pDBE forecast estimates as well as the long-range preseason temperature and discharge forecast estimates used as inputs into the model. This has caused some reluctance from the part of the Fraser River Panel to adopt preseason DBEs based long-range environmental forecasts. Instead the Panel has often preferred to rely on historical data when preseason planning.\nThe current T & Q models predict a DBE for each management group but do not incorporate group specific information despite known differences in tolerances to adverse migration conditions (Eliason et al. 2011).\nMAs are only of relevance if there is a potential for a harvestable surplus. In years when preseason run size estimates are too low for a harvestable surplus, management adjustments have no management consequences and are therefore not adopted by the Fraser River Panel.\nReferences Cooke, S.J., Hinch, S.G., Farrell, A.P., Lapointe, M.F., Jones, S.R.M., Macdonald, J.S., Patterson, D.A., Healey, M.C. and Van Der Kraak, G.

Pre-season Fraser River Sockeye Spawning Escapement Plan\nC.G.J. Michielsens\nSummary Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) provides pre-season escapement plans to the Pacific Salmon Commission (PSC) as part of their obligations under the Pacific Salmon Treaty (Chapter 4, Paragraph 4). Long-term escapement strategies for Fraser River sockeye stocks are derived through the FRSSI (Fraser River Sockeye Spawning Initiative) process and vetted through domestic consultation. The simulation model used as part of the process evaluates the performance of different control rules and assesses their robustness to different sources of uncertainty such as assumptions about population dynamics and future patterns of productivity. The resulting escapement plan is defined in terms of a TAM (Total Allowable Mortality) rule that accounts for both fishing and natural mortality due to adverse environmental conditions en route to the spawning grounds. The TAM rules for the different management groups are defined by Lower and Upper Fishery Reference Points, TAM caps and Low Abundance Exploitation rates (LAERs). The use of TAM rules as part of the escapement plan results in dynamic escapement goals that are updated repeatedly in-season based on updated information on run size and adopted Management Adjustments (MAs). The resulting TAC (Total Allowable Catch) is calculated as the aggregated Fraser River sockeye abundance available after the escapement target, the Management Adjustment, the agreed Fraser River Aboriginal Exemption and the expected catch in Panel-authorized test fisheries are deducted from the pre-season run size forecasts.\nIntroduction As part of Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) obligations under the Pacific Salmon Treaty (PST 2020, Chapter 4), escapement targets are provided to the Pacific Salmon Commission (PSC) prior to the fishing season. These spawning escapement targets are defined through an escapement plan that takes into account the run size as well as adverse environmental conditions that could reduce the probability of reaching those targets. The latter is achieved by increasing the escapement by adding fish to the target in the form of a Management Adjustment (MA, MacDonald et al. 2010). The escapement plan has been derived though the Fraser River Sockeye Spawning Initiative (FRSSI), a multi-year collaborative planning process by DFO to develop a long-term escapement strategy (Pestal et al. 2008). The simulation model that is part of the FRSSI process allows for the evaluation of the performance of different escapement strategies through the application of different harvest control rules. In addition, it explores the robustness of these strategies to different key sources of uncertainty such as possible alternative population dynamics and future patterns of productivity. The use of a harvest control rule as part of the escapement plan result in dynamic escapement goals that are updated repeatedly during the fishing season from updated information on run size and in-season environmental conditions (Pestal et al. 2012).\n29\n\fPre-season planning: pre-season management information\nData The simulation model used within the FRSSI process is populated using the stock-recruitment data for 19 distinct Fraser River sockeye stocks that, on average, make up 98.6% of the total sockeye run for the Fraser River (Pestal et al. 2007). These data are also used for the forecast and are described in detail in Grant et al. (2010). The majority of the stocks rely on spawning escapement and estimates of returns by age, while some stocks also have historical time series of juvenile abundance in terms of fry or smolts (Grant et al. 2010).\nMethods The simulation model developed as part of the FRSSI process aims to evaluate the long-term performance of different harvest control rules under a wide range of alternative biological assumptions and hypothesized future states of nature (Chaput et al. 2013). The model includes 19 different stocks, grouped into 4 management units (Early Stuart, Early Summer run, Summer run and Late run). The abundance of the stocks is simulated into the future based on historical stock-recruitment relationships. The simulation models differ depending on the assumptions they make on the population dynamics of the stocks, which includes different assumptions about stock-recruit relationships and interactions between cycle lines, different future trends in productivity and natural mortality. Within the simulations, the different population dynamic scenarios are used to evaluate specific escapement strategies for the different management groups based on a control rule. The outputs from the model simulations are used to track the status of each individual stock.\nFor Fraser River sockeye salmon, the ability to reach escapement goals is not only impacted by fisheries but also by mortality caused by adverse environmental conditions. The control rule for Fraser River sockeye is therefore formulated in terms of a TAM (Total Allowable Mortality) rule (Figure 1) and accounts both for fishing and natural mortality. The TAM rule is defined by a Lower Fishery Reference Point, an Upper Fishery Reference Point, a TAM cap and a Low Abundance Exploitation rate (LAER). When the in-season run size is below the Lower Fishery Reference Point, no directed ﬁsheries are allowed; only incidental harvest, directed at co-migrating stocks, is permitted. This incidental harvest needs to remain well below the Low Abundance Exploitation rate. In case the in-season run-size estimate is above the Upper Fishery Reference Point, the Total Allowable Mortality (TAM) rate remains ﬁxed at the TAM cap. The projected MA is subtracted from the TAM to calculate the final allowable ER calculation (DFO 2018). Between the Lower and Upper Fishery Reference Points, a ﬁxed escapement target, equal to the Lower Fishery Reference Point, is assumed. The different components of the TAM rule are derived through the simulation modelling and the FRSSI process and vetted through domestic consultation (Chaput et al. 2013). The pre-season TAC (Total Allowable Catch) is derived using the TAM rule and calculated as the aggregated Fraser River sockeye abundance available after the escapement target, the management adjustment, the agreed Fraser River Aboriginal Exemption and the expected catch in Panel-authorized test fishing catch are deducted from the pre-season run size forecast.\n30\n\fPre-season planning: pre-season management information\nFigure 1. Graphical presentation of the Total Allowable Mortality rule for Fraser River sockeye salmon (DFO 2018). The Lower Fishery Reference Point is here represented as the No-Fishing Point while the Upper Reference Point is represented as the Cut-back Point. The Low Abundance Exploitation Rate (LAER) is applied after the TAM rule and is not shown in the figure.\nResults The FRSSI process results in the creation of a pre-season spawning escapement plan (Table 1). The top table of Table 1 describes the TAM rule: the low abundance exploitation rate (LAER), the TAM Cap, the Lower and the upper Fishery Reference Points and the pre-season pMA at the p50 level Fraser River sockeye forecast. The subsequent tables illustrate the application of the TAM rule for different run size forecast levels for each of the four management groups. More specifically, at the different forecast levels, the table will provide the % TAM implied by the forecast level (TAM rule (%)), the number of fish added to the escapement target based on the assumed pMA (Escapement Target MA), the sum of the escapement target and the MA, the low abundance exploitation rate, and the available exploitation rate given the run size, escapement target and MA. If the run size is smaller than the escapement target plus MA, the available exploitation rate is 0%. If the available exploitation rate exceeds the LAER, the allowable exploitation rate will equal the available rate. If the available exploitation rate is lower than the LAER, the allowable exploitation rate will equal the LAER but it should be emphasized that a LAER is not a target but allows for by-catch of a management group in fisheries directed at other management\n31\n\fPre-season planning: pre-season management information\ngroups or species with available surpluses. Table 1 also translates the allowable exploitation rate into the number of sockeye available to be harvested. In order to translate this into a TAC (Total allowable catch) for the aggregate management groups, the Aboriginal Fisheries Exemption (AFE) and test fishing catches need to be removed. Subsequent information in the table illustrates the performance of the TAM rule in terms of the resulting escapement when perfectly executed and assuming the pre-season MA forecast is correct. More specifically, it calculates the number of spawners that are predicted to reach the spawning grounds while taking into account en route loss and compares these numbers against the numbers observed in the brood year (BY spawners) and on average on the cycle, both in absolute numbers as well as in percentage.\n32\n\fPre-season planning: pre-season management information\nTable 1.

Due to concerns about the potential impacts of increased variability and observed trends in productivity that accompanies climate change, DFO is currently reviewing the robustness of the current and alternative harvest control rules. This is occurring within the FRSSI model by testing the TAM rules against alternative future productivity patterns to identify TAM rules that produce undesirable outcomes. DFO is targeting the incorporation of productivity changes in the evaluation of the harvest control rules in time for the 2022 Fraser River sockeye season.\nEven though the simulation model used to derive escapement plans evaluates the impact of different TAM rules on individual stocks, the in-season implementation aims to ensure escapement targets are reached for each management group, not for each stock. Currently the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) has assessed 8 stocks as endangered (Early Stuart, Bowron, Taseko, Late Stuart, Quesnel, Portage, Weaver, Cultus) and 2 as threatened (North Barriere, Widgeon, (COSEWIC 2017).\n34\nManagement Unitp10p25p50p75p90Summerlower ref. pt. (w misc)1,064,300 1,064,300 1,064,300 1,064,300 1,064,300 (w.

Test Fishing Catch Forecasts\nE. Taylor\nTest fishing plans are developed pre-season by the Fraser River Panel with the objective to inform decisions of the Panel while minimizing negative implications for conservation and for other fisheries, i.e., minimizing the number of fish retained. Because test fishing catch are accounted for prior to allocating Total Allowable Catch (TAC, Chapter B26), they have a direct impact on potential harvest opportunities. Pre-season forecasts of test fishing catches are therefore important for planning and as inputs into the Fishery Planning Model (FPM, Chapter A6). They are also important to determine the financial outlook of test fishing operations. While test fishing catches are not limited to Fraser River sockeye salmon, the test fishing deduction to the TAC is an estimate of the total retained Fraser River sockeye catch from all Panel-approved test fisheries. This deduction is made up of two components: fish that are unavoidably killed when conducting test fishing operations or the fish required for biological samples (non- discretionary catch) and additional fish retained by the test fishery to offset test fishing costs (discretionary catch, also referred to as pay fish). Forecast of non-discretionary catches are based on test fishing catches on previous cycle line years, adjusted to account for differences in run size while discretionary catch forecasts are dependent on assumed average weight and price. Pay fish however are only retained when agreed to by the Fraser River Panel and following specific conditions as set out by the PSC Test Fishing Policy (2021).\nIntroduction The Pacific Salmon Commission (PSC), or its predecessor the International Pacific Salmon Fisheries Commission, has operated test fisheries to obtain data required to inform bilateral decisions of the Fraser River Panel since the 1960s. These test fisheries implemented under the Pacific Salmon Treaty are essential for the Fraser River Panel to fulfil its responsibilities in terms of ensuring conservation objectives are met through appropriate in-season harvest management and catch allocation. Test fishing catch refers to the number of salmon caught and retained in Panel-approved test fisheries. The test fishing catch is comprised of non-discretionary and discretionary catch. Non-discretionary catch refers to the fish that are unavoidably killed when conducting test fishing operations. This catch includes all salmon caught by gill nets and those required for biological samples. Discretionary catches refer to the retention of additional salmon by the marine purse seine or reef net test fisheries to offset the costs of the test fishing program. Discretionary catch is often referred to as Pay Fish. Guidelines for the retention of test fishing catches and pay fish are described in the PSC Test Fishing Policy (2021).\nPredicting test fishing catches is an important component of the pre-season planning process as reliable predictions of test fishing catches and associated revenue are important to plan for potential financial surplus or deficit scenarios. In addition, test fishing catch forecasts are also important to predict Total Allowable Catch (TAC) which is derived by deducting the agreed Fraser River Aboriginal Exemption and the predicted catch in Panel-authorized test fisheries from the harvestable surplus (Chapter A4). Test fishing catches are therefore also termed test fishing deductions when discussing TAC calculations (Chapter B26). Test fishing catch forecasts are generated several years ahead based on past catches on the same cycle years and are updated annually based on preseason run size estimates, generated before the start of the fishing season. In-season, these forecasts are replaced with actual catch observations.\n36\n\fPre-season planning: pre-season management information\nData Predictions of non-discretionary test fishing catches are based on historical catch data of all test fisheries combined, while weight and price information are used to predict the catch needed to cover the cost of the test fishing program.\nMethods For non-discretionary catch, a multi-year retrospective analysis indicated that there is a strong correlation between the non-discretionary catch and historical catches over the previous three cycle years. Preseason, prior to a preseason run size forecast being available, the average of the three cycle years are used to forecast test fishing catches. Once a run size forecast is available, this estimate is used to scale the test fishing catches of the historical years by dividing the total test fishing catches by the total run sizes and calculating the non-discretionary test fishing harvest rates. These historical harvest rates, used in combination with the run size forecast, allow to predict non-discretionary test fishing catches.\nWhen discretionary catch is authorized, it is normally with the intention of achieving cost-neutrality and therefore discretionary catch predictions are based on the number of salmon needed to pay for the test fishing program minus non-discretionary catches. The forecast of the discretionary catch is dependant on the assumed average weight and price of the salmon. Under certain conditions, additional discretionary salmon could be caught beyond the salmon needed to pay for the test fishing program in the current year with the aim to supplement the test fishing revolving fund and offset future test fishing costs. These conditions include extremely high salmon abundances and/or the ability of either country to harvest their full TAC (PSC 2021).\nWhen test fishing catch forecasts are used as deductions in the TAC calculations, they need to be allocated to individual management groups, i.e., Early Stuart, Early Summer, Summer and Late run. For non-discretionary catches, this is achieved by multiplying the total catch forecast with the average proportion by management group as observed on the three most recent cycle years. For discretionary catches, the management group-specific estimates are obtained by multiplying the total discretionary catch estimates with the proportions of each management group within the predicted harvestable surplus for the current year.\nPlanned Changes and Potential Areas for Improvement Overall, the use of 3-year cycle line averages to predict non-discretionary and discretionary catches has been a simple and effective method and there are no changes planned to the current estimation methodology. As run sizes have declined in recent years, there has been increased attention paid to the test fishing catches as a deduction to the harvestable surplus as it determines the available TAC to be shared by Canada and the U.S. In some years, when the distribution of test fishing catch across management groups has differed substantially from the distribution based on the run size forecast, the method has been adjusted slightly to only rely on past years with similar distributions across management groups.\nReferences Pacific Salmon Commission Test Fishing Policy.

Hague\nSummary Pre-season, the Fraser River Panel uses a fisheries simulation model developed by PSC staff, hereafter referred to as the PSC Planning Model, to develop preliminary fishing plans, to identify potential limitations in achieving management objectives, and to explore the effect of uncertain biological and management inputs on proposed fisheries. The goal of these plans is to create a fisheries schedule which meets Panel objectives under key pre-season assumptions. The PSC Planning Model is a simulation tool primarily used to assess sensitivity of fisheries plans and achievement of management targets under alternative biological (e.g. run size, diversion rate) and/or management (e.g. total allowable mortality rules) scenarios. Model results are used to guide pre-season planning for stakeholders and to inform early in-season management decisions prior to the availability of updated in-season run size information (Chapter B19). This report describes the general process used to populate, run and evaluate the PSC Planning Model. Detailed descriptions of model inputs and the technical implementation of the model structure are described in the companion Chapters A7-A9.\nIntroduction Pursuant to Article IV, Chapter 4, Paragraph 9d, of the Pacific Salmon Treaty, the Fraser River Technical Committee (FRTC) and Pacific Salmon Commission (PSC) staff work jointly to develop fisheries and management plans for Fraser River sockeye salmon prior to the start of each fishing season using the PSC Planning Model. The goal of these plans is to create a provisional fisheries schedule which meets Panel objectives (PST, Article IV, Chapter 4, paragraph 10) under key pre-season assumptions. Historically, pre-season fishing plans for Fraser River sockeye salmon were based on management experiences in previous years, but as the variability in biological forecasts and the complexity of the management regimes increased, managers realised the need for a more rigorous and structured planning tool (Cave and Gazey 1994). The first version of the PSC Planning Model was created by Rod Cooke and Jim Cave (IPSFC, predecessor of the PSC) in 1984, and was used extensively beginning in 1985 (final year of the IPSFC) (J. Cave, personal communication). These models were developed in early spreadsheet software and were restricted in size and complexity due to the computer processing limitations of the day. Early run reconstruction models (Starr and Hilborn 1988) influenced later updates to the Planning Model structure and harvest rate parameterisation (Cave and Gazey 1994) and the model was re-coded in Excel in 1997 (J. Cave, personal communication).\nOver time, the model has been adapted and updated to reflect changes to fishery structure and to address requests from the FRP and FRTC. Some of these changes include controls for individual transferable quota (ITQ) fisheries in Canada, separate accounting for Fisheries Induced Mortalities (FIMs), tracking of both discretionary (i.e. pay fish) and non-discretionary test fishing catch, changes in assignment of stocks to management groups, Management Adjustment (MA) deductions, inclusion of Low Abundance Exploitation Rates (LAERs), changes to the relevance of different fisheries and refinements to underlying biological assumptions. While the spreadsheet model continued to meet most pre-season management objectives, the structural framework restricted flexibility and was prone to errors during the revision process.\n38\n\fPre-season Planning: Assessment of Fisheries Plans\nIn 2011, the FRTC and FRP agreed to restructure the PSC Planning Model in R statistical software (R Core Team 2013) which could handle the increased complexity required to explicitly model many of the model assumptions. Over the next several years, PSC staff worked with Panel and Technical Committee members to develop the current Planning Model which is controlled by a Graphical User Interface (GUI) developed using the RShiny package (Shiny (rstudio.com)). The R model has improved the transparency of underlying model assumptions and has increased the flexibility and ease with which the modellers can make changes to fisheries and stock structure.\nData The PSC Planning Model relies on three different types of data inputs: biological, fisheries, and management. A more thorough description of the key inputs in the Planning Model is provided in Chapter A7, but they are also briefly described here. The biological inputs define the abundance of the expected salmon return, i.e. the run size forecast, and how these salmon are distributed in space and time. The latter is defined by the timing of the run, the number of days it takes for 95% of the run to migrate through an area (i.e., the spread), the proportion of the total run migrating through Johnstone Strait (i.e. the diversion rate), the proportion of the run that delays their upstream migration into the Fraser River and the number of days of delay. Within the Planning Model, stocks are grouped for modelling purposes based on similarities in migratory patterns (12 modelling groups) but are aggregated by management group (Early Stuart, Early Summer, Summer, Late-run, and Fraser pinks) for reporting and evaluation purposes.\nThe fisheries inputs relate to the anticipated amount of fishing effort or resulting catch, how that effort or catch will be distributed across the salmon season and if catches will be retained or released. In the case of test fishing catches, fisheries input also includes predicted non-discretionary catches as well as discretionary catches and the schedule when these discretionary catches will be taken to pay for the test fishing program, i.e. taken as pay fish (Chapter A5).\nThe management inputs differ by management group and are defined by the various components of the Spawning Escapement Plan (Chapter A4): the Spawning Escapement Target (SET), the Management Adjustment (MA) (Chapter A3), the Test Fishing Deduction (Chapter A5), the Aboriginal Fisheries Exemption (AFE) and the Low Abundance Exploitation Rate (LAER). In addition, the PSC Planning Model also requires inputs regarding the allocation of the Total Allowable Catch (TAC, Chapter B26) across the various fisheries, both internationally as well as nationally.\nModel inputs are either based on medians derived from historical time series, generated by forecast models run outside of the Planning Model structure, or based on the expert judgment from within the FRTC and FRP. Because several forecast models to produce biological inputs require covariate data and these are only available immediately prior to the season, Planning Model inputs in early spring rely primarily on medians derived from historical time series (Chapter A7). Depending on the source of the data, inputs are either updated annually, multiple times annually, or as additional information becomes available. There are two key parameterisation timeframes: the first occurs in the early spring when most inputs are typically calculated from historical timeseries, and the second occurs in late spring once more covariates for forecast models become available. The updating of management and fisheries inputs typically follows the same schedule as for the biological parameters of the model. February inputs are based on historical observations, run size forecasts, and preliminary escapement plans and are typically finalised during the June meeting once the Canadian Minister of Fisheries has approved Canada’s annual Integrated Fisheries Management Plan (IFMP, DFO 2018).\nUnder the Pacific Salmon Treaty (Article IV, Chapter 4, Paragraphs 3 and 4), Canada is responsible for producing run-size specific estimates of SETs, LAERs, and AFEs. In addition, the technical chairs provide\n39\n\fPre-season Planning: Assessment of Fisheries Plans\ninformation relating to anticipated fishing effort levels, fishing schedules for their respective countries, and domestic catch allocations for their respective countries. Secretariat staff provide advice on preseason estimates of management adjustments, although final adoption is left to the discretion of the Panel (Chapter A3), as well as test fishery deductions and the test fishing schedule (Chapter A5). More detailed descriptions of the PSC Planning Model inputs, including responsibilities, is provided in Chapter A7.\nModel The PSC Planning Model assumes a daily time step with salmon moving in groups (box-cars) through a series of gauntlet-style mixed gear and mixed stock fisheries (Cave and Gazey 1996). Spatially, the model covers fishing areas in both Johnstone Strait and Juan de Fuca Strait, starting with DFO statistical Areas 12 and 20 and extending into the upper mainstem of the Fraser River, DFO statistical Area 29. Daily abundances in the most seaward areas are defined by the stock group specific forecast estimates of run size, timing and spread in addition to the diversion rate. Daily “blocks” of salmon are then moved through the different fishing areas and exposed to a sequential series of fisheries (Figures 1 and 2 in Chapter A8). The different fisheries are modelled through the application of harvest rates equations. The abundance of fish exposed to a given fishery is controlled by underlying specifications of migration rate and the length of a fishing area. For example, fish that migrate through an area over the course of several days may also be exposed to multiple days of fishing. Alternatively, this means that more than one daily migratory block of fish would be exposed to a single fishery opening in a large fishing area, or in an area in which fish are assumed to delay or slow down their migration.\nUsing the PSC Planning Model, the FRTC annually explores alternative fishery scenarios to optimise the achievement of Pacific Salmon Treaty objectives (achievement of SETs and international as well as domestic catch allocations) under various biological and/or management assumptions. This is done during the bilateral FRTC meetings in April and June. User-inputs allow FRTC chairs to evaluate different fishing schedules and assumed different harvest efficiencies to optimise outputs and balance conservation, fishery, and domestic objectives. Biological and/or management inputs are varied across scenarios to assess the sensitivity of fishing plans to changes in underlying assumptions. PSC staff provide the necessary modelling and administrative support when running the PSC Planning Model prior to presenting results to the Fraser River Panel for further discussion.\nThe current PSC Planning Model runs on a joint MS Excel and R (R Core Team 2013) operating platform. Excel interfaces are used for entering baseline data inputs and summarising key model outputs. The main simulation framework is coded in the statistical software R and controlled by users through an RShiny GUI.\nResults The PSC Planning Model summarises the results of the models in a series of tables collating fishery- specific and management related statistics (e.g. Tables 1 and 2). The FRTC chairs use these outputs to refine preseason fishing plans and to communicate results of final model runs to the Fraser River Panel. At the end of the June meeting, a Panel-approved “Base Case” model is adopted which can be referenced in-season to help guide decision making for early fisheries. The alternative model runs allow FRP and FRTC members to evaluate the sensitivity of that base case plans to different assumptions. Model results are communicated at various levels of resolution so that fishing plans can be evaluated in terms of meeting international (e.g. escapement targets and TAC) as well as domestic (e.g. appropriate allocation of or distribution of fishery opportunities) objectives. In addition, model results may be used during the domestic consultation process to help communicate anticipated fishery plans.\n40\n\fPre-season Planning: Assessment of Fisheries Plans\nTable 1.

Hague\nSummary The PSC Planning Model (Chapter A6) is a simulation tool used by the Fraser River Panel to assess the sensitivity of fisheries plans and achievement of management targets to alternative biological (e.g. run size, diversion rate) and/or management scenarios. This report describes the key biological, management and fisheries inputs used to parameterise the PSC Planning Model and run simulations. Further details regarding model parameterisation and underlying assumptions can be found in Chapter A8 and A9.\nIntroduction Pre-season, the Fraser River Panel (FRP) and Fraser River Technical Committee (FRTC) use the PSC Planning Model to develop preliminary fishing plans, to identify potential limitations to achievement of management objectives, and to explore the effect of uncertain biological and management inputs on proposed fisheries. This simulation model requires a wide range of different inputs: biological inputs to model the behaviour of the different stocks, fisheries inputs to assess the impact of various fisheries on the stocks and management inputs to ensure management objectives are met. Early in the year, these inputs are based on historical data and preliminary schedules and plans, while just prior to the start of the season, the model inputs are replaced with improved forecasts and federally approved escapement plans. Model seeding, or parameterisation, occurs twice per year: once in February/April and a second time in June. The responsibility for providing different model inputs falls primarily onto Canada and the PSC, with the U.S. providing additional domestic-level information regarding their own fisheries as well as domestic targets and constraints. Typically, the Panel will approve the parameterisation of a “base case” model before the conclusion of their final pre-season meeting in June based on the best-available information.\nData\nBIOLOGICAL INPUTS\nThe PSC Planning Model simulates the daily migration of 12 different Fraser River sockeye salmon stock groups, in addition to a single group for all Fraser River pink salmon. Table 1 provides a list of the different sockeye salmon stock groupings used in the Planning Model. Table 1 provides a guide for aggregating stock-specific information from historical reconstruction and pre-season forecast files into appropriate groupings currently utilised pre-season. These groups are structured to aggregate groups of fish with identical management constraints and migratory parameters (Chapter A6). Table 2 provides a description of the key biological inputs in the PSC Planning Model. Pre-season estimates of run size, timing, spread and diversion are used to parameterise normal distributions of daily abundance entering Johnstone Strait and Juan de Fuca Strait while delay information is used to model the upstream migration timing of various stocks which hold in the Strait of Georgia prior to moving up-river.\n44\n\fPre-season Planning: Assessment of Fisheries Plans\nTable 1.

Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) provides pre-season forecasts of sockeye salmon run size using a suite of stock recruitment and naïve models (Grant et al. 2010, Chapter A1). These forecasts are provided at a finer stock resolution than used by the PSC Planning Model, and so must be aggregated to the model group level (Table 1). The uncertainty around the run size forecast is expressed in terms of a probability distribution. As stated in the PST (Chapter 4), the median forecast (p50) is used as the default input for the base case planning scenario, but the Panel may also choose to adopt a more precautionary or optimistic forecast until the in-season run size estimates are available. A key sensitivity analysis performed by the parties during pre-season fisheries planning is to vary the assumed run size from the default median (p50) estimate to either a lower (e.g., p25), or higher (e.g., p75) estimate of abundance. Preseason run size estimates are typically available in February and do not get updated until during the season.\nMarine timing In the PSC Planning Model, marine timing is termed as the Area 20 50% date, or the date by which 50% of a run has passed the mid-point of statistical Area 20 assuming all sockeye salmon migrate through the southern approach around Vancouver Island (Chapter A2). Both the absolute timing as well as the offsets between the timings of the various management groups (Early Stuart, Early Summer, Summer and Late run) influence preseason fishing plans. During the spring, timings for the different stock groups in the PSC Planning Model are calculated based on historical timing data derived from post-season reconstructed daily marine abundance estimates (Chapter B18). Statistical and retrospective analyses are used to determine the best available estimates for each stock in a given year. Typically, all-year medians, cycle-line medians or all-year medians excluding 2016 cycle line data are used.\nIn June, DFO provides additional timing forecasts for Early Stuart and Chilko based on oceanographic models (Folkes et al. 2018, Chapter A2). These estimates are applied directly to update the Early Stuart and Chilko timing estimates. For all other stock groups, the historical timing is updated either earlier or later depending on the difference between the Chilko timing forecast to the Chilko historically-based timing estimate. This approach assumes the underlying oceanographic conditions affecting Chilko salmon will have the same effect on other co-migrating stocks. It is at the Fraser River Panel’s discretion to utilise these updated timing forecasts, to use the historical timing estimates, or to adopt some alternative value.\nSpread Another parameter used to define the anticipated daily abundances of fish is the spread of the run. Assuming the run follows a normal distribution, the spread indicates the number of days for 95% of the run to migrate past a reference location (i.e., the standard deviation of the normal distribution). Annual spreads are calculated from reconstructed historical marine timing profiles (Chapter B18) and are quantified using the same subset of years selected for the historical timing estimates. Spread estimates for aggregated stocks are calculated by first summing daily reconstructed abundances and then re- calculating the spread of the group. The spread model inputs are only updated once a year, during the initial model seeding process.\nNorthern diversion rate The diversion rate is defined as the proportion of the run that migrates through Johnstone Strait, i.e., the northern approach. The models to predict the diversion rate have varied over time and will likely continue to evolve. In 2018, a new process of predicting the diversion rate in March was applied\n46\n\fPre-season Planning: Assessment of Fisheries Plans\nwhereby the daily diversion rates over the last three years on the cycle line were averaged. In June, DFO provides an additional annual forecast of the total Fraser River sockeye salmon diversion rate using a suite of oceanographic models (Folkes et al. 2018, Chapter A2). The pattern of daily diversion based on the historical data is then multiplied by a scaler to ensure the total diversion was equivalent to the DFO forecast. The daily diversion rate estimates are multiplied by the daily abundances of the various stock groups to calculate the abundances migrating through Johnstone Strait versus Juan de Fuca Strait. Unlike other Fraser River sockeye salmon stocks, Harrison sockeye migrate predominantly through the south. Given the limited amount of historical data, a Harrison-specific diversion rate is derived by adjusting the diversion rate based on the historical relationship between total Fraser and Harrison-only diversion rates.\nDelay in upstream migration A percentage of Harrison (Summer run) and Late-run stocks (excluding Birkenhead and Big Silver) typically delay their migration in the Strait of Georgia for a variable number of days prior to continuing their upriver migration (Cooke et al. 2004). Historically, the number of days delay and the upstream timing has differed across cycle lines and except for odd cycle line years, cycle line medians are used as model input. The proportion of the run that delay their upstream migration, the Mission 50% migration date of both the delaying and non-delaying components, and the spread of the delay component are all inputs into the PSC Planning Model. Using expert judgement, these inputs are adjusted to produce results consistent with the historical median estimates of delay and the median 50% migration date at Mission.\nMANAGEMENT INPUTS\nMost of the bi-lateral management parameters are provided by Canada, pursuant to guidance in the Pacific Salmon Treaty (Article IV, Chapter 4). In addition, PSC staff provide test fishing deductions (Chapter A5) and management adjustments (Chapter A3); both of which also influence the calculation of Total Allowable Catch (TAC). Preliminary escapement plans from Canada are generally aligned with rules corresponding to either the previous year, or previous year on the cycle line. Updated values are normally available by June, but Ministerial approval may be delayed until early in the fishing season.\nTAMs, SETs, AFEs, and LAERs Under the Pacific Salmon Treaty (Chapter 4, Article IV), Canada is responsible for providing harvest control rules for the management of Fraser River sockeye stocks. Prior to each fishing season, the Minister of Fisheries, Oceans and the Canadian Coast Guard must formally approve an annual Integrated Fisheries Management Plan (IFMP) following a series of consultations with key stakeholder groups. This plan includes harvest control rules that define the Spawning Escapement Targets (SET), Total Allowable Mortality (TAM), and Low Abundance Exploitation rates (LAERs) for each sockeye salmon management group (DFO 2018, Chapter A4). Fraser River sockeye salmon follow abundance-based harvest rules and so the SET and TAM values vary as a function of the assumed run size. The Aboriginal Fisheries Exemption, or AFE, is also described in the IFMP provided by Canada. This is a fixed 400,000 sockeye deduction from the bi-lateral Total Allowable Catch (TAC) to meet Canadian First Nations fishing requirements.\nManagement Adjustments Management Adjustments (MAs) represent the expected number of additional fish required to pass the Mission hydroacoustic facility to achieve the desired SET. Initial preseason MAs are based on historical discrepancies, or differences between escapements at Mission and those on the spawning grounds (DBEs), after accounting for known catch removals from historical data sets. Historical discrepancies (Chapter A3, B22) may exist because of errors in stock assessment, catch accounting, or natural en route\n47\n\fPre-season Planning: Assessment of Fisheries Plans\nlosses. In June, long range environmental forecasts (Chapter B23) produced by the DFO Environmental Watch Program are used to predict MAs for Early Stuart, Early Summer run and Summer run using multiple regression models fit to time series of lower river discharge and temperature data (Macdonald et al. 2010, Cummings et al. 2011). The Late-run MA is either left as the historical median or updated to a predicted MA estimate based on estimated upstream timing (Macdonald et al. 2010, Cummings et al. 2011). However, the Panel may choose alternative MAs for any of the management groups.\nTable 3. A description of the key management inputs in the PSC Fisheries Planning model.\nTest fishery deductions Pursuant to the PST (Article 4, Chapter 4), the TAC is reduced by the amount of catch in Panel authorised test fisheries. Test fishing catches consist of nondiscretionary catch of fish that are unavoidably killed when conducting test fishing operations and discretionary catches retained to offset test fishing costs. Preseason, the Panel agrees to a draft test fishing plan put forth by PSC staff. A detailed description of how test fishery deductions are predicted for pre-season planning is provided in Chapter A5. Estimated catches by fishery are calculated from historical catchability estimates applied to simulated daily fish abundances. Gill net test fisheries are assumed to retain all fish, whereas purse seine fisheries are modelled as either non-retention (fish are only landed to meet scientific sampling requirements) vs. retention (all fish are landed and fish in excess of the sampling requirements are used to offset the cost of the test fishing program).\nThe distribution of test fishing catches across management groups is calculated using a combination of two approaches. First, the non-discretionary catch (i.e., all gill net test fishery catch plus scientific samples in the purse seine test fishery) is proportionally assigned to each group based on the historical distribution of non-discretionary catches average over the last 3 cycle lines and adjusted for the current proposed test fishery dates. Second, the discretionary catch (i.e., fish landed above and beyond those required for scientific samples), is proportionally distributed as a function of the available harvestable surplus for each management group (i.e., run size minus spawning escapement target and management\n48\nInputDescriptionRelevant ChapterUpdate scheduleSourceResponsible PartyMarchPrevious cycle yearPSC staffJuneIFMPCanadaMarchPrevious cycle yearPSC staffJuneIFMPCanadaMarchPrevious cycle yearPSC staffJuneIFMPCanadaMarchPrevious cycle yearPSC staffJuneIFMPCanadaMarchHistorical mediansPSC staffJuneMA modelsPSC staffTest Fishery DeductionAnticipated test fishing catches by management groupA5MarchHistorical cycle line dataPSC staffLow abundance exploitation rates (LAERs)By-catch limit for management groups without harvestable surplus during fisheries directed at more abundant co-migrating groupsManagement Adjustments (MA)Numerical MA deductions by management groupA4A4A4A4A3Total Allowable Mortality (TAM) rulesManagement group specific rules to define the total allowable mortality at different run sizeSpawning Escapement Targets (SETs) Run size specific SET for each of the management groupsAboriginal Fisheries Exemptions (AFEs)Run size specific AFEs for each of the management groups\n\fPre-season Planning: Assessment of Fisheries Plans\nadjustment). These approaches are sometimes revised to meet the expected stock composition and/or test fishery schedule assumed for a given year.\nInternational and domestic allocations The PST (Article 4, Chapter 4) assigns 16.5% of the TAC available for international sharing to the U.S. with the balance assigned to Canada. In addition, each country allocates their respective share across different stake-holder groups following pre-season consultations. These percentages are then used as objectives to help guide the fishing plans in the PSC Planning Model. Canada assigns allocations to different commercial fishing sectors: Area B seine, Area D gill net, Area E gill net, Area H troll, and Area G troll. Allocation targets are also specified for marine, lower river, and interior First Nations fisheries as well as marine and in-river recreational fisheries. In the US, allocation percentages are used to divide the TAC between Tribal and All Citizen fisheries.\nFISHERIES INPUTS\nFisheries inputs relate to the number of vessels expected to participate to a fishery, i.e., the fishing effort, or expected catches and the schedule when fishing is expected to occur. Table 4 provides a description of the key fisheries inputs in the PSC Planning Model.\nTable 4. A description of the key fisheries inputs in the PSC Fisheries Planning model.\nFishing effort Effort-based harvest rate equations are used in the PSC Planning Model to generate estimates of catch for derby-style fisheries. The model is seeded with historical estimates of fishing effort (total number of vessels) for the following fisheries: marine gillnet (Area 11, Area 12), marine purse seine (Area 12, Area 13 and Area 20), troll (Area 29), Tribal (Area 4B56C, Area 7, Area 7A), and All Citizen (Area 7, Area 7A).\nFixed catch (for fisheries not modelled dynamically) Some fisheries are not dynamically modelled within the PSC Planning Model, either because of unparameterized harvest equations, or because they are outside of the current geographic scope. Instead, experts provide estimates of catch by management group, including estimates of fishing induced sockeye mortalities (FIMs) in pink salmon directed fisheries. The Canadian FRTC chair provides catch estimates for the following fisheries: marine recreational catch, in-river beach seine FIMs, and gulf seine FIMs. PSC staff will provide catches estimates for the purse seine test fishing samples. These catches are relatively small and are estimated based on daily sample sizes and distributed across management groups based on historical stock composition information.\nFishing plans Once the model has been fully parameterised under a given set of assumptions, the FRTC works with PSC Staff to develop a fishing plan for each country. The goal of these plans is to optimise trade-offs\n49\n\fPre-season Planning: Assessment of Fisheries Plans\nbetween conservation and fishing objectives by developing fishing scenarios that meet Spawning Escapement Targets, come as close as possible to meeting the international TAC allocations as well as domestic allocation requirements. Model input requirements vary by fishery depending on the underlying equations. At a minimum, derby-style fisheries must include a start and end date, while ITQ- style fisheries (Individual Transferable Quota) must also indicate an anticipated target catch. Users can choose to specify the hours of fishing operations, the fishing effort and if sockeye catches would be retained or not. Initial fishing plans developed in March/April are updated and finalised following an update of the model inputs in June.\nReferences Cummings, J.W., Hague, M.J., Patterson, D.A., and Peterman, R.M. 2011.

Hague\nSummary The PSC Planning Model (Chapter A6) is a simulation tool used by the Fraser River Panel to assess different alternative fisheries plans and their ability to achieve management targets under various biological (e.g., run size, diversion rate) and/or management scenarios. The calculations of catch and escapement by the Planning Model (Chapter A9) rely fundamentally on assumptions associated with forward run reconstructions. This report describes the key assumptions regarding the dynamics of fish movement and migration behaviour. The sources and processes underlying the annual re-parameterisation of the biological and fisheries management inputs feeding into the model are provided in Chapter A7.\nIntroduction As described in Chapter A6, and pursuant to Article IV, Chapter 4, Paragraph 9d, of the Pacific Salmon Treaty, the Fraser River Technical Committee (FRTC) and Pacific Salmon Commission (PSC) staff work jointly to develop fisheries management plans for Fraser River sockeye salmon prior to the start of each fishing season using the PSC Planning Model. The usefulness of the Planning Model as a management tool depends in part on the accuracy of biological pre-season forecasts, but also on the realism of the underlying model parameterisations, primarily those relating to fish movement and vulnerability to fishery operations.\nFundamentally, the Planning Model is a forward reconstruction model (Cave and Gazey 1996, Starr and Hilborn 1998), simulating the daily migrations of sockeye salmon as they “move” through a gauntlet of marine and freshwater fisheries. The model uses fishery-specific instantaneous mortality rates applied to vulnerable “blocks” of salmon to estimate fisheries-specific catches and escapement (Chapter A9). Since the original publication of the forward reconstruction model by Cave and Gazey (1996), the assumptions underlying the model have been changed to reflect both improved information about stock-specific differences in salmon migratory behaviour, and changes to fisheries and management strategies (Chapter A9). Biologically, a larger number of individual stock groups are modelled given the availability of more detailed stock-specific data since the advancement of DNA-based stock identification technology. Increased understanding of stock-specific fish migration behaviour has also resulted in changes to modelling approaches for diversion rate (percentage of fish migrating via Johnstone Strait vs. Juan de Fuca Strait) and delay in the Strait of Georgia. The following report describes the main biological assumptions underlying the simulation model.\nReconstruction Model Assumptions\nNORMAL RUN TIMING DISTRIBUTIONS\nWithin the PSC Planning Model, ‘stocks’ are defined as aggregates of fish with a unique set of migration characteristics such as: migratory path, migration rates, delay behaviour, marine arrival timing, and abundance. These stock groups are based on the four different Fraser River management groups but with additional sub-groups based on migration differentiation. For example, Late-run fish are divided into additional groups depending on whether they migrate through Johnstone Strait (North) or through Juan de Fuca Strait (South), whether or not they delay their upstream migration, and whether they\n51\n\fPre-season Planning: Assessment of Fisheries Plans\nspawn below or above the confluence of the Harrison River. The full suite of Planning Model stock groups and migration parameters are described in Chapter A7 (Tables 1 and 2). The biological model for each stock (s) is initialised by creating a series of normally distributed daily migration profiles centred on an index of expected median marine migration timing:\n\n𝑁(𝑑) = 𝑁 ∙\n\n2\n1 2\n∙(\n𝑑−𝜇 𝜎\n)\n∙ 𝑒−\n1\n𝜎√2𝜋\nwhere N is the total forecasted abundance (run size) of a stock, d is day, σ is the standard deviation, and μ is the median marine migration date of the run (Figure 1). The marine migration date, also referred to as the Area 20 date or marine 50% date, indicates the date when half (50%) of the run would have passed through Area 20 assuming all fish migrated via that route. The normal distributions are parameterised using pre-season forecasts of abundance, timing and standard deviation (see Chapter A7).\nNext, a daily diversion rate pattern (i.e. proportion of the run migrating around the northern tip of Vancouver Island instead of through Juan de Fuca Strait) is applied to create separate entry distributions for the northern and southern approaches around Vancouver Island (Figure 1). Alternative diversion rate patterns can be applied to individual stocks to accommodate known differences in migratory routes. Fish migrating through the southern approach are initiated in Area 127 off the southwest coast of Vancouver Island, and fish migrating through the northern approach are initiated in Area 111 off the northern tip of the island (Figure 1).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. (a) Schematic illustrating the fisheries “gauntlet” modelled by the PSC fisheries planning model. (b) A GIS map of corresponding locations.\nBOX-CAR FORWARD RECONSTRUCTION ASSUMPTIONS\nOnce the daily abundance estimates, representing Fraser River sockeye expected to migrate through the north and south, are derived, the model uses a set of control rules to move fish through space and time\n52\n\fPre-season Planning: Assessment of Fisheries Plans\nfrom the tip of Vancouver Island to the Mission hydroacoustic site, and then continuing up the mainstem. Terminal fisheries harvests or catch excess to spawning escapement requirements (ESSRs) are not specifically addressed within the current modelling construct.\nThe forward reconstruction assumes a ‘boxcar’ style movement of fish occurring on a daily time-step (Cave and Gazey 1996, Starr and Hilborn 1998) over most of the migration. A ‘bathtub’ assumption is also applied, meaning that on a given day fish are either fully vulnerable to, or completely unaffected by, an assumed fishery opening. Migration times, and thus the exposure of a given daily migration ‘block’ of fish to a given fishery, are controlled by underlying stock-specific migration rates and lengths of each fishing area (Appendix A, Table A1). It is assumed that fish remain in a statistical area for a minimum of one day and migration times are rounded to full daily increments. Statistical areas associated with residency times greater than one day are represented by multiple model sub-areas, each representing roughly one day of migration time in the model (Appendix A, Table A1). In some cases, statistical areas represent parallel migration routes (e.g., Area 20, Areas 4B, 5, 6, and 6C) and for migration purposes they are considered identical but are still identified uniquely for the purposes of catch accounting (i.e., fish are assumed to migrate simultaneously through Canadian Area 20 and US Area 4B56C).\nFigure 2 illustrates how the boxcar movement assumptions interact with fishery exposure during the forward reconstruction. Exposure times depend on the dates of the fishery opening, the migration rate of the fish, and the size of the fishing area. In some cases, the same group of fish could be exposed to fishing pressure across multiple days of a fishery opening, while in others, a group of fish may only be vulnerable to a fishery for part of an opening.\nFigure 2. Schematic illustration of a basic boxcar run reconstruction model. The colored bars represent different statistical fishing areas, with the left most square representing the most seaward location. Each “fish/hook” represents one day of fishing. Each fish represents one daily block of fish. Black fish in each panel are not exposed to a fishery opening on a given day, while grey fish are. Each panel represents a daily time-step. The top panel represents the shape of the unfished run prior to entering marine approach fisheries. The bottom panel represents the shape of the run at Mission, with certain days of abundance reduced due to catch removals.\n53\n\fPre-season Planning: Assessment of Fisheries Plans\nFollowing the illustration in Figure 2, the escapement of fish (N) into area (a) on a given day (d) is reduced by an amount equivalent to the landed catches and fishing induced mortalities (FIMs) occurring on that day in that area. Assuming it takes one day for the fish to migrate through area a, the resulting escapement of fish into the downstream area (a+1) on the next day (d+1) is represented by:\n\n𝑁𝑎+1(𝑑 + 1) = 𝑁𝑎(𝑑) − 𝐶𝑎(𝑑)\n\nThe resulting daily escapement into the Fraser River (NFR), after migrating for m days through all areas along the migration route and being intercepted by k fisheries along the way, is given by:\n\n𝑁𝐹𝑅(𝑑 + 𝑚) = 𝑁(𝑑) − ∑\n\n𝑘 𝑓=1 𝐶𝑓\nSTRAIT OF GEORGIA MIGRATION DELAY BEHAVIOUR\nThe exception to boxcar movement occurs in the Strait of Georgia near the Fraser River Delta, where a proportion of the Late-run and Harrison stocks delay their migration prior to moving upstream (Lapointe et al. 2003). Delaying fish are assumed to both slow down, and to redistribute when entering the Fraser River, thus violating the assumptions of a boxcar model. Subsequent to river entry, boxcar movement is assumed to resume for the remainder of the freshwater migration. A separate sub-model is applied to model stocks which hold and redistribute in the Strait of Georgia (Table 1, see also Chapter A7), for which a set of parameters that characterise the period of delay, and the new profile of upstream migration, are defined. Note that this sub-model does not apply to Late run or Harrison sockeye that do not delay their upstream migration\nTo mimic delay behaviour of delaying Late run and Harrison sockeye, the model adjusts the number of fish remaining in the Strait of Georgia (NSoG) and the number of fish migrating into the lower river on a daily basis. This is done by assuming that delaying salmon fish accumulate over time in the Strait of Georgia, with a proportion of the available abundance migrating upstream:\n\n𝑁𝐹𝑅(𝑑) = 𝑝(𝑑) ∙ 𝑁𝑇,𝑆𝑜𝐺(𝑑),\n\nwhere p(d) indicates the proportion of the abundance holding in the Strait of Georgia migrating into the Fraser River (FR), and NT,SoG indicates the total accumulated abundance remaining in the Strait of Georgia, following fisheries removals. The daily proportion of available fish migrating upstream is derived from a normal density function representing the run timing profile of a delaying stock as it exits the Strait of Georgia and enters the Fraser River, where σ is the standard deviation, and μ is the upstream timing:\n\n\n\n𝑓(𝑑) =\n1 2\n∙(\n𝑑−𝜇 𝜎\n∙ 𝑒−\n2 ) .\n1\n𝜎√2𝜋\nThe proportion of delaying fish associated with each day of migration (p(d)) is then given by dividing the proportion of fish migrating upstream by the proportion of fish still present in the Strait of Georgia:\n\n\n\n𝑝(𝑑) =\n𝑓(𝑑) 𝐷 ∑ 𝑓(𝑑) 𝑑\n.\nBecause sockeye are assumed to accumulate in the Strait of Georgia, the daily abundance of out- migrating delay fish cannot simply be removed by subtracting from a single day of resident abundance (i.e. cannot be treated the same as a daily catch removal). Instead, the model makes the simplifying\n54\n\fPre-season Planning: Assessment of Fisheries Plans\nassumption that the total reduction in fish due to outmigration is spread proportionally across the remaining abundance in the Strait:\n\n\n\n𝑝𝑆𝑜𝐺(𝑑) =\n𝑁𝑆𝑜𝐺(𝑑) 𝐷 ∑ 𝑁𝑆𝑜𝐺(𝑑) 𝑑\n, with 𝑁𝑆𝑜𝐺(𝑑) = 𝑁𝑆𝑜𝐺(𝑑 − 1) − 𝐶𝑆𝑜𝐺(𝑑 − 1).\nThe result of this assumption is that the daily stock composition of sockeye entering the river from the Strait of Georgia will not mirror the daily stock composition entering the Strait of Georgia.\nThe shape of the remaining distribution fish in the Strait of Georgia after each day of upstream migration (NFR) and catch (CSoG) is then calculated using:\n\n𝑁𝑆𝑜𝐺(𝑑 + 1) = 𝑁𝑆𝑜𝐺(𝑑) − 𝑝𝑎(𝑑) ∙ 𝑁𝐹𝑅(𝑑).\n\nIn the next loop of the simulation, the escapement into the river is equivalent to the abundance out- migrating from the Strait (NFR) and the escapement into the Strait (NSOG) becomes re-defined by Equation 8. Due to the iterative nature of this calculation, daily escapement into the river is populated one day at a time, even in the absence of any fisheries.\nPlanned Changes and Potential Areas for Improvement The fisheries planning model and marine reconstruction model used to occur within the same framework and had a shared set of underlying assumptions. In recent years, some of the basic biological assumptions (e.g., movement rate) have diverged, and should be reconciled. There has been some interest in improving the modelling of pink salmon fisheries as well as upriver fisheries, some of which are currently entered as fixed inputs in the model. Modellers also continue to revise and improve the coding efficiency and user interfaces and address ongoing requests from the Fraser River Panel and Technical Committee.\nReferences Branch, T.A., and Hilborn, R. 2010.

Harvest Rate Parameterisation and Catch Dynamics\nM.J. Hague\nSummary The PSC Planning Model (Chapter A6) is a simulation tool used by the Fraser River Panel to assess alternative fisheries plans and their ability to achieve management targets under various biological (e.g., run size, diversion rate) and/or management scenarios. This report describes the fisheries included in the model as well as the different approaches for calculating catch and escapement based on daily estimates of sockeye abundance in the various fishing areas. The underlying migration assumptions are described in Chapter A8. The sources and processes used to derive the biological and fisheries management inputs to parameterise the model are provided in Chapter A7.\nIntroduction As described in Chapter A6, and pursuant to Article IV, Chapter 4, Paragraph 9d, of the Pacific Salmon Treaty, the Fraser River Technical Committee (FRTC) and Pacific Salmon Commission (PSC) staff work jointly to develop fisheries and management plans for Fraser River sockeye salmon prior to the start of each fishing season using the PSC Planning Model. The usefulness of the Planning Model as a management tool depends in part on the accuracy of pre-season biological forecasts, but also on the realism of the underlying model parameterisations, such as assumed harvest rate dynamics and the vulnerability of migrating salmon to fisheries openings.\nThe types of fisheries targeting Fraser River sockeye salmon, and the management rules used to guide them, have changed substantially since the Planning Model was first described by Cave and Gazey (1996). For example, many Canadian commercial fisheries in marine areas have changed from high intensity “derby” style fisheries, to protracted, lower-impact, individual transferable quota (ITQ) fisheries. In addition, the Planning Model now monitors the impact of both landed catch and fishing induced mortalities (FIMs) on estimated escapements; a relatively new concern due to increased interest in Fraser River pink salmon directed fisheries and the need for accurate accounting of exploitation rates associated with vulnerable Fraser River sockeye salmon stocks.\nDaily fishery catches within the Planning Model are both a function of the abundance and vulnerability of the salmon exposed to a given opening as well as a function of the assumed harvest rates of the fishery, or fisheries, operating in a given area on a given day. The following report describes the assumptions, parameterisations, and control rules used to quantify both the abundance of the vulnerable fish population and the fishery-induced mortality rates associated with individual fisheries. Resulting daily catch and escapement calculations are also defined as well as areas for future refinement.\nPlanning Model Catch Assumptions\nFISHERY HARVEST RATE DEFINITIONS\nA detailed description of fishery parameterisations within the Planning Model can be found in Table A1. There are four categories of fisheries within the model that are characterised by different harvest rate\n57\n\fPre-season Planning: Assessment of Fisheries Plans\nequations and associated parameter requirements: derby fisheries, mixed gear fisheries, ITQ fisheries, and test fisheries. Each category is described in more detail below.\nDerby Fisheries Harvest rate equations for many of the derby fisheries were parameterised with data from the 1980’s and 1990’s (Cave and Gazey 1996); Table A1. Catch is a function of the number of vessels, the assumed harvest rate per vessel, and the length of the opening. Historically, these fisheries were characterised by a short fishing window, high fishing effort (E, number of vessels participating to the fishery), and often intensive fishery exploitation. As a result, original harvest rate parameterisations were sometimes characterised for 12-hour openings, in which case the ‘elemental’ harvest rates (u) defined by Cave and Gazey (1996) were first re-scaled to daily harvest rates (h):\n\n\n\nℎ = 2 ∙ 𝑢 + 𝑢2, with 𝑢 = 𝑎 + 𝑏 ∙ 𝐸\nwhere ‘a’ and ‘b’ are fishery-specific parameters (Table A1) relating effort to harvest rate. In other cases (Table 1), daily harvest rates were parameterised as a function of effort and fishery catchability (q) estimated from historical reconstructions:\n\n\n\nℎ = 1 − 𝑒−𝑞𝐸\nMany of the FSC fisheries are modelled with a single daily harvest rate (h), which is informed by the expert judgement of fishery managers and may change at the discretion of the Canadian Technical Committee Chair. Often, the intention of these harvest rates is not to accurately reconstruct catches, but to seed the Planning Model with reasonable harvest expectations and to meet domestic catch constraints.\nU.S. Mixed Gear Fisheries The current harvest rate equations applied to US All Citizen and Tribal fisheries operating in statistical Areas 6, 7, and 7A were originally parameterised based on analyses performed in the 1980s (PSC 1990). The effort (E; quantified as number of vessels or number of landings) in these mixed gear fisheries is quantified in terms of “purse seine equivalents”. A fixed gill net to purse seine catch-per-unit-effort CPUE ratio is applied to re-scale the number of gill net vessels (GN) participating (or modelled) during a fishery opening into a “purse seine equivalent” (EPS):\n\n𝐸𝑃𝑆 =\n\n𝐶𝑃𝑈𝐸𝐺𝑁 𝐶𝑃𝑈𝐸𝑃𝑆\n∙ 𝐸𝐺𝑁\nwhere E refers to fishing effort.\nThe Planning Model applies a fixed 0.2 CPUE ratio to “convert” the number of gill net vessels into an equivalent number of purse seine vessels (i.e., the effort associated with five gill nets is equivalent to the effort of one purse seine). The original analysis resulting in the application of the CPUE ratio for effort scaling has not been identified, although similar conversions of vessel effort to purse seine equivalents using CPUE ratios have been applied in other fisheries. e.g., herring fisheries in the North Sea (Bjorndal and Conrad 1978).\nHarvest rates for the US mixed gear fisheries are also assumed to vary across the season (elemental harvest rates, uearly vs. ulate in Table A1). The historical analysis of purse seine equivalents from the 1980s (PSC 1990) noted that catchability in the Area 7 and 7A fisheries decreased in mid- to late August,\n58\n\fPre-season Planning: Assessment of Fisheries Plans\npotentially associated with lower catchability of Late-run fish due to behavioural differences in migration patterns (e.g. swimming lower in the water column and less accessible to gear). However, PSC Staff also hypothesized that observed seasonal differences in catchability could be associated with estimation errors related to uncertainty in Late-run reconstructions (PSC 1990). The Planning Model somewhat arbitrarily assigns a date of August 12 in Area 7 and August 14 in Area 7A to switch from “early” to “late” harvest rates, as the stock composition generally becomes weighted more heavily towards Late-run stock components around this time. However, modellers have the flexibility to redefine the time periods over which to apply each harvest rate equation.\nITQ Fisheries Canada’s Area B, E and H fisheries currently operate under an Individual Transferable Quota (ITQ) system. Their fisheries are modelled by ‘spreading’ the total catch target (CT) over the duration of the fishery opening (n) which may last 1 to 7 days (d):\n\n\n\n𝐶(𝑑) = 𝐶𝑇/𝑛.\nFor fisheries openings spanning multiple statistical areas (e.g. Area 12 and 13 purse seine), the total daily catch is proportionally assigned to each area (a) based on fishing effort (E, number of vessels):\n\n\n\n𝐶𝑎1(𝑑) =\n𝐸𝑎1 𝐴 ∑ 𝐸𝑎 𝑎1\n∙ 𝐶𝑇(𝑑).\nOn a given day, the catch is converted to a harvest rate (h) by dividing the catch by the number of salmon exposed to the fishery:\n\n\n\nℎ(𝑑) = 𝐶(𝑑) 𝑁(𝑑)\n⁄\nThe resulting harvest rate is then applied across the different stock groups, assuming equal catchability. Daily harvest rates are capped at thresholds (hT) to prevent unrealistic catches at low fish abundance:\n\n\n\nℎ(𝑑) = 𝑚𝑖𝑛 {\nℎ𝑇, 𝐶(𝑑)\n𝑁(𝑑)\n}.\nIf daily catch targets are not met early in the opening (i.e., C(d) &lt; CT(d)), the remaining catch is redistributed across subsequent days until the total catch target (CT) is reached:\n\n\n\n𝐼𝑓 𝐶(𝑑) &lt; 𝐶𝑇 , 𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑛 𝐶(𝑑 + 1: 𝐷 − 1) = 𝐶𝑇 − ∑\n𝐷 𝑑=1\n𝐶(𝑑)\n,\nwhere CT is the total target catch over the course of an ITQ opening, d is fishing day, and D is the number of days in an opening. This approach assumes that the fishery will operate in a manner which increases the probability of reaching the target catch applied to the opening.\nTest Fisheries Gill net test fisheries are assumed to land all catches estimated using historically derived, time varying, harvest rates (Chapter B4). Landed catches from purse seine test fisheries to meet scientific sampling requirements are calculated outside of the Planning Model and entered as fixed catch deductions (Chapter A5). By default, all other sockeye encountered by the purse seine test fisheries are assumed to\n59\n\fPre-season Planning: Assessment of Fisheries Plans\nbe released. However, to offset the cost of test fishing operations in some years, the purse seine test fisheries may retain their sockeye, and/or pink salmon catch on some days. During retention periods, the purse seine test fisheries are modelled using the ITQ catch equations, with total target catches and opening dates provided by PSC Staff.\nCATCH AND ESCAPEMENT PROJECTIONS\nFish Vulnerability In addition to the harvest rate calculations, the catch on a given day of a fishery opening will also depend on the number of fish vulnerable to the opening. As discussed in Chapter A8, the Planning Model assumes that fish migrate through fishing areas on a daily time-step and assuming fixed order of movement (i.e. “boxcar” reconstruction). The number of daily blocks of fish migration exposed to a fishery depend on the size of the management area, the number of days a fishery is open, and the speed with which salmon migrate through the fishery. In some cases, the same group of fish might be exposed to fishing pressure over multiple days of an opening, or in sequential openings occurring in downstream areas. The Planning Model calculates the number of fish escaping from a fishery on a daily basis, so that the vulnerable population becomes smaller over multiple days of exposure.\nInstantaneous Harvest Rates To facilitate the modelling of simultaneous fisheries and short-fishery openings (&lt; 1 day), daily harvest rates (h) were re-scaled in the current Planning model as instantaneous fishing mortality rates (F) , where:\n\n𝐹 = (−1 ∗ 𝑙𝑜𝑔(1 − ℎ)).\n\nThe resulting catch for a single day is then calculated as:\n\n𝐶(𝑑) = (1 − 𝑒−𝐹) ∙ 𝑁(𝑑)\n\nwhere C(d) is catch on a given day, N(d) is the total number of fish exposed to a given fishery (i.e., may include one or multiple daily “blocks” of fish migration) and d is fishing day. The above re-scaling does not impact catch estimation when there is only a single fishery targeting a block of fish, but becomes important during simultaneous fishery modelling. Catch on subsequent days, or in subsequent areas, is then a function of the number of fish in each daily migration block escaping from the previous opening, where N(d+1) is the total abundance escaping from the fishery on day d:\n\n\n\n𝑁(𝑑 + 1) = 𝑁(𝑑) − 𝐶(𝑑).\nFisheries removals are indexed both by fishing day, as well as by daily migration block to calculate both daily escapements and to summarise catches. The model also summarises daily escapement from every statistical area for each stock. The impact of changes to fishing area size, partial area closures, assumed slowing or speeding up of fish through an area etc., can all be easily modelled through a simple change to the data input files.\nInstantaneous fishing mortality equations can be expanded to model multiple simultaneous sources of mortality, such as when more than one fishery is operating in the same area at the same time, or with the potential future inclusion of natural sources of mortality. To do so, the total catch is first calculated using:\n60\n\fPre-season Planning: Assessment of Fisheries Plans\n\n\n\n𝐶(𝑑) = (1 − 𝑒− ∑ 𝐹𝑛\n1 ) ∙ 𝑁(𝑑)\nThe catch is then partitioned across n fisheries (or alternative sources of mortality) using:\n\n\n\n𝐶(𝑑)𝑛 = 𝐶(𝑑) ∗\n𝐹𝑛 ∑ 𝐹𝑛 1\nWhile derby fisheries can operate simultaneously and for fractions of a day, an order of operations must still be assumed for ITQ fisheries. By default, ITQ fisheries operating in the same area on the same date are assumed to take place after any simultaneous derby fisheries, i.e., ITQ harvest rate equations are based on the abundance of fish escaping from concurrent derby fisheries. From a practical standpoint, this model simplification only impacts ITQ catches in scenarios of low abundance relative to target catch, in which case harvest thresholds may be triggered.\nFishery Induced Mortalities (FIMs) In addition to landed catch, the Planning Model also models the mortality associated with the non- retention of sockeye catches during pink-directed fishery openings i.e., fishery induced mortalities (FIMs). The assumed loss of fish is calculated by multiplying the harvest rate associated with a directed fishery by a gear-specific FIM rate (see Table A1). For the purposes of escapement calculations, FIMs are removed from daily migration blocks of salmon in the same way as landed catch; however, FIMs are tracked separately for the purposes of catch accounting.\nPlanned Changes and Potential Areas for Improvement Most harvest rate equations within the Planning Model were parameterised using data from years with very different fisheries, and fish conditions compared to current. It also has been noted that some of the US harvest rate equations produce negative values when fleet size drops below a certain threshold.\nGiven the changes in fish abundance, fleet size, and fishing technology over the last 40 years, the parameterisation of these fisheries (Table A1) requires updating and should be interpreted with caution.\n61\n\fPre-season Planning: Assessment of Fisheries Plans\nReferences Bjorndal, T. and Conrad, J.M. 1987.

In-Season Assessments\n65\n\fIn-season Assessments: Fisheries Information\nB1. PSC Test Fisheries\nE. Taylor\nSummary The Pacific Salmon Commission funds and operates test fisheries to inform bilateral decisions of the Fraser River Panel through the collection of data on Fraser River sockeye and pink salmon in southern British Columbia and northern Washington State. These test fisheries provide information on abundance, timing, and diversion rates as well as species and stock composition information for use in stock assessments to inform fisheries management. PSC Secretariat involvement in these test fisheries ranges from financial assistance to complete responsibility for day-to-day operations. This report outlines the purpose of Panel approved PSC test fisheries, administrative responsibilities, as well as funding of the test fishing program.\nIntroduction The Pacific Salmon Commission (PSC), and its predecessor the International Pacific Salmon Fisheries Commission, have operated test fisheries to obtain data required to inform bilateral decisions of the Fraser River Panel since the 1960s. These test fisheries are authorised under the Pacific Salmon Treaty to assess Fraser River sockeye and pink salmon and occur in three key geographic areas (Figure 1): the northern and southern marine approaches to the Fraser River (Johnstone Strait, and the Strait of Juan de Fuca, respectively) and the lower Fraser River.\nFigure 1. Map of PSC test fisheries, consisting of marine test fisheries in Johnstone Strait (Round Island and Naka Creek gillnet test fisheries, Upper (Area 12/Blinkhorn) and Lower (Area 13) Johnstone Strait purse seine fisheries) and Juan de Fuca Strait (Area 20 gillnet and purse seine test fisheries, Neah Bay (Area 4B,5) gillnet test fishery, Area 7 US reef net test fishery), in the Strait of Georgia (Gulf troll test fishery) and in-river gillnet test fisheries at Cottonwood, Brownsville Bar, Whonnock and Qualark.\nTest fishing is the deployment of fishing efforts to gather information about fish either moving through or residing in a particular area. This is done by deployment of consistent fishing effort in a particular\n66\n\fIn-season Assessments: Fisheries Information\narea so that quantitative catch and biological data can be used for fisheries stock assessments (Chapter B19). Test fisheries are sometimes equipped with specialized fishing gear in order to target or avoid certain species or stocks. Additionally, test fisheries have observers aboard the vessels to monitor effort and catch (Chapter B2) as well as collect biological data and samples (Chapter B5) for use in stock assessment. Gear types used by the PSC test fisheries include purse seines, gill nets (both single and variable mesh), troll/hook and line, and reef nets.\nTable 1.

Table 1 provides an overview of the different PSC Panel approved test fisheries. The raw data provided by the test fisheries are catch by stock and species (based on sampling), effort, and other biological information such as age, sex, and weight (Chapter B6). Collectively across the test fishery program, these data are used as inputs to the PSC models to assess abundance (Chapter B18), timing, the diversion rate, stock (Chapters B7-B9) and species composition (Chapter B16), vulnerability (which stocks are susceptible to capture by particular gear in particular areas) and catchability (the proportion of the available abundance captured per unit of effort) (Chapters B3-B4). In addition to providing inputs into the PSC’s in-season modeling process, the data from various test fisheries are sometimes used to project the magnitude of catches in potential fisheries. Individual test fisheries can also provide relevant information on local abundances for certain users. Finally, many of the test fisheries also catch non-target stocks and other salmon species, which provides an incidental source of information on those stocks and species.\nDuring 2016 and 2017, two workshops were commissioned to compile available information on historic and existing test fisheries, to gather input from a variety of experts in both Canada and the United States, as well as to undertake technical analyses. The results of these workshops and resulting technical review was published in a technical report and provides further details regarding the purpose of the various test fisheries (Nelitz et al. 2018).\nADMINISTRATION\nPanel approved test fisheries are operated in-season to provide information to the Panel in support of Fraser River sockeye and pink salmon management. All Panel approved test fisheries are overseen by PSC Secretariat staff and the Panel. They are funded and approved through the Panel process and any decisions that 1) influence the financial state of the PSC test fishing program, 2) affect mortality of Fraser River sockeye and pink salmon, or 3) affect the Panels ability to manage Fraser River sockeye and pink salmon are made by the Panel with advice from PSC staff. In general, day-to-day operations are the responsibilities of PSC staff, DFO staff, and First Nations administrators and major decisions and direction is the responsibility of the Panel.\nTest fisheries fall under two categories depending on whether they occur within Panel Area waters or not (Figure 2). Test fisheries occurring in Areas 12 and 13 as well as upstream of the Mission Bridge take place in Non-Panel Area waters, are operated by Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO), and involve administrative assistance from First Nations whose traditional territory the test fisheries are operated within. The test fisheries within Johnstone Strait are administered by the Namgis A-Tlegay Fisheries Partnership. The Qualark Gillnet test fishery, located in the Fraser canyon near Yale, is operated by DFO with support from Yale First Nation. DFO is responsible for selecting test fishing contractors and fish buyers. The remaining test fisheries occur within Panel Area waters and are operated by PSC Secretariat staff. Selection of test fishers and buyers, as well as financial accounting for these test fisheries are all performed by PSC Secretariat staff.\n68\n\fIn-season Assessments: Fisheries Information\nPanel approved PSC test fisheries\nPanel waters\nNon-Panel waters\nCanadian waters\nU.S. waters\nFigure 2. Hierarchy table of Panel approved PSC test fisheries depending on location.\nFUNDING\nThe funding of test fisheries has changed substantially over the years. In 2006, a decision from the Federal Court of Canada determined that it was illegal for the federal government to set aside a portion of a public resource, i.e. fish, to finance research activities (Larocque v. Canada 2006). Prior to the Larocque decision, test fishers could be paid based on a portion of the value of the test fishing catch and fish could be retained above and beyond the amount needed to pay for the test fishing program. Between 2006 and 2012, the Canadian federal government’s ability to retain fish to finance research activities was in flux. These years, referred to as “The Larocque Years”, were characterized by changes to fisher payments and policies regarding the retention of fish. Fishers were required to be paid a fixed daily rate, and only fish required for samples and those unavoidably killed during test fishing activities could be sold. Currently, fishers are still paid a fixed rate but additional fish retention to fund test fishing activities is possible under the Test Fishing Policy (PSC 2021a).\nWhile the test fishing program is generally funded through the sale of fish, recently the sale of fish from the test fisheries is insufficient to cover the costs of the test fishing program in most years. In this case, Canada and the US are responsible for funding the remainder of the test fishing costs and do so through the use of the Test Fishing Revolving Fund (TFRF). The PSC maintains the TFRF to stabilize the financial status of the PSC test fishing program. Contributions to the revolving fund are either made directly by the Parties, or from surpluses from the sale of fish caught and retaining in the test fisheries. Withdrawals from the revolving fund occur in years where test fishing operational costs exceed incomes generated from the sale of fish. The Test Fishing Policy and Financial Regulation was developed by the Parties in 2021 to outline the criteria required for the discretionary retention of fish as well as to define the regulations determining how deficits and surpluses would be shared by the Parties (PSC 2021b).\nPlanned Changes and Potential Areas for Improvement Many of the planned changes and potential areas of improvement are outlined in the Summary of a Review of Fraser River Test Fisheries (Nelitz et al. 2018). In addition, there are ongoing modifications to the test fishing program to reduce costs and increase the information gained per dollar spent.\n69\n\fIn-season Assessments: Fisheries Information\nReferences Larocque v.

Catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) Calculations\nE. Taylor\nSummary Catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) is arguably the most important test fishing data to estimate abundances. The Pacific Salmon Commission (PSC) relies on four different test fishing gear types to assess the abundance of Fraser River sockeye salmon: 1) seine nets, 2) gill nets, 3) troll/hook and line, and 4) reef nets. In most cases the calculation of CPUE is based on catch and fishing effort, whereby the effort will be gear dependent. But in some cases, the CPUE may be corrected to account for gear saturation or other factors that may bias the relationship between abundance and CPUE. The following report provides an overview of the calculation of CPUE for the different PSC test fisheries.\nIntroduction As part of the Pacific Salmon Treaty agreements (PST 2020, Chapter 4), the Fraser River Panel is responsible for conducting test fisheries on Fraser River sockeye salmon. Test fishery data include catch- per-unit-effort (CPUE) data that, when multiplied by an expansion line (inverse catchability, Chapters B3- B4), provides an estimate of daily abundance. CPUE data are calculated differently depending on the type of gear and the associated measure of fishing effort. The four gear types employed by PSC test fisheries are purse seine, gill net, troll, and reef net. Additionally, the in-river gill nets differ slightly from their marine counterparts and require the use of a catchability correction factor when catches are above a certain level. The following report will describe the calculation of CPUE for each of the four gear types.\nData Before discussing CPUE calculations, it is important to define what catch and fishing effort data will be used in the calculation of CPUE. During test fishing operations, the quality of catch data is often negatively impacted by weather, equipment failure, and/or tides and currents. Under these circumstances, the test fishing skipper and observer are asked to assign a quality score of 2, 1, or 0 to the collected data. A score of 2 signifies that the data is of good quality and there were no issues to note. A quality score of 1 signifies that there were one or more issues with the collected data, but that the skipper and observer agreed that the issues did not result in the catch being unrepresentative of what would have been caught had there been no issues. Finally, a quality score of 0 signifies that the skipper and observer deem the catch being unrepresentative of what would have been caught had no issues occurred. All catch data with a set quality score of 0 are marked as non-assessment data and are excluded from calculations of CPUE.\nMethods\nPURSE SEINE TEST FISHERIES\nThe calculation of sockeye CPUE in the purse seine test fisheries is the simplest among all the gear types, as the total sockeye purse seine catch on a given day (C) is divided by the number of assessment sets performed, i.e. the fishing effort (E):\n\n\n\n𝐶𝑃𝑈𝐸 =\n𝐶 𝐸\n71\n\fIn-season Assessments: Fisheries Information\nUnder normal circumstances, the purse seine test fisheries perform six sets per day. In case of mechanical failure or in case the quality of a set is deemed compromised, the number of sets and the catch are adjusted accordingly.\nGILLNET TEST FISHERIES\nGillnet test fishery CPUE calculations are a bit more complicated as gill net fishing effort (E) calculations consider the length of the net as well as the length of time the fishing net is in use, i.e., the soak time:\n\n\n\n𝐸 =\n𝑁𝑒𝑡 𝐿𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑡ℎ (𝑓𝑎𝑡ℎ𝑜𝑚)× 𝑆𝑜𝑎𝑘 𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑒 1000\nThe soak time is calculated as the time the net is entirely in the water, plus half of the time that it takes to set the net and to retrieve it:\n\n\n\n𝑆𝑜𝑎𝑘 𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑒 = 𝑆𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑡 𝑂𝑢𝑡 𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑒 − 𝐹𝑢𝑙𝑙 𝐼𝑛 𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑒\n\n\n\n𝐹𝑢𝑙𝑙 𝐼𝑛 𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑒 − 𝑆𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑡 𝐼𝑛 𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑒 2 𝐹𝑢𝑙𝑙 𝑂𝑢𝑡 𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑒 − 𝑆𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑡 𝑂𝑢𝑡 𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑒 2\n\n\n\nThe CPUE is then calculated by the total number of sockeye caught, divided by fishing effort (equation 1).\nThe efficiency of salmon gill nets is affected by several technical and biological factors. One such technical factor, gear saturation, occurs when the gill net loses its efficiency as a greater number of target individuals are present in the net. In the lower Fraser River gillnet test fisheries, this saturation results in a reduced catch rate or catchability through either space limitation, or gear avoidance. Catchability corrections factors are used to adjust the catch rate when the total number of salmon caught in the gill net is so large that it restricts the catch rate of additional salmon. Historically, a catch level of 50 total salmon in a single set is thought to be the point where the relationship between total salmon CPUE and total salmon catch begins to become non-linear, to the extent that a catchability correction factor should be applied.\nWhen the total salmon catch is larger than 50, the sockeye CPUE is calculated as:\n\n\n\n𝐶𝑃𝑈𝐸𝑠𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑒𝑦𝑒 = 𝐶𝑠𝑜𝑐𝑘𝑒𝑦𝑒 × 𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑓𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑜𝑟\nThe methodology used to calculate a correction factor is the slope of the regression line fitted through catch and CPUE data of sets with less than 50 salmon caught. Under these conditions, it is believed that gear saturation is minimal. The total salmon catch is the independent variable and the uncorrected total salmon CPUE is the dependant variable. When this linear regression is performed, the intercept is forced to zero. Figure 1 illustrates the derivation of the correction factor for the Whonnock sockeye gillnet test fishery.\nThis regression is re-run each year separately for the Whonnock and Cottonwood gillnet test fisheries. The analysis is performed on a subset of historical data, based on the fisher, the net used, and recency. Updates to the gill net correction factor are only made when it deviates substantially from other years. Analyses have not been performed to determine quantitatively the catch level where the relationship becomes non-linear.\n72\n\fIn-season Assessments: Fisheries Information\nFigure 1. Salmon catch and catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) in Whonnock gillnet test fishery sets in the years 2010, 2014, and 2018. The blue line represents a slope of 0.15 and was generated by running a linear regression on sets where less than 50 salmon were caught. As total salmon catch increases past 50, the salmon CPUE does not continue to increase linearly. This effect is believed to be due to gear saturation of the gill net.\nTROLL TEST FISHERIES\nCPUE in hook and line fisheries are tricky measures to estimate. It is obvious that effort is some function of time and the amount of gear used, however, once a hook has caught a fish, it is no longer fishing. The dynamics of the decline in effort of a fishing line with hooks was the subject of a study in 1989 (Cave, unpublished). It concluded that unbiased measures of CPUE (catch/1000 hook-minutes) were well related to gross measures of catch, total minutes fished, and average number of hooks per line. Unbiased sockeye CPUEs was calculated as (Cave 1997):\n\n\n\n𝐶𝑃𝑈𝐸𝑠 =\n𝐶𝑠 𝐶𝑇\n𝑒(𝑖+𝑎1 𝑙𝑛 𝐶𝑃𝑈𝐸𝑇+𝑎2(𝑙𝑛 𝐶𝑃𝑈𝐸𝑇)2)\nWhere Cs/CT is the proportion of sockeye (s) in the total catch (CT) and CPUET is the unadjusted all- species catch-per-unit-effort. The latter is based on the catch of all target and non-target species including shakers (under-sized juvenile salmonids) and effort in 1000 hook-minutes, calculated as:\n\n\n\n𝐸𝑓𝑓𝑜𝑟𝑡 =\n𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑘𝑠 × 𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑢𝑡𝑒𝑠 𝑓𝑖𝑠ℎ𝑒𝑑 1000\nThe regression constants are i = 0.123, a1 = 1.012 and a2=0.0746.\nThe PSC Troll test fishery fishes in six different statistical areas called quadrants. The CPUE for a survey period is estimated by weighing the CPUE of each quadrant by the proportion (Pq) each quadrant represents of the survey area:\n\n\n\n𝐶𝑃𝑈𝐸 = ∑\n𝑞=1→6\n(𝐶𝑃𝑈𝐸𝑞 × 𝑃𝑞)\nThe proportions of the total survey area by quadrant are listed in Table 1.\n73\n\fIn-season Assessments: Fisheries Information\nTable 1.

Fishing effort in the reef net test fishery is strictly the number of minutes spent counting. There are no adjustments made to CPUE based on fish abundance or counting conditions.\nPlanned Changes and Potential Areas for Improvement Under the current workflow, gill net correction factors are calculated pre-season based on historic data and this correction factor is applied to in-season catches. In the future, it may be beneficial to calculate season specific correction factors and make in-season adjustments to the daily CPUEs.\nReferences Cave, J. 1997. Review of Area 29 Troll Test Fishing.

In-river Catchability Estimates\nS. Wong and M.J. Hague\nSummary Mission hydroacoustic data is the primary source for estimating daily sockeye salmon abundances in the lower Fraser River. However, in cases when sockeye estimates based on hydroacoustic data are either (1) unavailable, or (2) unreliable due to dominance of other salmon species, catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) data from the Whonnock test fishery can provide alternative sockeye passage estimates. However, high variability in the historical Whonnock expansion line (inverse of the catchability) results in uncertain abundance estimates when derived from CPUE data. The following report describes the derivation of the historical expansion line (EL) estimates that can be applied in-season to estimate sockeye passage in the absence of hydroacoustic assessments (Chapter B18). It also describes the criteria used to decide when historical expansion lines should be adjusted based on the information observed in-season.\nIntroduction As part of the Pacific Salmon Treaty agreements (PST 2020, Chapter 4), the Fraser River Panel is responsible for the enumeration of sockeye and pink salmon escapement in the Fraser River. Traditionally this is done through the collection of hydroacoustic data at Mission, B.C. (Chapter B10). The resulting total salmon estimates are divided among the species present through the application of species composition estimates derived from test fishing catches collected by the gillnet test fishery at Whonnock (Chapter B16). On odd years, when pink salmon are the dominant species (late August - September) and the uncertainty associated with the species composition is large, sockeye abundance is instead derived directly from the Whonnock catch-per-unit effort (CPUE) by multiplying this estimate with an in-river expansion line (1/catchability). In addition, Whonnock CPUE-based abundance estimates are also used when the Mission hydroacoustic program is not operational, e.g., during high discharge periods, before the hydroacoustic program has started, or after it has shut down for the season.\nCPUE-based abundance estimates rely on catchability estimates which are derived based on historical observations of CPUE and abundance. It is a well-recognized fact that catchability can vary across a multitude of factors and rarely displays a linear relationship with fish abundance (Brannian 1982). As such, Whonnock CPUE-based estimates of sockeye salmon abundance are inherently more uncertain than hydroacoustic-based estimates. An understanding of the key variables that affect the Whonnock expansion line is therefore critical to determine what expansion line estimate should be applied to in- season CPUE data to produce the best abundance estimates and reduce the associated uncertainty. The following report describes the method used to derive historical sockeye expansion line estimates for the in-river gillnet test fishery at Whonnock as well as the criteria used to decide when historical expansion lines should be adjusted based on the information observed in-season.\nData The primary purpose of the Whonnock gillnet test fishery in the lower Fraser River is to collect species composition information (Nelitz et al. 2018). When using CPUE data from this test fishery to derive sockeye abundance, the associated catchability or expansion line (1/catchability) needs to be estimated based on historical data. Expansion lines are calculated by dividing an estimate of “true” abundance,\n75\n\fIn-season Assessments: Fisheries Information\nsuch as hydroacoustic-based passage, by test fishery CPUE. For this analysis, historical CPUE data and hydroacoustic-based sockeye abundance estimates in the lower Fraser River from 2008 to 2020 were used. The CPUE data were derived by dividing the number of gilled and girthed sockeye salmon by the fishing effort. The fishing effort in turn was derived by multiplying the length of the fishing net/1000 by the fishing time, i.e., the time the whole net is in the water plus half of the setting and picking time.\nIn addition to the Whonnock test fishery data and sockeye abundance estimates, a series of associated metadata were included in the analyses to evaluate trends, i.e. information about the day, year, and fishing location (Whonnock Channel or Glenn Valley Bar). Additional covariates were explored to evaluate their impact on catchability: total catch, sockeye catch, sockeye passage, number of seals, discharge levels, water temperature and wind direction (Table 1).\nFor the in-season application of expansion line estimates, the corrected CPUE data from the test fishing database were used. The correction factor applied to gillnet CPUE data accounts for the saturation effect. In addition, only days with total gilled, girthed and tangled catch of at least five fish were used to calculate the historical expansion lines and applied to in-season CPUE data.\nMethods The analysis of the in-river expansion line only included CPUE data for days where at least five sockeye were caught, to remove the impact of small sample sizes on the uncertainty associated with the expansion line. To further reduce the impact of the variability in test fishing catches on the analysis, expansion line estimates had been based on six days of observations, identical to the approach applied to derive expansion line estimates for marine test fisheries. Therefore, expansion line estimates for a given day were calculated using total passage and total CPUE over six days, covering three days before and two days after the day of interest. If a 6-day period contained less than 4 days with sufficient catches, the estimates for this period were not included in the analysis.\nCorrelation and trend analyses such as linear regressions (in case of continuous variables) and ANOVAs (in case of categorical variables) were conducted to identify covariates that could explain a significant proportion of the historical variance in expansion lines with the aim to improve in-season predictions. Because of the noted temporal trend in the expansion line estimates across the season, additional cross correlation analyses were conducted for the other covariables that removed the effect of the day of the year on the expansion line. Because the change in expansion line across the season is not necessarily linear, the expansion line data were also summarized by calculating the mean expansion line over a period of two weeks based on the geometric means of the daily estimates across subsets of years. This allowed to assess trends across all years, all years excluding the 2018 cycle line, by cycle line, even years only, and odd years only.\nResults There is a high degree of variability in historical expansion lines – with values based on 6 days of data ranging from 558 to 109,978 after the catch threshold of ≥ 5 sockeye salmon was applied (Figure 1). Regressions between expansion line and day demonstrated a positive correlation (R2=0.28, p-value &lt; 0.001), with expansion line increasing throughout the season (Figure 1B). This trend was consistent across years, with greater variation in expansion lines within than between years (Figure 1). In addition to the temporal trend, significant correlations were noted for several covariates: sockeye passage, total catch, discharge, fishing location, sockeye catch and water temperature, even though the correlation for the latter two were very low, with an R2 of 0.09 and 0.03, respectively. The differences in expansion lines between fishing location was significant but this was mainly due to differences in discharge as the test fishery was most often in operation at Glen Valley Bar during periods of high discharge earlier in the\n76\n\fIn-season Assessments: Fisheries Information\nseason. Year, seal presence and wind direction were unable to explain the variation in expansion lines. In the case of seal predation, this could be due to the uncertainty in the seal data, which are based on visual observations from the observer aboard the test fishing vessel.\nFigure 1. Boxplot of 6-day expansion lines by year (A) and by in-season period across years (B).\nAlternatively, multiple regression models with interactions between day or discharge, and catch, passage or water temperature generally explained more variation in the expansion line data than models without the interaction term. The two co-variates which explained the greatest percentage of the historical variability in Whonnock expansion line were day and sockeye passage past Mission (Table 1). Given that expansion lines are derived based on total sockeye abundance, it makes sense that sockeye passage explained a lot of the variation in expansion line, but it would not be possible to utilise this variable in-season as typically CPUE-based abundance estimates are needed in-season when hydroacoustic-based sockeye abundances are not available or unreliable. Day of the year is a good proxy for abundance, with abundances being low for Early Stuart and increasing later in the season when Summer-run and Late-run sockeye enter in the river. This explains the significant correlation of the expansion line with day.\n77\n\fIn-season Assessments: Fisheries Information\nTable 1. Overview of the relationship between expansion line and various covariates. When the variable was continuous, a linear regression was performed, and the table notes the coefficient of determination (R2) and if the correlation was significant (, p-value &lt; 0.001). When the variable was categorical, an ANOVA was performed and significance (, p-value &lt; 0.001) indicates that the variation in expansion line between groups is larger than the within-group variation.\nVariable\nDay Year Fishing location log10 Total catch log10 Sockeye catch log10 Sockeye passage at Mission Number of seals present Discharge Water temperature Wind direction\n\nExpansion Line\n\nVariable 0.28 0.003  0.17 0.09 0.30 - 0.15 0.03* -\n\n\nR2\n\nExpansion Line\n\nVariable * Day\n\n\n0.37 0.32 0.45*\n\n0.27*\n\n\n\n\nExpansion Line ~ Variable * Discharge - - - 0.30 0.22 0.36 - - 0.16 -\nThe pattern in abundance is not consistent across years but differs by cycle line, with the dominant 2018 cycle line seeing a sharper increase in sockeye abundance compared to other cycle line years when later-timed Early Summer-run sockeye enter into the river. On 2020 cycle line years, overall abundance trends downward faster compared to other years, while on odd cycle line years it is the increase in pink abundance later in the season that increases overall salmon abundance. Summarising the historical expansion line data for two-week periods shows a stepwise increase in expansion lines across the season (Table 2) that fits well to the observations across all years (Figure 2). Across cycle lines, the 2018 cycle line shows an increase in expansion line in the beginning of August while on odd years, this increase only occurs in September when pink salmon increase overall salmon abundance in the river. In comparison, on 2020 cycle years, most of the run would have already migrated past Mission at the start of September.\nTable 2.

The geometric means of the 6-day expansion lines across all years are presented as grey dots. Historical expansion lines were calculated using corrected CPUE data from the test-fishing database for days with at least 5 salmon caught.\nIN-SEASON APPLICATION\nIn absence of other sources of in-season information, the historical expansion line estimates (Table 2, Figure 2) can be applied directly to corrected Whonnock CPUE data. Given the limited historical data available early in the season, averages should be calculated across all years until July 15th (Figure 3). Later in the season, the expansion line applied may vary by cycle year and depend on the correspondence of the historical expansion lines with the expansion line observed in-season. In case the historical expansion line deviates substantially with the in-season estimates (for periods dominated by sockeye salmon when such comparisons can be made), the average ratio between observed and historical expansion lines can be used to rescale the historical expansion line up or down for the remainder of the season. This approach both adjusts for in-season conditions while still accounting for historical patterns of seasonality. Given the high variability in CPUE based abundance estimates, the implied species composition estimate should continuously be monitored and compared to other observations of species composition to ensure resulting sockeye abundance estimates fall within realistic ranges. A full overview of the decisions in terms of in-season expansion line estimates can be found in Figure 3.\n79\n\fIn-season Assessments: Fisheries Information\nFigure 3. A decision-flow diagram for selecting in-season Whonnock expansion line estimates to estimate daily sockeye abundances.\nPlanned Changes and Potential Areas for Improvement Current results are based on a limited dataset that only includes 2008-2020. Data are especially limited at the start and the end of the season, especially on non-dominant years (years excluding the 2018 cycle). This especially impacts sockeye abundance estimates on odd years when pink salmon are in the river as the assumed expansion line will have been mainly derived from data collected when no pinks were in the river and when Late-run stocks were dominating sockeye abundance. The potential bias this may create should be examined. In addition, while the two-week periods generally match the pattern of increasing expansion line well throughout the season, resulting abundance estimates are more likely to be biased around the time of the step increase. The impacts of using a stepped method rather than a linear increase could be further investigated. Finally, knowledge from fishers suggests that both water clarity and fish size impact catchability and thus could potentially aid in exposing patterns in expansion lines.\nReferences Brannian, L.K. 1982.

Marine Catchability Estimates\nC.G.J. Michielsens\nSummary In-season run size assessments for Fraser River sockeye salmon rely on estimates of daily abundance (Chapter B18). The most seaward daily abundance estimates come from marine test fisheries in Johnstone Strait (Area 12) and Juan de Fuca Strait (Area 20). The catch-per-unit- effort (CPUE) data from these test fisheries (Chapter B2) can be used in combination with an expansion line estimate (inverse catchability) to derive daily abundances. At the start of the season, a historical expansion line estimate is applied, derived from data for past years. Due to the high variability in expansion lines, both between years and within a season, the predicted abundances based on CPUE data used in combination with historical expansion lines may deviate substantially from reconstructed abundances based on Mission hydroacoustic data and seaward catch. Predicted abundance estimates can be improved if the expansion line is updated using in-season observations. The following report provides an overview of the evaluation of different historical and in-season expansion line estimates for marine gillnet and purse seine test fisheries.\nIntroduction As part of the Pacific Salmon Treaty agreements (PST 2020, Chapter 4), the Fraser River Panel is responsible for conducting test fisheries on Fraser River sockeye salmon. Test fishery data include catch- per-unit-effort (CPUE) data, species composition and stock identification, and other biological metrics such as length, weight, and age. The CPUE data is a relative index that, when multiplied by an expansion line (inverse catchability), provides an estimate of daily abundance. There is a minimum 6-day lag before CPUE-based abundances can be aligned with reconstructed estimates derived from hydroacoustic data due to the travel time between marine test fishing locations and the lower Fraser River hydroacoustic site located near Mission, B.C. (Michielsens and Cave 2018). But while CPUE-based abundances provide more timely estimates, they are less accurate than reconstructed values due to the high degree of uncertainty in the associated expansion line. Early in-season, the expansion lines are based on historical data, but once there is sufficient overlap between CPUE-based and reconstructed timeseries, these estimates can be updated with in-season observations.\nEarly in-season, gillnet test fishing vessels are used to assess Early Stuart and Early Summer-run sockeye while purse seine data are traditionally used to assess Summer-run and Late-run stocks, and later-timed components of the Early Summer run (Nelitz et al. 2018). While the gillnet test fishery costs less to operate, the catchability is too low and uncertain to derive reliable abundance estimates for Summer- run and Late-run stocks. In Johnstone Strait, the Area 12 gillnet test fishery occurs at Round Island. Due to safety considerations, two gillnet vessels are used to assess abundance in the Area 20 of Juan de Fuca Strait. It is assumed to take 8 and 6 days, respectively, for sockeye observed in these gillnet test fisheries to reach the Mission hydroacoustic site. Traditionally, the primary purse seine test fishery in Johnstone Strait takes place in Area 12 (7 days seaward of Mission), but Area 13 (6 days seaward of Mission) offers an alternative test fishing location with a potentially higher catchability due to the narrower size of the Strait there. In Juan de Fuca strait, salmon encountered by the purse seine fishery in Area 20 take about 6 days to migrate to the Mission hydroacoustic site.\n82\n\fIn-season Assessments: Fisheries Information\nData Expansion line analyses relied on daily CPUE data from both purse seine and gillnet test fishing vessels (Chapter B1) and daily reconstructed abundances based on Mission hydroacoustic estimates plus seaward catches (Chapter B18). Expansion line estimates were evaluated using data from 1998 to 2014. To reduce the impact of the variability in test fishing catches on the analyses, in-season expansion line estimates were based on six days of observations. A total of 524 matched Area 12 and Area 20 daily gill net CPUE estimates, 642 matched Area 12 and Area 20 purse seine CPUE estimates, and 602 matched Area 13 and Area 20 purse seine CPUE estimates were analyzed. To evaluate density dependence, total catch data for both sockeye and pink salmon were also included in the analyses. Sockeye stocks that delay their upriver migration by holding in the Strait of Georgia, such as Late run and Harrison stocks (Lapointe et al. 2003), were analyzed separately given that the variable delay and redistribution in the Gulf violates the “boxcar” migration assumptions required for run reconstructions (Cave and Gazey 1996).\nFigure 1. Boxplot of 6-day gillnet and purse seine expansion line estimates across the season (1998 to 2014). Gill net estimates relate to Early Stuart, Early Summer-run and Summer-run stocks excluding Harrison while purse seine estimates relate to Summer-run excluding Harrison stocks. The high purse seine expansion lines in September are associated with low marine abundances.\nMethods Optimizing the in-season application of expansion line (inverse catchability) estimates to daily CPUE data requires decision rules which have been obtained through retrospective analyses that evaluate the accuracy of different marine expansion line strategies to predict abundances at Mission 6 to 8 days later (Table 1). Due to time-varying trends (Figure 1) and density-dependent effects on catchability, simply applying the lagged observed expansion line values may not provide the best estimates. In addition, because in-season daily catchabilities cannot be calculated for delaying stocks, the validity of catchability estimates derived from other stock components must be assessed.\nUsing the data from 1998 to 2014, retrospective analyses for different expansion line strategies (Table 1) were performed by predicting the total annual abundances for a given stock group (𝑁𝑦̂ ) and comparing this to the observed total abundances (𝑁𝑦). The bias (i.e. mean percent error, MPE), and precision (i.e. mean absolute percent error, MAPE) of the predicted annual abundances were calculated using:\n\n\n\n\nMPE=\n100 n\n∙ ∑\n𝑁̂𝑦−𝑁𝑦 𝑁𝑦\nMAPE=\n100 n\n∙ ∑ |\n𝑁̂𝑦−𝑁𝑦 𝑁𝑦\n\n83\n\fIn-season Assessments: Fisheries Information\nwhere 𝑁𝑦̂ is the predicted total annual abundance, derived from the daily Johnstone Strait (A12 or 13) and Juan de Fuca Strait (A20) CPUE data and the expansion line (1/catchability, q):\n\n\n\n𝑁𝑦̂ = ∑ (\n𝑑\n𝐶𝑃𝑈𝐸𝑦,𝑑,𝐴20 𝑞𝑦,𝑑,𝐴20\n\n\n\n𝐶𝑃𝑈𝐸𝑦,𝑑,𝐴12 𝑞𝑦,𝑑,𝐴12\n)\n.\nWhen using Area 13 purse seine data, catches seaward of the Area 13 purse seine test fishery (𝐶𝑦,𝑑,𝑆𝑒𝑎𝐴13) are added to predict the abundance in Area 12.\n\n\n\n𝑁𝑦̂ = ∑ (\n𝑑\n𝐶𝑃𝑈𝐸𝑦,𝑑,𝐴20 𝑞𝑦,𝑑,𝐴20\n\n\n\n𝐶𝑃𝑈𝐸𝑦,𝑑,𝐴13 𝑞𝑦,𝑑,𝐴13\n. + 𝐶𝑦,𝑑,𝑆𝑒𝑎𝐴13)\nFor gillnet (GN) test fisheries, it was assumed that the sockeye catchability is the same in both test fisheries:\n\n\n\n𝑞𝐺𝑁,𝐴20=𝑞𝐺𝑁,𝐴12.\nThe relative catchability of the different purse seine test fisheries was assumed to be related to the relative width of the area swept or sampled, i.e., the width of the migratory channel at the test fishing site in relation to the size of the fishing net. Because the relative width of the area swept in Johnstone Straight is 2.2 times larger than in Juan de Fuca Strait, it is assumed that the sockeye catchability of the purse seine test fishery in Area 12 is 2.2 times greater than in Area 20:\n\n\n\nqPS,A12=2.2 ∙ qPS,A20.\nSimilarly, the catchability in Area 13 is assumed to be 1.5 times greater than the in Area 12:\n\n\n\nqPS,A13=1.5 ∙ qPS,A12.\nBecause the catchabilities of the different fisheries are assumed to be related, often only Area 20 expansion lines are reported (1/𝑞𝑦,𝑑,𝐴20).\nTable 1 provides an overview of the main in-season expansion line strategies for the different stock groups and test fisheries that have been evaluated to determine the optimal approach for estimating 𝑞𝑦,𝑑,𝐴20. Performance of the strategies was evaluated for different subsets of years: (1) all years, (2) recent 8 years since 2007, (3) high and low abundance years, (4) pink salmon (odd) years, and (5) by cycle line. In addition to the main strategies, additional strategies evaluated the length of days on which to base the in-season expansion line (6 days versus 1 days, 3 days, all dates to date) and the size of the adjustment to the expansion line. An expansion line strategy that relied on 6 days of in-season data for example would rely on daily reconstructed abundances and CPUE data observed 7 to 12 days prior because it takes an additional 6 days to travel from the marine test fishing locations to the lower Fraser River hydroacoustic site. The resulting Area 20 in-season expansion line is calculated as follows:\n\n\n\n1 qd1,𝐴20\n= ∑\n𝑑1−12 𝑑2=𝑑1−7\n𝑁𝑑2,𝐴20\n⁄\n∑\n𝑑1−12 𝑑2=𝑑1−7\n𝐶𝑃𝑈𝐸𝑑2,𝐴20\n.\nAdjustments to in-season expansion lines allowed to account for time-varying trends across the season and density-dependent effects. Adjustments had been implemented either by multiplying the in-season expansion line for Area 20 (1/𝑞𝑦,𝑑,𝐴20) with the adjustment or by adding or subtracting the adjustment.\nComparing performance using total abundance instead of daily estimates reduced the susceptibility of the analyses to violations in migration speed assumptions and reduced the weight of low abundance days while also increasing the importance of high abundance days. In addition, comparing total estimates allowed the same performance measures to be used to assess the expansion lines for delaying Late-run and Harrison stocks.\n84\n\fIn-season Assessments: Fisheries Information\nTable 1.

Using an in- season expansion line increases the precision, but due to the lag in updating the observations, the resulting abundance estimates are biased low (Figure 2, a1 and b1, strategy 2). The bias can be corrected on average by multiplying the observed expansion line with a factor of 1.25 to account for the increasing trend (Figure 2, a1 and b1, strategy 3). Further improvements can be made by adjusting the expansion line depending on total daily catch, with smaller catch days requiring larger adjustments compared to larger catch days (Figure 2, a1 and b1, strategy 4, Table 2). When restricting the data to recent years, results are similar but slightly more pronounced (Figure 2, a2 and b2). Applying the same gill net expansion lines from non-Harrison stocks to estimate daily abundances for Harrison results in abundances that are too low, even if in-season adjusted expansion line estimates are used (Figure 1, a3). Assuming the expansion line for Harrison is double the expansion line for other stocks removes the bias and improves the precision of the daily estimates (Figure 2, a3, b3).\nFor purse seine test fishery data (Figure 3), in-season expansion lines are more precise than historical expansion estimates but, in the case of Summer run excluding Harrison, may slightly overestimate abundance unless the in-season expansion line is reduced (Figure 3, a1 and b1). Abundance estimates can be improved by adjusting the expansion line depending on total catch, with larger catch days requiring bigger downward adjustments (Table 2). Adjusting expansion lines of individual fishing sets does not seem to further improve abundance estimates. For Harrison sockeye, the best expansion line strategy relies on the in-season expansion line for Summer run excluding Harrison without adjustments (Figure 3, a2 and b2). For Late-run sockeye, the best strategy is also to rely on in-season expansion lines for Summer run but to adjust them based on total catch (Figure 3, a3 and b3). Using an historical expansion line of 230 for Late run results in unbiased but imprecise total run size estimates. A full overview of the recommended expansion line strategies is provided in Table 2.\n85\n\fIn-season Assessments: Fisheries Information\nFigure 2.

Sampling Protocol\nA.M. Phung and D. Brkic\nSummary This report reviews the sampling protocol relevant to in-season assessments of sockeye salmon. DNA and scale samples are collected regularly from test fisheries, and opportunistically from commercial fisheries as fisheries occur. This sampling design is intended to provide up-to-date stock identification data for in-season Fraser River Panel (FRP) meetings which occur twice a week. Depending on the test fishery, it typically takes between 2 and 5 days from when a fish is caught and sampled to when the data are available at FRP meetings. The delay is affected by the geographic location of the fishery, the availability of shipping services, and how samples for various fisheries are prioritized depending on changing management needs. Commercial samples are obtained at fish plants. When sampling, one scale sample and one DNA sample are collected per fish and stored respectively in a scale book and on Whatman filter sheets. Scale samples are shipped to the Pacific Salmon Commission (PSC) Secretariat office where they are read, and the metadata is stored in a database. The DNA is shipped to the Pacific Biological Station for analysis. Once the DNA has been analyzed, the data are further processed by the stock identification biologists at the PSC Secretariat office.\nIntroduction During the in-season period, the Pacific Salmon Commission (PSC) operates a suite of test fisheries along the northern (Johnstone Strait) and southern (Juan de Fuca Strait) approaches and in the lower Fraser River (Chapter B1) to obtain an index of sockeye and pink abundance throughout their migration towards Mission (Chapter B18). DNA (Chapter B9) and scale (Chapter B7) samples collected from catches in marine test fisheries give an early indication of the ages and stock composition of salmon that are returning to the Fraser River. In addition to age of fish, scale samples provide information on growth rate and can potentially be used to determine the stock of origin. Lengths and weights of fish are also often recorded in test fishery and commercial fishery sampling (Chapter B6).\nIn addition to sampling of test fishing catches, commercial catches are also sampled in-season. The main objective of the commercial catch sampling program is to gather information from DNA samples, scale samples, and biological data in order to estimate stock composition of the total commercial catch. In comparison to test fisheries, which generally collect information on sockeye migration (i.e., all of the sockeye in an area at a given time), commercial fisheries are sampled with a focus on estimating catches. The number and magnitude of commercial fishery openings vary from year to year depending on sockeye run size. When run sizes are high, the large number of samples obtained from commercial fisheries may provide better representation of the sockeye catch than test fisheries. The information from commercial catch samples is used to help determine the relative exploitation of each of the Fraser River sockeye management groups within a commercial fishery opening. This information can also contribute to run-size assessments, especially when used complementary to data from the test fisheries.\nDuring Canadian commercial fisheries openings, processing plants in the vicinities of Nanaimo and Vancouver are targeted for sampling landings. For commercial openings in northwest Washington State, processing plants in Bellingham are primarily targeted to sample landed catches.\n89\n\fIn-season Assessments: Biological Information\nSAMPLING DESIGN\nTest Fisheries The goal of sampling test fishery catches is to provide the most up-to-date stock composition information during in-season Fraser River Panel (FRP) meetings which occur on Tuesdays and Fridays. The geographic location of test fisheries coupled with limitations in air carrier services can lead to delays in data flow in-season. When fish are caught in Area 12 test fisheries, samples can take three (in the case of purse seine catch) to five (for gillnet catch) days until the stock composition data are available to be presented at the Friday FRP meetings. For the Tuesday FRP meeting, it can take three to four days after fish are caught to obtain Area 12 gillnet data and Area 12 purse seine data, respectively. When fish are caught in Area 20 test fisheries, samples can take two (purse seine) to three (gillnet) days until the data are available to be presented at the Tuesday or Friday Panel meeting. Purse seine samples are generally prioritized over gillnet samples as purse seine samples are considered to be more representative of the true population. This is because gill nets are believed to be selective towards certain stocks and fish that swim closer to the surface (Šmejkal et al. 2015), and because of size- selectivity imposed by the mesh size. The sampling schedule for collecting biological information varies depending on the test fishery. Table 1 shows the sampling schedule for 2018 and lists the target daily sample sizes for each test fishery. A sample consists of one DNA tissue “punch” (obtained using a one- hole punch on the adipose fin), one scale, and biological data including length, weight, and sex (Chapter B6). The schedule and sample sizes may vary between years depending on shipping logistics and size of the catch.\nTable 1.

Generally, the target for a sampling trip is to collect 100 samples from each commercial fishery opening by gear type and key statistical area if fish are caught. This usually results in about 200-300 samples per sampling trip. Some commercial fisheries are sampled more intensively than others depending on catch numbers, logistics, and utility of the collected information at the time to the FRP meeting. When sampling purse seine commercial fishery catches, ideally more than 100 samples would be collected per area as catches tend to be higher than for other gear types. Unlike test fisheries which follow a strict sample collection schedule outlined pre-season, samples for commercial fisheries are more challenging to plan for due to uncertainty around where and when catches are going to be landed. Table 2 provides a summary of guidelines for sampling frequency during a year with ample available TAC such as 2018. Canadian commercial catches from Areas B, D, E and H are sampled at fish plants in Vancouver while catches from Areas B, D, G and H are sampled at fish plants in Nanaimo. US commercial catches in Areas 7 and 7A are sampled at fish plants in Bellingham. In-season communication with fish plant representatives is crucial to planning sampling trips to maximize the amount of information that can be obtained.\nWhen catches are large, commercial sampling may include ratio counts. Ratio counts involve estimating the proportion of rare, visually identifiable fish types (e.g., adipose-clipped fish and/or jacks) to other fish within the catch and includes additional targeted sampling of those fish. Jacks may be an indicator of abundance for the following years, while sampling adipose-clipped fish is used to assess stocks of interest more precisely such as the Cultus Lake sockeye stock.\nTable 2. Sampling frequency guidelines for commercial fisheries by key statistical area in a high TAC year. Sampling frequency describes the number of sampling trips, not the total number of samples collected. Most sampling trips involve the collection of two or three sample sets of 100 fish from multiple statistical areas.\nFishery User Area B Area D Area E Area H Area G US-AC US-TI\nGear Type PS GN GN TR TR PS, GN, RN PS, GN, RN\nKey statistical areas Area 12, 13, 29 Area 12, 13 Area 29 Area 12, 13 and 29 Area 125, 126, 127 Area 7, 7a Area 7, 7a\nSampling frequency 3 times per week 2 times per week After every opening 1 time per week Infrequent 2 times per week 2 times per week\nMethods The protocol for collecting DNA and scale samples and biological information is the same for both test fishery and commercial fisheries. Samplers distinguish sockeye from other salmon species by following guidelines outlined in the Sampling Manuals for test fishing observers and port samplers. Scale samples, DNA samples, and/or biological data, such as fish length, weight, and sex are collected on the boat, after landing, or at a processing plant. DNA, scales and biological data are primarily collected as “matched samples”, meaning each piece of information can be traced back to the same fish. This permits comparisons of age, size, sex, and growth between and within stocks. In some instances, there are scale samples taken without associated DNA or biological information (Table 1). This “scale-only” sampling is performed because there are limitations in how many DNA samples can be analyzed due to costs and efforts needed to collect, analyze and process these samples. For commercial sampling, time is a limiting factor and sampling information is triaged. DNA has the highest priority, followed by scales, lengths, sexes, and finally weights. If time is a limiting factor due to scheduled fish plant operations, samplers may opt to exclude lower-priority information from the collection.\n91\n\fIn-season Assessments: Biological Information\nScale samples are placed in a scale book along with all the biological data from that individual salmon and the DNA sample number. The “preferred scale” is selected from each salmon unless it is missing or damaged and is located on the left side of the salmon, on the second scale row above the lateral line in a diagonal line from the posterior of the dorsal fin to the anterior of the anal fin (Figure 2). If the preferred scale is missing, the next closest scale is taken as long as it is at least two scale rows above the lateral line and behind the front of the dorsal fin. Scales higher than four scale rows above the lateral line may be sampled in rare cases if all scales near the preferred scale location are missing. This is because the characteristics of the scales on a sockeye vary dorso-ventrally (top to bottom). In this case, the sampler notes that a non-preferred scale was used. If there are no usable scales on the left side of the fish, a right-side scale may be used, but the sampler must take note of this because it can affect how the scale is read. If neither side of the fish has appropriate scales to sample, the sampler should pick another fish if there is an adequate number of fish to sample.\nFigure 2. The preferred location of the scale to sample. Scales higher than four scale rows above the lateral line are non-preferred.\nDNA samples are collected by using a one-hole punch and punching one small, thin disk from the margin of the adipose fin of the salmon. If the adipose fin is missing, a caudal fin clip is taken instead. While the sample is still wet, the DNA is placed on a Whatman sheet. The alternative storage of DNA in ethanol vials is less desirable but is used in cases where Whatman paper is not available or if heavy wind and/or rain make using Whatman sheets difficult. To prevent contamination, sampling equipment is rinsed after each sample is taken.\nThe procedures to gather biological data such as length, weight, and sex, are described in Chapter B6. Ratio counts are determined by dividing the total number of jacks or adipose-clipped fish encountered by the total number of fish counted. To conduct ratio counts in a fish plant, the number of fish without an adipose fin is counted as fish pass by on a conveyor belt as they are being off-loaded. DNA and scale samples as well as biological information are collected for jacks and fish missing their adipose fin (adipose-clipped or adipose-damaged).\n92\n\fIn-season Assessments: Biological Information\nScale samples are analyzed at the Scale Lab within the PSC Secretariat office in Downtown Vancouver. DNA samples are analyzed by the Molecular Genetics Lab at the Pacific Biological Station (PBS) in Nanaimo. For the Johnstone Strait test fisheries, test fishing observers drop off biological samples at an air carrier service to be shipped as soon as possible to Vancouver. For the Area 20 Juan de Fuca test fisheries, the test-fishing observer delivers biological samples to a contractor in Port Renfrew who drives the samples to AC Taxi in Nanaimo in the evening. In the morning, AC Taxi delivers the DNA samples to PBS and the scale samples to an air carrier service. The samples are picked up from the air carrier service in Vancouver by PSC staff. In-river DNA samples from Cottonwood and Whonnock are also flown to PBS for analysis.\nReferences Šmejkal, M., Ricard, D., Prchalová, M., Říha, M., Muška, M., Blabolil, P., and Kubečka, J. 2015.

Phung\nSummary Biological information of salmon collected by the Pacific Salmon Commission (PSC) includes length, weight, and sex information. Length measurements are used to supplement stock identification information (Chapter B9) and as inputs into models that differentiate fish species based on hydroacoustic lengths, i.e., length-based mixture models (Chapter B16). Weights in combination with lengths are important for understanding fish condition but also provide the fishing industry with information on the potential value of expected catches. Sex information is equally important as analyses of lengths and weights often requires separation of the sexes. Lengths are measured and recorded in terms of fork length, postorbital fork length (POF), and postorbital hypural length (POH). Length measurements are taken using a “POF stick” while weights are measured using industrial scales. Sex is determined by making an incision in the abdomen and inspecting the gonads by touch.\nIntroduction The Pacific Salmon Commission (PSC) collects and stores biological information – including length, weight, and sex – from salmon sampled from commercial and test fishery catches. Differences in average historical length between fish stocks may be used during stock identification to help resolve uncertain stock assignment (Chapter B9). Fish lengths also help distinguish different species within a mixture of different length estimates obtained from hydroacoustic data (Chapter B16). Multi-year records of length and weight may reveal deviations from average, which could be important in fisheries planning as larger fish are more valuable both in terms of catch and in terms of brood stock. Determining the sex of sampled fish is important as morphological differences between the sexes may lead to differential catchability in fishing gears as well as varying offload weights when fish are sold. Analyses done on length and weight data also generally require separation of the sexes.\nLENGTH DEFINITIONS\nThe Pacific Salmon Commission collects three different types of length measurements: fork length, postorbital fork length (POF), and postorbital hypural length (POH). Figure 1 shows the difference between fork length, POF, and POH.\n94\n\fIn-season Assessments: Biological Information\nPostorbital Hypural Length\nPostorbital Fork Length\nFork Length\nFigure 1. Illustration of the different salmon length measures recorded by the PSC.\nFork length is the length from the anterior-most part of the fish to the posterior end of the middle caudal rays. Fork length is best used to determine the overall size of a fish when it has deeply forked tails and difficult-to-distinguish hypural plates as is the case for salmon. The PSC uses fork lengths in the hydroacoustic length-based mixture models.\nThe postorbital fork (POF) length measures the length from the posterior of the orbit (the back of the eye) to the posterior end of the middle caudal rays. Excluding the snout of the fish in the measurement helps circumvent the impact of highly variable snout lengths, as male salmon tend to develop distinct hooked snouts during maturation. The PSC sometimes uses POF to supplement stock identification information based on scales and DNA. POF is also used to track changes in length-at-age across return years.\nThe postorbital hypural (POH) length is the length from the posterior of the orbit to the hypural notch. This length measure is especially used during sampling on the spawning ground when the caudal fins tend to degrade, especially among females, causing the POF to become highly variable. Both the orbit and hypural north, used to determine the POH, can be identified on even highly degraded carcases. The PSC uses POH during sampling on spawning grounds as well as during in-river test fishery sampling. This allows comparing the POH of the test fishery samples against spawning ground samples.\nOther types of fish lengths include mid-eye fork length (MEF) and standard length. These lengths are generally not taken by the PSC but are entered into the PSC’s scale database when samples are received from other organizations. MEF is the length from the middle of the orbit to the fork in the tail. MEF length is generally taken in fishery samples by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. Standard length is the length from the tip of the snout to the hypural notch and is generally taken for spawning ground samples by Fisheries and Oceans Canada.\nSAMPLING DESIGN\nThere are five main types of biological data collected in the field by the PSC: fork length, POF, POH, weight, and sex. Tables 1 to 3 show which lengths are taken at each fishery, whether weights are taken, and the sample sizes for lengths and weights.\nFork lengths are generally only measured at the Whonnock gillnet test fishery and the Cottonwood gillnet test fishery. Fork lengths are measured for sockeye, pink, chum, Chinook, and unreleased (dead) coho salmon. Fork lengths are not measured for steelhead and released (live) coho. Forks lengths from Whonnock and Cottonwood are typically used within hydroacoustic length-based mixture models. If there are insufficient fork length samples available from Whonnock and Cottonwood, additional fork lengths data may be required from other test fisheries or commercial fisheries.\n95\n\fIn-season Assessments: Biological Information\nPostorbital fork (POF) lengths are measured at all PSC test fisheries and when commercial fisheries are sampled. POF is only measured for sockeye and pink salmon. For commercial fisheries and reef net test fisheries, sample sizes for length are determined by catch sizes and DNA sample requirements. Every fish sampled for DNA has an associated POF measurement unless the samplers are facing extreme time limitations at fish plants.\nPostorbital hypural (POH) lengths are the primary length measurements for spawning grounds samples. At the Cottonwood and Whonnock test fisheries, POH is measured for all sampled sockeye, adipose- clipped Chinook, and coho salmon. At Whonnock, POH lengths are also measured for pink salmon.\nWeights of individual fish are measured only for sockeye and pink salmon and only at the Cottonwood, Whonnock, Area 20 GN, Area 20 PS, Area 4B/5 GN, Qualark GN, and Area 7 RN test fisheries. Individual weights are also measured for commercial fishery samples. Weights are not measured for individuals that are incomplete such as fish that are damaged by seals or dressed. For commercial samples, individual weights may not be measured if time is a limiting factor. Bulk weights, which is the net weight of a tote, may also be recorded and are used to calculate the average weight. For Chinook, chum, and coho caught at test fisheries, only bulk weights are recorded when the fish are sold.\nSexes are recorded for all sampled sockeye and pink salmon whenever possible. For commercial samples, sexes may not be determined if time is limiting.\nTable 1. Sockeye sampling summary by fishery. The types of lengths taken at each fishery are shown as well as whether weights are taken and the sample size of each.\nFishery Cottonwood GN Whonnock GN Area 20 GN Area 20 PS Area 12 GN Area 12 PS Area 13 PS Area 4B/5 GN Qualark GN Gulf Troll Area 7 RN Albion GN Commercial Spawning Grounds\nLength type FL/POF/POH FL/POF/POH POF POF POF POF POF POF POF POF POF POF POF POH\nWeight Yes Yes 2 days/week 2 days/week No No No Yes Yes No Yes No Yes No\nSample Size (up to) 50/day 50/day 115/day 115/day 115/day 115/day 115/day 100/day 50/day 115/boat/day Variable All fish Variable Variable\n96\n\fIn-season Assessments: Biological Information\nTable 2.

The posts are 6-7cm long and generally have a fine-pointed tip. The accuracy of POF sticks is tested by setting the POF stick measurement to 50cm, then measuring from the inner edge of the fixed post to the point of the sliding post using measuring tape or another ruler (Figure 2). Lengths are recorded in centimeters or millimeters and are rounded to the nearest millimeter.\nFigure 2. A POF stick and how it can be used to measure lengths. Lengths are measured from the front of the fixed post to the point of the sliding post\nFork lengths are measured by placing the inner end of the fixed post of the POF stick in front of the fish snout and moving the point of the sliding post to the fork in the tail. Fork length is not measured if damage to the snout or tail prevents an accurate reading.\n97\n\fIn-season Assessments: Biological Information\nPostorbital fork (POF) lengths are measured by placing the fixed post of the POF stick into one of the eye sockets of the fish. The point of the sliding post is then moved to the fork in the tail. POF lengths are not taken if damage to the eye sockets or tail prevents an accurate reading.\nPostorbital hypural (POH) lengths can be measured in three different ways. For the first method, the flesh covering the hypural plate is cut away with a knife to reveal the hypural notch. The fixed post of the POF stick is then inserted into the eye socket and the sliding post is pointed at the hypural notch. This is the preferred method for spawning grounds sampling as it is the most accurate. For the second method, the sampler feels the tail of the fish to estimate the location of the hypural notch. The hypural plate is distinctly elevated at the base of the caudal fin rays. The measurement is taken from the eye socket to the estimated position of the hypural notch. This method is preferred for test fishery sampling as it is the most time-efficient and does not damage the fish and reduce retail value. The third method involves folding over the rays of the caudal fin until it can no longer be bent. The measurement can then be taken from the eye socket to the position of the final bend. This method is another time-efficient alternative to the first method but is less accurate.\nWeights are measured using a Kilotech industrial dial scale or an AND SK-WP digital scale. Scales are calibrated using two known weights: 1.390kg and 3.915kg. Weights are recorded either in pounds or kilograms and are always rounded to one decimal place. Average weight is calculated by dividing the total weight of fish in a sample by the sample size. If bulk weight was recorded, the average is calculated by dividing the net weight of a tote by the number of fish in it.\nTo determine the sex of a fish, a cut is made in the belly approximately two inches long from between where the pectoral fins originate and along the midline of the stomach. The sampler inserts their finger into the cut until the spine is reached, feeling along the outside of the internal organs. If the fish is female, the lumpy texture of the egg-filled ovaries can be felt. If the fish is male, the smooth testes can be felt. If the sampler is inexperienced or if the sex is indistinguishable by feel, the cut in the belly can be extended further to the posterior and the body cavity opened for a visual examination. For spawning grounds samples, the sex can be determined by visual examination of exterior morphology, but the body cavities of females are still examined to evaluate egg deposition or success of spawn.\nPlanned Changes and Potential Areas for Improvement Erroneous or anomalous length and weight measurements can enter the database unnoticed despite some existing preventative measures. An error-checking tool is under development to detect outliers in length-weight data so errors can be caught and rectified earlier. If the source of an error cannot be identified or if it can’t be fixed, anomalous data can be flagged and subsequently excluded from analysis if desired. Obvious errors can be removed, such as when fork lengths are shorter than POF lengths. The tool can also track data accuracy by fishery, allowing fishery-specific sources of errors to be addressed.\n98\n\fIn-season Assessments: Biological Information\nB7. In-Season Scale and Age Reading Methods\nJ.E. Sellars and M.R. Forrest\nSummary Fraser sockeye salmon stocks are managed by four management groups: Early Stuart, Early Summer run, Summer run and Late run. This stipulation within the Pacific Salmon Treaty requires salmon run size, catches and escapement estimates to be split into these four groups using stock composition estimates. In-season, stock composition estimates are derived from catch samples through scale reading i.e., by analysing scale characteristics and growth patterns and comparing the resulting patterns against the patterns of salmon with known stock origin. While DNA-based stock identification (Chapter B9) replaced scale-based methods as the primary method in 2002, scale-based methods still have an important role in the assessment for Fraser River sockeye salmon: they provide stock-ID information earlier and when DNA estimates are not available and they provide additional information to refine DNA-based stock proportions. In addition to providing stock-ID data, scales are the primary method to assess fish age. Since the majority of Fraser sockeye return as four-year olds, the portion of age four compared to age five sockeye is an important indicator to evaluate the strength of the sockeye run in relation to the strength of the run in the previous year. High age five proportions in- season may indicate that returns are less favorable than the previous year.\nIntroduction It was Dr. C.H. Gilbert, who in the early 1900s, first recognized that the freshwater scale patterns of Fraser River sockeye salmon stocks differ (Henry 1961) as they reflect unique variations in growth patterns that develop while stocks are spatially isolated, such as during juvenile residence in lakes or streams, or during certain phases of marine residence (Gable and Cox-Rogers 1993). In addition, it is also possible that genetic differences between stocks play a role in observed scale pattern differences (Gable and Cox-Rogers 1993).\nSockeye salmon scales contain a permanent record of the life history of a fish beginning with the early fry stage. As the fish grow in body size, corresponding radial scale growth takes place. New basal plates are formed under existing plates and hyalodentine ridges (circuli) are deposited on the margins between adjoining plates. The circuli appear under magnification as partially concentric rings which radiate outward from the scale focus (Figure 1, Gable and Cox-Rogers 1993). Widely spaced bands of circuli reflect rapid growth in the summer, and compactly spaced bands of circuli growth reflect growth in the winter (Bilton and Ludwig 1966). Scales contain two distinct zones of scale growth: the freshwater zone, consisting of thin, narrowly spaced circuli, and an outer marine zone, consisting of thick, widely spaced circuli (Figure 1). A third zone lies between the freshwater and marine scale zone. This is the “spring growth” or “plus-growth” zone. Circuli in this zone are of intermediate size and form just prior to, or soon after, ocean entry. Circuli counts in the freshwater and spring growth zones as well as distance measures within these zones are used by the PSC for stock identification and to evaluate the rate of growth in freshwater in a given year.\n99\n\fIn-season Assessments: Biological Information\nVentral\nSecond marine annulus\nFirst marine annulus\nDorsal\nFreshwater annulus\nAnterior\nPosterior\nFigure 1. Scale image with labels and radial line along which circuli counts are made.\nData In-season scale samples are collected regularly from test fisheries, and opportunistically from commercial fisheries as fisheries occur. For each sockeye sampled, one scale is collected, stored in a scale book and shipped to the Pacific Salmon Commission (PSC) Secretariat office. The PSC scale lab reads the scales and archives the associated information in a database together with other relevant information collected during the sampling process. The associated metadata can be used to match scale information of individual fish with DNA results as well as biological and fisheries information collected in the field. The PSC scale database contains records dating back to 1912. Initially only spawning ground scale samples were represented but since 1977 commercial and test fishing scale samples have also been collected and stored in the database. In addition to the adult scale information, the database also contains smolt scale information from 1948 to present. Since 1991, the lab analyses between 15,000- 51,000 sockeye scales annually, both for freshwater growth patterns as well as age.\nMethods Scales are forwarded to the PSC scale lab from multiple temporal and spatial locations in scale books. Each scale is removed from the scale book and cleaned before mounting onto a gummi card. Heat and pressure using a hydraulic press are used to make an impression of the scales on to a clear sheet of acetate. It is the microscopic image of the scale impression on the acetate that is used for scale aging and analysis. Using a microscope connected to a camera and computer, the image of the scale is captured, stored and analyzed using Image-pro premier software and the resulting scale measurements are stored in an Excel spreadsheet (Batchelor 2016).\nUsing expertise and experience, in combination with the image software, the scale analyst will examine and document the condition of the scale using condition codes (Table 1) and documents the circuli count of the freshwater growth zone, the spring growth count, the diameter of the focus, the distance from the focus to the fifth circuli, the distance from the focus to the annulus and the age. Circuli counts are made along a specific radial line for consistency of results (Figure 1), chosen to be the ventral 20o radial line (Clutter and Whitesel 1956). This line extends ventro-anteriorly from the focus of the scale,\n100\n\fIn-season Assessments: Biological Information\nforming an angle of 20o with the horizontal or longitudinal axis of the scale and is disclosed by overlaying the transmitted scale image with a grid onto which a longitudinal axis and two 20o radial lines have been etched. The circulus count is then made along the ventral 20o radial line.\nTable 1. Condition codes used to describe scale condition and available information.\nSockeye have multiple age classes (Table 2) and the PSC uses the Gilbert and Rich nomenclature for age classification (Clutter and Whitesel 1956). The first number denotes the age at spawning and a subscript or second number denotes the age at which the sockeye migrated to sea. For example, a 42 aged sockeye returns to its natal stream to spawn and die at four years of age. It has spent one year in the lake, migrated to sea in its second year of life and returned to its natal stream after 2 years at sea. The scales of the sockeye are aged by examining the number of annuli in the freshwater zone and the number of annuli in the marine zone For Fraser sockeye, the majority of the adult salmon will be 42 and 52 fish.\n101\nCCScale info availableScale ConditionREADABLE1AGE & CCREADABLE2AGE & CCRESORBED SCALE - Age questionable3AGE BUT NO CCAGEABLE BUT CC UNREADABLE4AGE & CCAGE BASED ON SCALE NOT OTOLITHUNREADABLE5NO AGE OR CCLATERAL LINE6NO AGE OR CCNON-SOCKEYE7NO AGE OR CCUNREADABLE8NO AGE OR CCMISSING9NO AGE OR CCREGENERATED10FW AGESOCKEYE THAT HAS MATURED IN FRESHWATERREADABLE12AGE & CC1/3 is good and the rest is resorbed 2-3 circuliOR2/3 is good but 1/3 is resorbed and into the last annulusREADABLE13AGE & CCGrowth to 1st Marine is small in comparison to the growth to the 2nd Marine - ie.

The scale data is then merged with the field and sample data within an Excel application that allows for data entry, data merging, error checking and summarising data. As an error checking tool, it highlights missing data, outliers, data that does not fall within specific boundaries and unusual data. Once the data have been merged and error checked, a second scale analyst will re-age and check a large proportion of the scales. This is another step to ensure aging accuracy, but also to ensure scale interpretation remains consistent between analysts. Analysts must be experienced and well-trained in aging to differentiate true annuli from stresses and false checks. The data are then summarized and uploaded into the scale database for use by the stock identification biologists (Chapter B8).\nReferences Batchelor, M.M. 2016.

Stock Composition Estimates Based on Scale Pattern Analyses\nP. Samarasin and S. Latham\nSummary Returning Fraser River sockeye stocks differ in timing and are aggregated into “management groups” to facilitate their management. Assessments in support of management therefore require stock composition information. The stock composition of mixed stock fishery samples can be estimated by comparing the scales from these samples against scale patterns from fish with known stock origin (i.e., scales collected at spawning grounds). Until 2002, scale-based methods were the primary mode of stock identification for Fraser River sockeye salmon. Within the current assessment framework, stock composition estimates derived through scale pattern analyses provide additional information to refine DNA-based stock proportions (Chapter B9) or provide estimates when DNA-based stock identification is not available. Although scale pattern analyses have been used for the last 50 years, the statistical approach has changed over time. This report provides a summary of historical and current (2018) approaches for scale pattern analysis for identification of Fraser River sockeye salmon stocks. The current scale pattern analysis method is a combination of two multivariate statistical methods – linear discriminant analysis (LDA) with principal components analysis (PCA). Scale pattern data from spawning ground samples are used to develop discriminant functions for separating Fraser River sockeye stocks, and the derived functions are applied to in-season scale samples from mixed-stock fisheries to estimate sample stock proportions. The model output provides stock proportions for the sample and stock assignment probabilities for individual sockeye salmon.\nIntroduction The recognition of differences in scale characteristics among different sockeye salmon stocks is attributed to Gilbert (1914-1925). However, use of scales to identify Fraser River sockeye stocks was first examined in the mid-1900s by Hamilton (1947) and Clutter and Whitesel (1956). At that time, the analysis used number of circuli in the freshwater zone of the scale to distinguish between stocks within the Fraser River watershed. Fraser River sockeye typically spend their first year in freshwater where they can differ considerably in their growth rates. Growth rates depend on freshwater conditions, and rearing lakes differ in temperature, food availability, and other factors that affect growth. Fish growth is closely related to scale growth (Clutter and Whitesel 1956), and growth is recorded in the scales which can be used to infer the origin of returning adult fish. There is variation in growth rate from year to year, however, resulting in differences in scale characteristics for any given stock among years. The stock composition of a mixed-stock fishery can be estimated by comparing growth patterns in a sample of scales from caught fish to growth patterns of fish with known stock origin (scales collected at spawning grounds). Here, the sample refers to a collection of scales removed by fisheries observers for determining the stock composition of the catch.\nData Sockeye salmon scales (one per fish) collected from fisheries and spawning grounds are read by PSC scale analysts who determine each salmon’s age and measure scale characteristics (see Chapter B7). The\n103\n\fIn-season Assessments: Biological Information\nfollowing scale variables are directly measured or calculated by scale analysts and are used in the statistical model to estimate stock composition: first count (count of circuli to the 1st freshwater annulus), plus or “spring” growth (circulus count between the freshwater annulus and marine growth), measured distances from the center to annulus, from the center to the 5th circulus, from the 1st circulus to the annulus, from the 1st to 5th circulus, and the adjusted center width. For generating discriminant functions: spawning ground scales with readable freshwater zones and known ages (from otoliths) are used. Only readable scales are included in mixtures for scale pattern analysis, and these may include or exclude individuals with resorption of their scales that would tend to underestimate the true age.\nMethods Scale pattern analysis methods have changed over time as statistical methods and implementation have evolved with increasing computation power. Two Pacific Salmon Commission (PSC) technical reports outline the use of scale pattern analysis for identification of Fraser River sockeye salmon stocks. First, Henry (1961) documented the univariate scale pattern analysis procedure for the identification of Fraser River sockeye stocks. This method used the number of freshwater circuli to estimate stock composition of the sample. Historical timing differences among major stock groups and the presence of plus growth were used to refine estimates but were not formally incorporated in the method. However, this method was not adequate when there were more than four stocks in the sample and only performed well in very simple situations. From the late 1970s onwards, PSC staff investigated multivariate methods to distinguish Fraser River sockeye stocks. In 1987, Henry’s univariate method was replaced by a multivariate discriminant analysis method. Gable and Cox-Rogers (1993) documented this multivariate discriminant analysis, which used first count, plus growth, and distance from 1st circulus to the freshwater annulus to discriminate among stocks. Stocks expected to be present more than 5% in a given statistical area during a given catch were included in the discriminant function analysis model and the expected presence was predicted based on in-season timing abundance curves, historical timing data, and forecasted run sizes. From 1987-2001, this multivariate scale pattern analysis was the primary in-season method of stock identification for Fraser River sockeye salmon. DNA-based stock composition estimation (Chapter B9) became the main method of stock identification in 2002 but scale-based estimates were still frequently used. From 2009 to 2017, scale-based stock compositions were infrequently incorporated into accounting files except when suitable DNA-based results were not available. For each stock, the discriminant function was based on scale standards obtained from spawning ground samples of the same cohort that returned a year earlier (i.e., age 32 samples were used for the age 42 model and age 42 samples were used for the age 52 model) and the samples from the previous year on the cycle (e.g., 2014 age 42 spawning ground samples for 2018 age 42 model). The resulting stock composition estimates from the discriminant analysis were further revised using a classification matrix correction procedure (Cook and Lord 1978) which employed misclassification rates of the spawning ground scales as determined during the development of discriminant function models. The current statistical approach for scale analysis (2018 onwards) generates stock assignment probabilities for individual scales (salmon) in the sample (see Table 1), and these probabilities are used to revise DNA-based stock composition estimates in a total weight of evidence approach (Chapter B9).\nThe current method is a combination of principal component analysis (PCA) and discriminant analysis (mainly linear discriminant analysis), where discriminant analysis is performed on principal component scores instead of scale variables directly. Principal component analysis allows information from all measured scale variables to be used in the discriminant analysis by creating synthetic variables (called principal components) that are linear combinations of the original variables. Discriminant analysis is a classification method that allows assignment of stock membership based on a set of independent variables extracted from non-independent trait measurements (the measured scale variables can be strongly correlated, so this procedure is necessary). As in the past, scale pattern analyses are conducted 104\n\fIn-season Assessments: Biological Information\nseparately for age 42 and age 52 sockeye salmon. For the age 42 model, spawning ground scales from age 42 individuals from 4 years prior and spawning ground scales from age 32 individuals from the previous year are used as scale standards (i.e., training data). For the age 52 model, spawning ground scales from age 42 individuals from the previous year are used as scale standards. Principal component analysis is performed first on scale variables and the principal component scores for the top five principal components are retained. A discriminant analysis is performed on principal component scores to generate discriminant functions from the training data (without incorporating the stock-specific sample sizes of the training data). Figure 1 illustrates the discriminant function space of 2018 age 42 summer- run Fraser River sockeye salmon spawning ground samples, which are training data for the 2022 age 42 scale model.\nOnce the discriminant function has been developed, it can be used to estimate stock assignment probabilities of in-season scale samples from various fisheries. Scale samples from in-season fisheries are read and a principal component analysis is performed first on the quantified scale variables. Principal component scores are retained and rotated similar to the training data. Next, discriminant analysis is performed to apply the previously developed discriminant functions to the in-season sample to generate stock assignment probabilities for individual scales in the sample (Table 1), and sample stock composition estimates (Table 2). Here, prior probabilities are obtained from the relative daily abundance forecast from the Fisheries Planning Model (Chapter A6). A stock composition estimate for age 42 and age 52 sockeye in the sample is estimated by assigning each scale to its highest probability stock (i.e., stock 1) and then applying the bias-correction procedure (Cook and Lord 1978, Table 2) to the results for each of these ages. A total estimate is obtained through a weighted sum of the stock composition across ages (including some ages for which no formal statistical model is run, e.g., Harrison age 31 and 41 scales).\n105\n\fIn-season Assessments: Biological Information\nFigure 1.

Latham\nSummary Fraser River sockeye fisheries are regulated at the level of stock aggregates (Early Stuart, Early Summer, Summer, and Late run) called management groups, making the identification of Fraser River sockeye salmon stocks a fundamental requirement for their assessment and management. Sockeye salmon is an excellent candidate for performing DNA-based stock identification because of strong natal fidelity, which has led to strong genetic differentiation over time. DNA-based stock identification has been regularly used by the Pacific Salmon Commission (PSC) since 2002. Prior to 2002, scale-based stock identification methods were the primary means of stock identification. Genetic stock identification (GSI) involves extraction of DNA from tissue samples collected following fisheries and generation of a multi-locus genetic profile. Genetic profiles from fishery catches of unknown stock composition are subsequently compared against a genetic baseline with known stock origin using, in our case, the Bayesian framework as implemented by the CBayes stock identification program. CBayes generates stock assignment probabilities for individual fish in a sample and summarizes the overall stock composition for the sample. In-season, stock identification results are used to determine stock- specific catch estimates as well as stock-specific estimates of upstream migration (Chapter B17). As such, genetic stock identification results are essential for stock-specific reconstructions to assess the total run size and timing by management group (Chapter B18).\nIntroduction In accordance with the Pacific Salmon Treaty (PST 2020, Chapter 4, section 3), Fraser River sockeye salmon are managed as four management groups, with each management group consisting of one or more stocks (Table 1). The membership of stocks among management groups is determined by their relative migration timing, and not based on spawning ground location (Figure 1). For example, the Early Summer-run management group contains stocks such as Pitt River sockeye and Nadina River sockeye with spawning grounds that are about 1000 km apart, whereas other stocks that are spatially closer to these stocks belong to different management groups, e.g., the Stellako stock which is spatially proximal to Nadina is part of Summer-run management group. Consequently, stocks within a management group may experience very different migration difficulties and spawning conditions as adults and freshwater rearing conditions as juveniles. This may result in very different survival and productivity estimates for individual stocks within a management group, requiring assessments at finer stock resolutions in addition to assessment at the management group level. Therefore, high resolution stock identification is a key component of in-season Fraser River sockeye salmon assessments.\nUntil 2002, scale-based analyses of mixed-stock fisheries samples (Chapter B8) was the primary means of Fraser River sockeye stock identification. Even though the PSC’s use of DNA to identify stocks is relatively new, underlying population genetic principles for conducting genetic stock identification (GSI) have been well established for decades. DNA-based GSI of other fish and wildlife, using the same principles, have been conducted since the early 1990s (e.g., van de Ven et al. 1990).\nSockeye salmon populations are excellent candidates for application of DNA-based GSI methods because of the strong degree of natal fidelity and local adaptation exhibited by the species, leading to genetic differentiation among populations over time (Taylor 1991, Quinn 2005, Keefer and Caudill 2014). 109\n\fIn-season Assessments: Biological Information\nThe level of genetic differentiation among stocks of interest is the most important determinant of the success of DNA-based stock identification methods. If genetic differentiation among stocks of interest is high, GSI methods can easily determine the origin of each fish in a mixed-stock fishery sample (Araujo et al. 2014). Levels of genetic differentiation between sockeye salmon stocks in the Fraser River and nearby areas have been studied and shown to be significant among most stocks of interest (Beacham et al. 2004, Beacham et al. 2010). Thus, GSI for estimating Fraser River sockeye salmon stocks in marine and in-river fisheries gained prominence over time as the scientific basis, accuracy, and reliability of these methods was demonstrated.\nFigure 1. Spatial location of 27 Fraser River sockeye salmon stocks, which are aggregated into four management groups, i.e., Early Stuart, Early Summer, Summer, and Late run).\n110\n\fIn-season Assessments: Biological Information\nTable 1.

The baseline or reference samples comprise\n111\n\fIn-season Assessments: Biological Information\ntissues collected from salmon of known stock origin on the spawning grounds; samples of unknown origin, which get compared to the baseline, are collected from various fisheries. Further details of the DNA sampling procedure can be found in Chapter B5. Collected tissue samples are sent to the Molecular Genetics Laboratory at the Pacific Biological Station (Fisheries and Oceans Canada, Nanaimo, BC) where DNA is extracted, loci of interest are amplified through polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and genotypes are estimated at 14 microsatellite loci (Beacham 2004) and five single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci (Beacham 2010). The resulting multi-locus genotypes constitute the genetic profiles of individual sockeye salmon that are used for further GSI analyses.\nMethods At a conceptual level, GSI analyses are similar to scale-based stock composition analyses. Both methods compare some characteristics of sockeye of unknown origin against characteristics of salmon with known origin to estimate the stock composition of the unknown sample. In scale pattern analyses, scale characteristics are compared, whereas GSI compares allelic frequencies to infer stocks of origin. Genotypes of fish from spawning ground locations have been collected over years and serve as reference data or genetic baseline to assign individuals of unknown origin to a stock by determining how similar their observed genetic profiles are to different baseline samples. The genetic baseline for Fraser River Panel sockeye analyses includes 50 Fraser River stocks, organized into 19 reported stock groups (Table 1), and 37 non-Fraser stocks. First, individuals in a mixed-stock fishery sample are assigned to their stocks of origin by calculating the probability of the individuals originating from different spawning ground locations (Table 2). Once all individuals are assigned to stocks of origin with corresponding probabilities, these assignment probabilities are summed to calculate the stock composition of the entire sample (Table 3). Up to 100 individuals are usually analyzed simultaneously to estimate the stock composition of a sample. Individuals with eight or more missing loci are excluded from the analysis.\nTable 2.

This program analyzes stock mixtures by implementing a Bayesian model described in detail by Pella & Masuda (2001). Compared to maximum likelihood methods of estimating stock composition such as SPAM (Debevec et al. 2000), this Bayesian mixture model has more relaxed model assumptions and more flexibility to deal with incomplete genotypes when some loci are not successfully amplified by PCR and cannot be scored. Pella and Masuda’s (2001) Bayesian mixture model r treats baseline genotypes as a sample, rather than a population parameter that is known precisely, relaxing the need to have very large baseline sample sizes that are truly representative of the population of interest. Genotypes found in the mixture can also be used to update allele frequency estimates in the baseline sample. Furthermore, this method better addresses the problem of underestimating more abundant stocks and overestimating rare stocks (Pella & Masuda 2001). The Fraser River Panel transitioned from using SPAM estimates to using Cbayes estimates between 2008 and 2011, during which all previous years’ sockeye DNA samples were re-analyzed with Cbayes.\nWhen running Cbayes, the Gelman-Rubin diagnostic is used to assess convergence of ten independent Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) chains. This diagnostic helps determine if the probability space is explored adequately by the search algorithm and if sufficient MCMC samples are utilised when summarizing results. The raw stock composition results from the Cbayes program are corrected for small stock bias by reassigning stock estimates below a threshold determined by the sample size. This removes very small stock estimates that are based on fractions of an individual and reassigns that proportion estimate to the most frequent stock in the mixture. Next, for each individual, GSI results are\n113\n\fIn-season Assessments: Biological Information\naligned with the scale-based information and size data. If there is sufficient evidence from these additional pieces of information to indicate that the GSI result for an individual is inaccurate, the stock identification biologist adjusts the results based on expert integration of the combined evidence.\nEvaluation Research by Beacham and colleagues characterized the population genetic structure of Fraser River sockeye salmon (Withler et al. 2000, Beacham et al. 2004) and established the scientific basis for using DNA-based stock identification (Beacham et al. 2004, Beacham et al. 2006, Beacham et al. 2010). Beacham et al. (2004) examined inter and intra- population genetic variation for Fraser River sockeye populations, population genetic differentiation, power of individual loci used for analyses, and accuracy of stock composition estimates. Most Fraser River sockeye salmon populations of interest exhibit strong genetic differentiation from each other, and this facilitates successful GSI. The performance of various GSI methods has been evaluated in the scientific literature (e.g., Araujo et al. 2014, Brenden et al. 2015). At levels of genetic differentiation typical among Fraser River sockeye stocks, Araujo et al. (2014) found no significant difference in performance between CBayes and ONCOR (Kalinowski et al. 2007), a popular alternative GSI software program.\nPlanned Changes and Potential Areas for Improvement Additional work planned to be undertaken includes:\n\nExplore improving stock identification at the stock level for stocks that are relatively difficult to\n\ndistinguish, such as Late Stuart and Stellako.\n\nExplore the potential for distinguishing sub-stocks at the DNA baseline sample level (Table 1).\nEstablish methods for comparing the efficacy of GSI across sampling areas or conditions, e.g.,\n\nevaluate likelihoods of stocks of origin of individuals unaffected by stock compositions of other individuals in the same sample mixtures versus the most probable stock of origin identified by Cbayes.\nReferences Araujo, H.A., Candy, J.R., Beacham, T.D., White, B. and Wallace, C. 2014.

Xie\nSummary The PSC operates a hydroacoustic site near Mission, BC, that provides daily estimates of salmon passage in the Fraser River throughout the summer. When used in combination with daily species composition estimates (Chapter B16), these estimates contribute to in-season assessments by providing daily sockeye and pink salmon abundance information for run reconstructions (Chapter B18), adjustment of test fishery expansion lines (Chapter B4), prediction of en-route mortality to spawning grounds (Chapter B22), and estimates of Fraser pink salmon escapement. To sample the entire width of the river at the site, a configuration of multiple sonar systems is operated at the site, including two shore-based ARIS imaging sonars (Chapter B13), a side-looking split-beam (Chapter B11), and a mobile, downward looking split- beam system (Chapter B14). The cross-river location of each sonar and its observed fish targets are determined based on GPS coordinates and then input into a flux estimation model to determine the total daily salmon passage.\nIntroduction Accurate estimates of daily migration abundance are an integral component of in-season assessments of Fraser sockeye management groups. Hydroacoustic monitoring provides a non-invasive, continuous means of monitoring fish migration that is widely used by fisheries agencies for assessing salmon populations. The PSC (and its predecessor the IPFSC) have operated a hydroacoustics monitoring facility on the lower Fraser River every summer since 1977 to assess upstream passage of sockeye and pink salmon. By providing accurate and timely estimates of passage, information from the PSC hydroacoustics site contributes to in-season run reconstructions (Chapter B18) of Fraser sockeye and pink salmon runs, adjustments of test fishery expansion lines (Chapter B4), prediction of en route mortality using management adjustments (Chapter B22) and estimates of Fraser pink salmon escapement.\nThe PSC hydroacoustics site is located two kilometers upstream of the Mission Railway Bridge and approximately 80 kilometers from the mouth of the Fraser River (Figure 1). This location was originally selected because it is just above the commercial fishing boundary and almost all sockeye populations migrate past it on their upstream migration (with the exception of Pitt River and Widgeon sockeye). The river is approximately 400 meters wide at the site and influenced by tidal changes in water height.\n116\n\fIn-season Assessments: Hydroacoustic Information\nFigure 1. Map of the Lower Fraser River indicating the Mission hydroacoustics monitoring site.\nDue to the large channel width, a combination of three or more hydroacoustic systems are deployed to adequately monitor the salmon migration areas (Figure 2). The nearshore left bank area is monitored by a stationary split-beam system (Chapter B11) and an ARIS imaging sonar (Chapter B13) deployed at the end of a fish deflection weir. The ARIS system covers up to the first 30 meters while the split-beam system extends coverage by an additional 30-60meters. The left bank area is where most of the upstream migration typically occurs and is a key focus for monitoring efforts. The left bank ARIS system increases the accuracy of the left bank, especially during periods of high abundance when the split-beam system has been known to underestimate abundances. The nearshore right bank area is monitored using another ARIS imaging sonar and typically observes less than 20% of the daily upstream salmon migration. In addition to abundance information, the ARIS systems on both the left and right bank provide estimates of salmon species composition using a mixture model based on acoustically observed fish lengths (Chapter B16). The remaining offshore region is monitored by a mobile, downward-looking split-beam system deployed from a sampling vessel that transects the river (Chapter B14).\nTo produce a daily estimate of salmon passage, the data collected by each hydroacoustic system is processed, analyzed and input into a flux estimation model. This report describes the flux estimation model for estimating daily salmon passage from a configuration of multiple sonars at the site.\n117\nMissionHells GateFraser RiverHope\n\fIn-season Assessments: Hydroacoustic Information\nFigure 8. Cross-river view of the sampling geometry of the sonar systems operated at the Mission hydroacoustics site. The four systems shown are the left bank ARIS (A1, covering 0 to 30m), the left bank split-beam (S1, covering 0 to 50m), the mobile split-beam (M), and the right bank ARIS (A2, covering final 30m). The beam geometries of left bank ARIS (A1) are represented by the hollow triangles and overlap with the S1 beam geometries which are represented by the filled coloured triangles. The blue filled offshore area represents the cross-river region sampled by the mobile split-beam. The gray filled area represents the river bottom. Note that the cross-river range scale on the x-axis is compressed relative to the vertical depth scale on the y-axis.\nMethods To determine salmon passage across the entire river channel at the Mission hydroacoustics site, the passage estimates from the four monitoring systems (left bank ARIS, A1; left bank split-beam, S1; mobile split-beam, M; and right bank ARIS, A2) must be combined. To accomplish this, the cross-river width is divided into 5 meter range bins, then for each range bin, the salmon passage from a single monitoring system is applied. The range bins sampled by each system are determined from their GPS location along with their sampling range and compass bearing. These sampling areas are updated throughout the field season as the river levels drop and the systems are moved further offshore. The analysis of the positioning, selection, and addition of sonar system configurations for the daily estimate are completed using the Flux Estimator software developed by the PSC (Lagasse 2019).\nIf a range bin is sampled by multiple systems, only the most accurate system is used for the salmon passage estimate, while other estimates are excluded to avoid double-counting. Estimates from shore- based systems are preferentially used over mobile estimates whenever possible due to their higher sampling intensity and more accurate ability to track fish locations and behavior. Where multiple shore- based systems overlap in sampling area, as is the case with the left bank split-beam and ARIS, the split- beam is used for the daily estimate in most cases due to its ability to sample a greater portion of the water column and extrapolate into unsampled areas (Chapter B11). However, during periods of very high-density fish passage, such as the peak of the Fraser pink migration in 2019, the split-beam cannot accurately distinguish among fish tracks and may underestimate fish passage, so the left bank ARIS would be used instead to estimate nearshore salmon passage.\n118\n\fIn-season Assessments: Hydroacoustic Information\nThe distribution of salmon passage across the river channel tends to change throughout a season depending on river flows, species composition, tidal fluxes, and other factors. River flows and turbidity are higher in July than August or September, and a greater proportion of the migration occurs in the offshore areas observed by the mobile system. As flows decrease, the tidal influence on water heights increases and fish passage becomes more concentrated along the shorelines. During odd-numbered years when pink salmon return to the Fraser River, migration past the Mission hydroacoustics site is highly concentrated in near-shore areas, with less than 10% of daily passage observed in offshore regions.\nAll of the systems operated at the Mission hydroacoustics site sample throughout the day and night with the shore-based systems operating continuously for 24 hours a day. Therefore, assuming there are no gaps in data collection, each estimate of daily salmon passage is based on 24 hours of monitoring data. To group each day and night period into the same assessment interval, the daily estimates do not coincide with calendar days, but instead begin at 05:00 each day. For example, the estimate of daily salmon passage at Mission for July 4 would include data beginning at 05:00a.m. on July 4 and continuing to 04:59a.m. on July 5.\nData collected by each of the systems is reviewed and processed by 8:30a.m. every morning by PSC staff throughout the field season to generate the estimate of salmon passage for the previous day. Summary statistics are calculated for the daily estimate of salmon passage including the ratio of fish travelling downstream (S1 Ratio downstream, Rd), the proportion of daily passage observed by each sonar system, the percentage of passage extrapolated in unsampled areas (% Extrapolated), and the number of transects performed by the mobile sampling vessel and the number of daily targets observed by the mobile vessel (Table 1). The summary statistics also include total salmon estimates based on alternative system configurations (e.g., S1+M, A1+M+A2, S1+M+A2 and A1+S1+M+ A2). Once the daily estimate of total salmon passage is published, the species composition of salmon (Chapter B16) is estimated to determine the daily passage of sockeye salmon past Mission.\nTable 1.

Left Bank Salmon Passage Based on Shore- based Split-beam Sonar\nC.R. Lagasse and Y. Xie\nSummary A shore-based split-beam sonar deployed near the left bank of the Mission hydroacoustics site is a key component of the estimation system for salmon passage. Split-beam technology was first adopted for the Mission site in 2004 and has been operated continuously throughout the salmon monitoring period in all years since then. An hourly stratified sampling design is used for data collection, consisting of systematic spatial sampling of ten non-overlapping vertical areas up to a range of 60 metres offshore. The echo data is filtered, tracked, and classified to distinguish fish tracks from debris, bubbles and other noise. All data is then manually verified by PSC staff prior to estimating associated abundance by analysing a daily summary of fish tracks within the flux model (Chapter B12). The left-bank estimate typically accounts for more than half of the daily salmon passage at the Mission site.\nIntroduction Split-beam sonar is widely used for fisheries acoustics in riverine and marine applications around the world. By collecting information on the position within the sound-beam and signal strength of echoes, the technology allows fish to be tracked in 3-dimensional space, thereby providing a method for estimating fish passage in both upstream and downstream directions. Within the Fraser River, split- beam monitoring at the Mission site was first implemented in 2004 following recommendations from a hydroacoustics working group in 1994 and feasibility studies from 1995 to 2002 (Xie et al. 2005). Since 2004, a shore-based split-beam sonar has been operated from the left bank of the Mission site to continuously monitor fish migration in the river and contribute to daily estimates of salmon passage. This system is generally the most important component of the daily passage estimate because the majority of salmon migrate closer to the left bank of the site where water flows are weakest.\nTo estimate fish passage observed by the split-beam, the raw signal of echoes must be filtered, processed and verified to distinguish between fish and non-fish targets so that detected fish can be counted using a target-tracking method. Once the left bank split-beam data has been verified, key statistics of tracked fish, including their abundance and direction of travel, are imported into a flux model to determine the daily fish passage (Chapter B12). The PSC has developed and refined these procedures over time and performs them on a daily basis throughout the migration of sockeye and pink salmon within the Fraser River to provide real-time estimates of daily salmon passage for in-season management.\nMethods\nEQUIPMENT AND DEPLOYMENT\nAt the beginning of each field season, the PSC installs a sectional fish deflection weir (Enzenhofer et al. 2005) on the left bank of the river to allow deployment of its split-beam and imaging sonars (Figure 1), and to direct the movement of salmon past the sonar systems. The deflection weir is deployed up to a depth of approximately 4 meters and sections are added to extend the weir throughout the summer as\n121\n\fIn-season Assessments: Hydroacoustic Information\nriver levels drop. The split-beam system is attached to the weir using a U-bracket that allows its depth to be adjusted in the water column. Conduit poles installed along the entire length of the weir prevent fish from swimming behind or too close to the transducer.\nThe split-beam currently used by the PSC is manufactured by Hydroacoustics Technology Incorporated (HTI) and operates at a frequency of 200 kHz with an elliptical beam geometry of 2° × 10° effective beam height and width. The beam is oriented with its longer axis parallel to river flow to optimize fish detection. The transducer is powered by an HTI Model 243 echosounder that is stored in a trailer on shore. Once deployed, the split-beam system is operated continuously to collect data 24 hours a day throughout the field season.\nFigure 1. The fish deflection weir and deployed split-beam and ARIS imaging sonar on the left bank of the Mission site. The underwater position and orientation of the split-beam are indicated by the red square and arrow. A close-up view of the split-beam transducer are shown in the inset photo.\nThe elliptical beam geometry of the split-beam can only sample a small portion of the water column, therefore a stratified sampling design with multiple vertical aims is used for greater sampling coverage. The stratified sampling design consists of ten aims of non-overlapping, 2° vertical apertures with each aim sampling for 6 minutes each hour up to a range of 60 metres offshore (Figure 2). The vertical tilt and bearing of the transducer is controlled by a SIDUS SS250 rotator and monitored using an Impact Subsea ISD4000 motion reference unit, which also records the water height at the site where tidal influences can be very pronounced.\nDATA COLLECTION AND PROCESSING\nTo identify individual targets among the acoustic pings transmitted by the split-beam, the received echoes are first processed using a single-echo detection (SED) threshold that removes any targets below an acoustic target strength threshold of approximately -45 dB (Ehrenberg and Torkelson 1996). The target strength of adult salmon is normally greater than -40 dB, therefore the SED filters out most signals that are too weak and/or too narrow (relative to the projected pulse width) to have originated from a salmon. The SED filtered single-target data are analyzed using an alpha-beta tracker (Blackman\n122\n\fIn-season Assessments: Hydroacoustic Information\nand Popoli 1999) to form tracks of detected targets, following the targets over time in a three- dimensional space. An automated discriminant function analysis (DFA) is then applied to the target tracks to distinguish fish tracks from debris or other noise (Xie at al. 2012). In some cases, particularly during the peak migration of pink salmon, a DFA is not applied because it cannot distinguish dense schools of fish from noise.\nFollowing the automated fish track identification, the tracks are manually verified by trained staff that review the echogram data using the Split-beam Fishtrack graphic user interface editing software developed by the PSC (Figure 3). Targets are verified by examining the summary statistics of target track features such as speed, direction of travel, and target strength, as well as looking for broader patterns in the distribution of echoes in the water column. For example, bottom echoes can be visually identified and removed based on their very low speeds, clumped distributions and consistent sampling ranges. This processing and editing procedure is performed daily for every hour of split-beam data.\nThe verified fish tracks are then exported into a spreadsheet containing statistics on the target strength, number of pings, direction of travel, and the 3-dimensional location and speed for each of the individual verified fish tracks. These data are then imported into the PSC Flux Estimator software for further summary and analysis (Chapter B12). The flow chart in Figure 4 describes the steps of left bank split- beam data processing.\nFigure 2. Hourly sampling design of the left bank split-beam system (red square) with the ten vertical aims represented by coloured wedges. Each of the aims has a vertical height of 2°, resulting in a total coverage of 20° of the water column. The maximum sampling range is 60 meters, though many of the aims near the river boundaries use reduced ranges to avoid interference from the water surface or river bottom. The gray filled area represents the river bottom as profiled in July 2018.\n123\n\fIn-season Assessments: Hydroacoustic Information\nFigure 3.

Black dots represent noise such as surface bubbles or debris. These data represent a period of low fish passage on August 16, 2019.\nFigure 4. Flow chart describing the procedure for left bank split-beam data processing.\nPlanned Changes and Potential Areas for Improvement Over the last decade, the split-beam system on the left bank has relied on an HTI 2° × 10° transducer and Model 243 echosounder for data collection. In the near future, this equipment will need to be replaced. HTI has discontinued support for its echosounders requiring alternative suppliers to be explored. An ARIS sonar has been in use on the left bank since 2017 (Chapter B13) and research is currently on-going\n124\n\fIn-season Assessments: Hydroacoustic Information\nto compare the fish passage estimates between the ARIS and split-beam systems and to eventually phase out the split-beam system.\nReferences Blackman, S.S., and Popoli, R. 1999.

Xie and PSC Hydroacoustics Staff\nSummary Fish passage in the Fraser River in the left-bank nearshore area at Mission is monitored with a multi-aimed split-beam sonar (Chapter B11). Sounding ranges at steeper (either upper or lower) aims are significantly shortened to avoid echoes from the river bottom and water’s surface. While fish passage in the ensonified zone can be directly estimated, passage in the acoustic blind zones is projected from observed passage values using a nearest-neighbour extrapolation algorithm.\nIntroduction Fish passage in nearshore areas, up to 60m from either bank, is monitored by shore-based side-looking sonar systems. On the right bank, the bottom of the nearshore area is generally concave. This allows an ARIS with a single vertical aim with a beam-width of 15o, to effectively sample the entire water column for the nearshore area on the right bank (Figure 1).\nFigure 1. Sampling ranges for the left and right banks nearshore areas. The left-bank split-beam system (LB.S1) uses 10-aim stratified unequal ranges to sample the nearshore water column. The right-bank ARIS system (RB.A2) uses a single-aim to sample the nearshore water column (out to 40m).\nOn the left-bank, the bottom of the nearshore area is convex. This area therefore requires stratified sampling of fish passage in the left-bank nearshore area with a split-beam system on a rotator allowing for stratified sampling at 10 aims. The multiple aims allow flexibility in sampling different portions of the water column with optimal sounding ranges. Sounding ranges at upper or lower aims are significantly shortened to avoid echoes from river boundaries (i.e. the river bottom and water’s surface). However, the differential sounding ranges for different aims can result in acoustic blind zones near the river surface and bottom. While fish passage in the ensonified zone can be directly estimated (Chapter B11), passage in the blind zone is projected from observed flux values using a nearest-neighbour extrapolation algorithm (Bowman and Azzalini 1997).\n126\n\fIn-season Assessments: Hydroacoustic Information\nMethods\nDATA COLLECTION\nThe left-bank split-beam system is deployed at the end of a fish deflection fence as shown in Figure 2. The 2o × 10o split-beam transducer uses an hourly systematic sampling scheme to sample the nearshore water column at 10 non-overlapping aims with a sampling time of 6 minutes per aim (see Chapter B11 for details). After a 24-hour sampling period, the system obtains a cumulative distribution for the nearshore fish passage as shown in Figure 3.\nFigure 2. The fish deflection weir and deployed split-beam system on the left bank of the Mission site. The underwater position and orientation of the split-beam sonar are indicated by the red square and arrow.\nFigure 3. Cumulative fish distribution (black dots) over a 24-hour sampling period by the left-bank split-beam system. For the monitored nearshore area (within the 2 vertical black lines), there are areas not ensonified by the sound-beam. Fish passage through these blind zones is estimated by the nearest-neighbour method.\n127\n\fIn-season Assessments: Hydroacoustic Information\nREPRESENTATION OF LEFT-BANK NEARSHORE CROSS-SECTION WITH FINITE CELLS\nTo estimate the total abundance of fish in the left-bank nearshore cross-section, the area is represented by 2 dimensional cells, each 5m wide and 1m high (Xie 2002), as shown in Figure 4. Note that in these cross-section plots the river bottom is the vertical reference (y = 0) so that the flat surface of the mean waterline is transformed to a curvy line (the red line) which mirrors the river bottom. Based on the proportion of the cell ensonified and the proportion of the cell under water, cells are classified into 5 classes:\n\nFully ensonified and fully submerged cells (e.g. cells indicated by the black arrows in Fig. 4);\nPartially ensonified and fully submerged cells with coverage &gt;50% (e.g. cells indicated by the\n\ngreen arrows in Fig. 4);\n\nPartially ensonified and fully submerged cells with coverage &lt;50% (e.g. cells indicated by the\n\nblue arrows in Fig. 4);\n\nPartially submerged cells (e.g. cells indicated by the pink arrows in Fig. 4);\nCells completely above the waterline (e.g. cells indicated by the purple arrows in Fig. 4).\n\nFigure 4. Classifications of 2 dimensional cells by the proportions ensonified and submerged. A total of 5 classes are identified, examples of which are shown by arrows of different colors (see text for details). Values in individual cells are estimates of hourly fish flux through the cells (see next section for details).\nCALCULATIONS OF HOURLY FISH FLUX THROUGH INDIVIDUAL CELLS\nThe hourly fish flux, i.e. the number of fish per hour, is calculated using different methods for the 5 classes of cells, as outlined below.\nFor fully ensonified cells that are fully submerged in the water (type 1), the hourly fish flux (f) is calculated by a linear expansion of the number of fish observed daily in the cell (N) divided by the total daily sampling minutes (T):\n\n\n\n𝑓1 =\n𝑁 𝑇\n× 60.\n128\n\fIn-season Assessments: Hydroacoustic Information\nFor cells that are fully submerged and ensonified for more than 50% (type 2), the hourly flux f is calculated the same way, except that an area expansion factor (1/α with α being the ensonified proportion of the cell area) is applied to equation 1 to expand the observed flux to the entire area of the cell:\n\n\n\n𝑁 𝑓2 = ( 𝑇\n× 60 ) /𝛼.\nFor instance, if the sound-beam ensonifies 75% of the cell area, then the expansion factor would be 1/0.75 = 1.33 .\nFor cells that are fully submerged and ensonified for less than 50% (type 3), we consider the observed area to be too small to expand the observed flux to the entire cell area. Instead, the flux in the area that is not ensonified is based on the flux in the nearest-neighbour cell, by taking the mean of the estimated flux in the horizontally (fh), vertically (fv) and diagonally (fd) neighbouring cells. The total flux for this class of cells is then:\n\n\n\n𝑓3 = 𝑓1 + (1 − 𝛼) ∙ (\n𝑓ℎ+𝑓𝑣+𝑓𝑑 3\n)\nwith 𝛼 indicating the ensonified proportion of the cell area and (1-𝛼) indicating the area for which the nearest-neighbour method is used to derive the hourly flux. Taking the cell with the flux value of 542.72 (fish/hour) in Figure 4 as an example, we demonstrate the application of Equation 3 to this partially ensonified cell. In this example, the ensonified proportion for the area of this cell is 33% and the flux in this area is 237 fish/hour. The nearest neighbour method projects a flux of 456.3 = (569.17 + 343.37+ 360.83)/3 (fish/hour). Therefore, the flux for this cell is, according to Equation 3: 𝑓3 = 237 + (1 − 0.33) × 456.3 = 542.7 fish/hour.\nFor cells not fully submerged in the water (type 4), the estimated flux for a entire cell produced by the above calculations must be reduced by a factor of β, the submerged portion of the cell:\n\n\n\n𝑓4 = 𝛽 ∙ 𝑓.\nTaking the cell with the flux value of 402.89 fish/hour in Figure 3 as an example, we estimate the flux for this cell based on the nearest-neighbour method to be 469.3 = (295.9 + 542.72 + 569.17) / 3 fish/hour, assuming the cell is fully submerged. However, this cell is only 85.8% submerged; therefore, the flux for this cell according to Equation 4 is: 𝑓4 =0.858 × 469.3 = 403 fish/hour. The fish flux for cells entirely above the waterline (type 5) is zero.\nFLUX ESTIMATOR SOFTWARE\nThe representation of the left-bank cross section by 5m × 1m cells and the above calculations of ensonified and submerged proportions of individual cells are implemented by the Visual C++ based software program, FluxEstimator. The software includes a graphical user interface (GUI) system to allow the user to visually examine the outputs of flux values for individual cells. Users can use the GUI to over- rule extrapolated flux for individual cells if the flux values appear either too high or too low relative to the neighbouring cells’ values. However, in most data scenarios, the flux outputs are not altered.\nThe FluxEstimator graphs are presented in Figure 5. The top graph shows the upstream fish targets while the bottom graph show targets that move downstream. In this example, the net upstream flux (upstream flux – downstream flux) in the ensonified area is 4039.6 fish/hour. The fish flux in the blind zones is calculated using the methods described in the previous section (Xie et al. 2005). In this example, the net upstream hourly flux through the entire left-bank monitoring area is 5297.33 fish/hour. In this scenario, the extrapolated flux accounts for 23.7% of the total estimated flux.\n129\n\fIn-season Assessments: Hydroacoustic Information\nFigure 5.

Bartel Sawatzky\nSummary Imaging sonar technology such as DIDSON and ARIS systems provides visually intuitive data that are currently used by fisheries biologists to estimate salmon escapement and species composition in the Fraser River. This technology has been utilized officially at the Pacific Salmon Commission’s Mission hydroacoustics monitoring site since 2009. This document outlines the deployment, sampling design, and fish counting methods for the imaging data generated by the Sound Metrics ARIS 1800 system as it is currently used in the hydroacoustics program.\nIntroduction The Pacific Salmon Commission (PSC) hydroacoustics program has been enumerating upstream salmon passage through the lower Fraser River at Mission since 1977. Over the years, various new technologies have been tested and adopted to improve the accuracy of salmon passage estimates. The program started with a single-beam sonar system and a split-beam system was added to the program in 2004. These systems however did not allow to visually identify the objects passing the monitoring site, which can cause problems when there is a lot of debris in the river or during periods of very dense upstream migration. In 2001, acousticians and sonar engineers from the University of Washington developed a high-resolution image sonar system that allow users to visually identify detailed shapes of underwater objects. The sharp resolution and the ease of use and interpretation of the image information make imaging sonar one of the best tools for observing fish behaviour in a turbid riverine environment such as the lower Fraser River at Mission, B.C.\nImaging sonar technology has been utilized in the PSC hydroacoustics program since 2004, beginning with trials of the DIDSON system (Dual-Frequency Identification Sonar, Belcher et al. 2002) to assess its ability to estimate fish flux in areas ensonified by the left bank split-beam system (Chapter B11). These trials also assessed the DIDSON system for the purposes of estimating fish flux in blind zones of the left bank split-beam system, identifying non-salmonid fish targets and obtaining statistics on fish behaviour (Xie et al. 2005). After the successful completion of these trials, the DIDSON system was officially integrated into the PSC hydroacoustics program in the summer of 2009 to monitor upstream salmon passage (Lagasse et al. 2017).\nInitial experiments with an ARIS 1800 system were conducted during the 2015 field season to compare its data to the data collected by the DIDSON and 2° x 10° split-beam transducer deployed from the left bank of the Mission hydroacoustic site. This comparison revealed that the ARIS, with its increased resolution, produced similar counts to the DIDSON at close range on the left bank (Lagasse et al. 2016). Similar comparisons of the ARIS and DIDSON imaging sonar systems continued for the 2016 field season, this time with the two units sampling the same portion of the water column. This further testing showed that the ARIS and DISON systems produced statistically identical results of fish passage (Lagasse et al. 2017).\nCurrently, the ARIS imaging sonar systems are deployed on both the right and left banks, capturing approximately 60-80% of the total daily salmon passage at the Mission site (Conrad et al. 2019). While testing is underway to also employ the ARIS on the vessel transecting the mid-section of the river, the current document focuses on the ARIS data collection and counting methodology used to produce nearshore estimates.\n131\n\fIn-season Assessments: Hydroacoustic Information\nMethods\nSYSTEM DEPLOYMENT AND DATA COLLECTION\nThe PSC Mission hydroacoustic site is located 80km upstream from the mouth of the Fraser River where the maximum width of the river is approximately 450 metres and the maximum depth varies from 13 to 17 metres depending on discharge levels. The site is operational during the sockeye and pink salmon migration periods, generally from early July to September or October each year. The hydroacoustics site is comprised of the left bank field site, which houses the majority of the field site equipment, and the right bank field site, directly across the river from the left bank site.\nRight bank The right bank field site is an off-grid location directly across the Fraser River from the main work trailer of the Mission program. It is powered by a battery bank which is charged by solar and gas-generator power. The ARIS system is mounted with a pole-mount to an aluminum cross arm attached to the end of a telescopic fish weir (Enzenhofer and Cronkite 2005). Fully deployed, the fish weir extends 20m from the river bank. The river profile on the right bank has a gradual downward slope which is ensonified by an ARIS 1800 unit using one vertical aim, varying between -3° to -8° depending on water levels, to a maximum range of 40m. The aim is split into 4 range bins (Figure 1) and the ARIS system is programed to record each range bin for 10 minutes per hour. The resulting files are transferred wirelessly to the left bank trailer for on-site processing by staff.\nFigure 1. Diagram of the right bank ARIS sampling scheme.\nLeft bank The left bank field site houses the main passage estimation systems. As much as 80% of salmon passage occurs on the left bank and it is monitored using both an HTI split-beam system and an ARIS 1800 imaging sonar. Both systems are mounted to the end of a large fish weir that also acts as a dock and walkway for two vessels that are used at the site. The HTI split-beam system normally samples to a range of 50 to 60 metres, and the ARIS system overlaps the HTI split-beam system to a maximum range of 45 metres. This overlap in sampling area allows the ARIS system to be used as a data verification tool during low to medium abundance scenarios. As left bank passage increases, the split-beam system may become saturated and its individual target recognition capabilities are diminished. The ARIS system does a much better job of tracking individual targets when abundances are high and is relied upon for near shore (0-30m) passage during peak migration events. Further information on the left-bank splitbeam system can be found in Chapter B11.\n132\n\fIn-season Assessments: Hydroacoustic Information\nDue to the semi-convex shape of the nearshore river bottom on the left bank and the limited vertical beam-width of the imaging sonar, the ARIS system requires multiple vertical aims to sample the entire water column in the first range bin of 0-10m (Figure 2). Two vertical aims (approximately -14°, 0° depending on system deployment and water height) are used for the first range bin. The two nearshore aims are configured to minimise “blind areas” near the river bottom and upper water column which can accommodate high salmon passage due to tidal influences. The three farther range bins (10-40m) are sampled using a single aim (-3o) as the vertical beam width of the ARIS system can adequately cover the water column at those ranges. Each aim and range bin are sampled individually on a systematic hourly sampling schedule. Fish passage in each of the stratified spaces is recorded for 10 minutes per hour.\nFigure 2. The non-overlapping stratified hourly sampling spaces by the left bank ARIS system. The left-bank ARIS system is mainly relied upon for passage up to 30 metres nearshore while the splitbeam system extends the sampling range up to 60 metres.\nDATA PROCESSING\nCounting Procedures The ARIS data are collected hourly and each aim/bin is sampled for 10 minutes per hour (Figure 2). The files are uploaded to the central processing computer where they are counted by hydroacoustics staff using the ARISFish software specifically designed by Sound Metrics for post-processing of ARIS data. The staff members count all upstream and downstream fish targets with tally counters, regardless of size, for the first 5 minutes of each file. The coefficient of variation (CV) associated with the resulting hourly fish count estimates is 6.5% (Xie and Martens 2014). It is possible to count the entire 10 minutes of each recording, but the gain in precision is minor (CV of 5.5%). During low abundance scenarios, the playback framerate of the sonar files can be increased to complete the counts faster. When passage rates\n133\n\fIn-season Assessments: Hydroacoustic Information\nincrease, it becomes challenging to count the files in real time, so the framerate is decreased to ensure the counts are accurate.\nGenerating an Imaging Sonar Passage Estimate. Once the Imaging sonar counts associated with a 24 hour period are complete, a total daily fish passage estimate is calculated. In order to generate a passage estimate for salmon, non-salmon species must be removed from the total fish counts. This is achieved by taking length measurements of a subset of fish images from the same imaging sonar files used for fish counting and running them through a mixture model to calculate the proportion of salmon sized targets (Chapter B15). Those proportions are then applied to the corresponding counts to derive the daily salmon passage estimates for both the right and left bank ARIS systems. The ARIS data are then ready to be included in the daily total salmon estimate which also includes passage estimates from the left bank and mobile split-beam systems (Chapter B10).\nReferences Belcher, E., Hanot, W., and Burch, J.

Xie and PSC Hydroacoustics Staff\nSummary At the PSC hydroacoustic site at Mission, salmon are known to utilize the entire 400m river width of the Fraser River as they migrate upstream. While nearshore areas up to 50m from either bank are well monitored by the shore-based sonar systems (Chapter B11 and B13), fish migrating beyond this range are monitored by a downward looking mobile split-beam sonar system deployed from a vessel continuously transecting the river. The transect sampling of the river by the mobile split-beam system acquires information on fish density in the offshore area. This density information is combined with fish speed and direction of travel statistics through a mobile fish flux model to produce a daily estimate of offshore fish passage.\nIntroduction During the summer monitoring season, the width of the Fraser River at the PSC Hydroacoustic monitoring site is, on average, 400m. Due to the reduced strength of underwater sound over longer distances, side-looking sonar systems are unable to effectively detect salmon targets across the entire river. According to Medwin and Clay (1998), in 15oC fresh water, a 200 kHz sound loses approximately 1 decibel of its magnitude per 100m of propagation, or in a linear scale, the sound loses 20% of its intensity per 100m due to attenuation.\nAt the Mission site, salmon are however known to utilize the entire river width for their upstream migration. Fish migrating in nearshore areas (up to 50m from either bank) are well monitored by the shore-based sonar systems; fish beyond this nearshore range are monitored by a downward looking mobile split-beam sonar system deployed from a vessel that continuously transects the river at the site. For more information regarding the configuration of the Hydroacoustics site, please see Chapter B10.\nThe mobile split-beam system acquires data used to estimate fish density in the offshore area. This density information is combined with behavioural statistics, such as fish speed and direction of travel, using a mobile fish flux model, which results in a daily estimate of offshore fish passage. Since the mobile system cannot reliably measure the swimming behaviour of fish while transecting the river, parameters such as speed and direction of travel are based on the fish behaviour in the left-bank nearshore area measured by the left-bank split-beam system (Chapter B11).\nData The mobile split-beam data are collected using a downward looking split-beam transducer towed by a vessel that continuously transects the Fraser River. The vessel is a 6.7m long aluminum hull motorboat (Figure 1a) and its beam (width) is 2.6m with a 0.9m draft in fresh water. The moderately V-shaped hull is designed specifically for surveying fish in shallow waters. The vessel is powered by a stern-drive Volvo Penta 3.0-liter gasoline engine which drives a 3-bladed propeller. During normal transecting, the propeller is kept at a rotational speed ranging from 1200 to 2000 rpm depending upon the discharge level and tidal currents. A GPS receiver is installed onboard to record the transecting trajectory and speed during mobile surveys. On average, it takes about five minutes for the vessel to complete a cross- river transect at the site at a mean cruising speed of 1.4 m/sec (or 2.7 knots). Excluding time spent on\n135\n\fIn-season Assessments: Hydroacoustic Information\nstationary sampling and shift changes and refueling, the vessel completes on average a total of 170 transects per day. The vessel has little impact on the natural behavior of migrating fish at water depths greater than 4m (Xie et al 2008).\nTo survey fish in the offshore areas of the river, which are at most 18m deep, a Biosonics 6o circular nominal split-beam transducer powered by a DT-X echosounder (http://www.biosonicsinc.com) is deployed from the vessel. The transducer is mounted on a towed body on the port side of the vessel (Figure 1b) and is kept in a downward-looking orientation while being towed. The transducer emits 0.2ms long 210-kHz acoustic pulses at a ping rate of 20 pings per second. The sounder’s source level is set at 220dB. Echoes with echo levels exceeding -130dB are logged into the hard drives of the sounder. This raw echo data is suitable for single-echo-detection (SED) processing (Ehrenberg and Torkelson 1996). The SED processing removes any echo signals with acoustic target strength (TS) below -45 dB (adult salmon normally possess TS &gt; -40dB).\nBecause the downward looking split-beam system cannot be used to derive behavioral data, these data are obtained from the stationary left-bank split-beam system instead (Chapter B11).\nFigure 1. (a) The transecting vessel for the mobile survey; (b) The tow-body housing the downward looking split-beam transducer.\nMethods\nOFFSHORE FISH DENSITY\nThe raw echo data are analyzed using an alpha-beta tracker (Blackman and Popoli 1999) by forming tracks of detected targets, that allow to follow the targets over time in a three-dimensional Cartesian space (X, Y, Z). The identified fish tracks are verified by trained staff that review the echogram data with interactive editing software to remove non-fish targets (Figure 2). The tracks are identified by examining the summary statistics of tracks such as their target strength, detection probability, continuity in the space-time domain (echogram) of track trajectories, as well as their echogram patterns prior to SED processing (the raw echo patterns). This visual critiquing and editing procedure is performed each day for all the split-beam data using the Split-beam Fishtrack software developed by the PSC (Xie 2004). The fish track data produced by the mobile split-beam system provides daily estimates of the average number of fish detected per transect across the river. With associated GPS location data, we can obtain the spatial distributions of the detected fish for a cross-section of the river at Mission (Figure 3).\n136\n\fIn-season Assessments: Hydroacoustic Information\nFigure 2. Echogram display of mobile split-beam data comprising 5 complete transects (generated by the PSC Fish Track software). Each of the coloured traces represents an individual fish track, totaling in this case 11 fish. Black dots represent echoes that are noise such as bubbles, debris or the river bottom. These data were collected on September 18, 2018 during the Late-run sockeye dominant migration period.\nFigure 3. Scatter plot of 24-hour cumulative cross-river fish distribution acquired by the mobile split-beam system at the PSC Mission Hydroacoustics site on September 18, 2018. Dots represent locations of detected fish by the mobile system.\nOFFSHORE FISH PASSAGE\nWith the fish density information acquired from the mobile split-beam system using the alpha-beta tracker as well as the Fishtrack software and fish behavior statistics estimated from the left-bank system, a fish flux model is used to combine these two types of information to calculate fish flux: the daily number of fish migrating upstream in the offshore area surveyed by the mobile sounding vessel.\n137\n\fIn-season Assessments: Hydroacoustic Information\nDetailed descriptions of the model can be found in Xie et al. (2002, 2005). The key derivations and resulting model estimator are listed below.\nTo derive the total daily abundance in the offshore area, the offshore fish density data are summarized by individual cells (Figure 4).\nIt has been shown (Xie et al 2002, 2005) that the net upstream fish flux for each cell can be obtained through the following formula: 𝑓 = 𝑚𝑇𝑣𝑢 𝐿\n] ∙ [1 − 2 𝑛𝑑 𝑛𝑑+𝑛𝑢\n[1 − (1 − 𝑣𝑑 𝑣𝑢\n𝑛𝑑 𝑛𝑑+𝑛𝑢∙𝑣𝑑/𝑣𝑢\n]\n\n\n\n) ∙\nwhere L is the full beam-width of the sound-beam at mean depth of the cell, mT is the mean number of fish detected per transect at the cell over a 24-hour sampling period by the mobile split-beam system, 𝑣𝑢 and 𝑣𝑑 are the mean speeds of the up- and down-stream fish detected by the left-bank split-beam system over the 24-hour sampling period, and nu and nd are the totals of up- and down-stream fish detected by the left-bank split-beam system over the 24-hour sampling period.\nThis above equation combines information obtained from the mobile system (transect measurements of mT) and the left-bank systems (shore-based stationary measurements of mean speed and up- versus down-stream fish) to produce a measure of offshore fish flux through individual cells. Summation of the offshore flux over all the offshore cells provides us with the estimate of total offshore fish flux. The key underlying assumption of this equation is that fish behaviour is statistically similar between nearshore and offshore areas. Xie et al (2007) however showed differential behaviour between fish migrating in the inshore areas of left and right banks. Therefore, a direct measurement of offshore fish behaviour would provide more accurate behavioural parameter estimates than the current method and would improve the overall estimate of mobile flux.\nFigure 4. Plot of September 18, 2018 hourly cross-river fish flux: number of fish migrating upstream through individual cells (5m horizontal by 1m vertical) per hour with red colored cells representing a higher number of fish migrating upstream. The total flux estimated by the mobile system for this day is 2819.89 fish/hour. Note: the flux data is displayed in the plot using the river bottom as the vertical reference so that the flat surface waterline is transformed to a curvy line (the blue line) which mirrors the river bottom.\n138\n\fIn-season Assessments: Hydroacoustic Information\nReferences Blackman, S.S., and Popoli, R. 1999.

Xie\nSummary At the PSC Hydroacoustics Site in Mission, BC, information collected from imaging sonars (DIDSON and ARIS) has been used since 2011 to estimate fish passage in nearshore areas off both the left and right banks (Chapter B13). To accurately determine the proportion of fish passage that is comprised of salmon, a length-based mixture model is used to estimate the relative proportions of salmon-sized targets versus small, resident-fish-sized targets. The mixture model is also used to estimate proportions among salmon species, including pink, sockeye, and Chinook, during periods when two or more salmon species are co-migrating past the PSC Hydroacoustics site. Fish length data used by the model are measured from sub- samples of the acoustic images collected by the imaging sonars. The mixture-model-based estimates of salmon proportions are applied to fish passage estimates in nearshore areas on both the left and right banks and are used to produce imaging-sonar-based estimates of daily nearshore upstream salmon passage.\nIntroduction A variety of fish species, either migrating past or residing in the proximity of the PSC Hydroacoustics Site, are detected and imaged by the imaging sonar at the monitoring site. However, the mandate of the PSC Hydroacoustics program is to enumerate salmon passage past the site, specifically sockeye and pink salmon. Therefore, salmon passage must be distinguished from passages of non-salmon species. Salmon species in the Fraser River include Chinook, chum, coho, pink, and sockeye, while resident fish include Peamouth Chub, White Sturgeon, Red-sided Shiners, and a variety of other species (Figure 1).\nImaging sonar acquires acoustic images of fish while they migrate in the river, which allows for the counting of fish as they migrate past the site and the measurement of lengths of individual fish. See Chapter B13 for more information on imaging sonar at the Hydroacoustics site. To differentiate salmon- sized targets from small resident fish, fork lengths (FL), the length from the fish’s nose to its tail, are measured from a subset of the imaging sonar data. Since 2011, a length-based mixture model has been applied to imaging-sonar-based length data at the PSC hydroacoustics site to estimate species proportions. The mixture model statistically distinguishes small resident fish from migrating salmon to generate accurate salmon passage in nearshore areas. Length data are collected and compiled daily and analyzed using the mixture model. The estimated proportions of both small resident fish (around 20 cm in mean FL) and salmon-sized fish (&gt; 40 cm in FL) are applied to the total fish counts produced by the imaging sonar to derive the daily nearshore salmon passage estimates off both banks. The mixture- model-based species proportions can also be used to estimate relative abundances among salmon species. This is used during the Chinook and sockeye comigration period (July to early August) or the initial pink and sockeye comigration period (mid-August to early September) to estimate the abundance of each species. There are other estimation methods for salmon species composition, for more information, see Chapter B16. This document describes the key procedures for measuring lengths from sonar images, and how these lengths are used by the mixture model to estimate species proportions.\n140\n\fIn-season Assessments: Hydroacoustic Information\nFigure 1. Examples of common salmon and resident fish species encountered in the Fraser River, BC. Chinook salmon (A), chum salmon (B), coho salmon (C), pink salmon (D), sockeye salmon (E), Peamouth Chub (F), White Sturgeon (G) and Red-sided Shiners (H).\nData A subset of ARIS fish images are measured to determine their fork lengths (FL) using the vendor provided software, ARISFish. The fork length refers to the length from the fish’s nose to the fork of its tail. Because the resolution of the images produced by the imaging sonar often does not allow for the exact identification of the true ‘fork’ of the fish tails, the locations of the fork are subject to random error. A comparison study between biological FL and acoustically measured FL for sockeye indicates however that acoustically measured FL by imaging sonar is unbiased (Xie et al. 2013).\nOver a 24-hour period, a total of 8 hours (per range bin) of imaging data are subsampled with 20 fish images selected for length measurements. This produces a total of 160 FL measurements for each of the range bins. For the left bank, the image data from all 4 range bins are used for length measurements. This gives a daily total of 20 × 4 × 8 = 640 length measurements per day for the left bank. For the right bank, due to the degrading imaging quality in the furthest bin, the species composition information for Bin3 is used for Bin4. This gives a daily total of 480 length measurements for the right bank per day.\nCorresponding fish passage is counted for 5 minutes per hour in each of the range bins from both the left and right-bank acoustic sites. All fish, except Sturgeon, are counted, including small, presumably resident fish. In addition to the length measurements of fish for which the species is unknown, the mixture model also relies on species-specific length information obtained from test fishing catches in the current as well as previous years. These historical FL data are used as mean length priors in the mixture model.\nMethods Once all the length measurements for a range bin are available, a mixture model is fitted to the resulting distribution of length data to estimate the proportion of different species within the mixture (Figure 2). Three different estimation methods can be used: maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), discriminant function analysis (DFA) and single-value-threshold (SVT) method. The mixture model requires initial values for the means and standard deviations for the distributions of lengths for the different fish species that make up the mixture, i.e. the mean fork length and associated standard deviations for each species. The mean fork lengths of each salmon species is based on the average lengths observed in nearby test fisheries. Early in the season, when test fishing catches are still limited, marine FL data or previous’ year means can be relied upon until more relevant data become available. While the acoustically measured FL is unbiased, the measured lengths are subject to random, unbiased errors due to various factors such as the aspect angle and the range of ensonified fish. This results in a sigma or a coefficient of variation (CV) of acoustically measured length for sockeye salmon that is larger than that\n141\n\fIn-season Assessments: Hydroacoustic Information\nof the true length distribution: 13% vs. 6% (see Figure 3). The mixture model assumed a CV of 13% for both sockeye and Chinook’s measured lengths. The assumption of Chinook’s measured lengths having the same CV as sockeye needs to be verified in the future. In addition to prior information on the mean length and the coefficient of variation, the model also requires prior information on the number of species to be classified. The most used prior for the number of groups is a 3: small resident fish, sockeye, and chinook salmon. This 3-group mixture model is used during the early part of the sockeye migration when the river is dominated by these 3 groups and throughout the season during non-pink years. A 4- or 5-group mixture model is used when pink salmon are co-migrating and/or when the lower river test- fishing programs indicate a noticeable presence of jack Chinook in the river.\nFigure 2. Fitting of the length-based mixture model to length data from 3392 fish images acquired by ARIS on the left bank from July 9 to July 28, 2019. Based on these data, the mixture analysis estimates 69% small resident fish, 22% sockeye, and 9% Chinook salmon.\nFigure 3.

(b) histogram of lateral length measurements of 394 fish images acquired by DIDSON at Mission during the sockeye dominant migration period. The mean of the biological FL is 62.4cm and the mean acoustically measured length is 62.3cm. The standard deviations of the 2 data sets are 3.6cm and 8cm, resulting in coefficients of variation of 6% and 13%, respectively.\nDue to the temporal variation of salmon influx in a 24-hour monitoring period, the unweighted sampling of hydroacoustic length data could result in biased species composition estimates, especially when\n142\n\fIn-season Assessments: Hydroacoustic Information\ndifferentiating salmon from resident, non-salmon species. To reduce the bias, the length-based mixture model is also applied to the hourly data. The resulting abundance-weighted model uses a spline-fit algorithm to reconstruct a full time series of hourly salmon proportions from the subsampled length data (Figure 4). Multiplying this hourly proportion time series with the hourly abundance time series leads to an abundance-weighted daily salmon proportion. The details of the mixture model can be reviewed on pages 44-51 of Xie et al. (2013). The model is implemented using the statistical software package R and can be readily run under the platform of R-Studio (https://rstudio.com/).\nFigure 4. Reconstructed hourly salmon proportion time series for September 24, 2018, indicating both the 8 hours of observed proportions (black circles) as well as projected proportions (red circles). The daily salmon proportion was estimated to be 74%.\nOne of the advantages of the length-based mixture model is that it allows to provide species composition information on days when test fishing catches are absent or small. In addition, model results tend to be robust when distinguishing small resident fish from sockeye and adult Chinook. However, when using a 4 or 5-group mixture model during the periods of comigration with pink salmon and/or relatively large proportions of jack Chinooks, resulting species composition estimates can be subject to large uncertainties given the limited differences in average lengths between the species.\n143\n\fIn-season Assessments: Hydroacoustic Information\nReferences Martens, F.J., Michielsens, C.G.J., and Xie, Y. 2011.

Michielsens\nSummary Species composition estimates are essential for translating daily fish passage estimates at the hydroacoustic site at Mission, BC, into daily sockeye abundance estimates. Since 2009, fish passage at the hydroacoustic site has been estimated using a combination of split-beam and imaging sonars (DIDSON and ARIS, Chapter B13). A mixture model is applied to histograms of fish length data measured from the imaging files to estimate the relative proportions of salmon-sized targets versus small, resident-fish-sized targets and to derive daily salmon abundance estimates (Chapter B15). The abundance estimates can be further separated by salmon species using a variety of different data sources and methods. The different methods each have their own shortcomings which may be more pronounced depending on sample sizes and the relative and/or absolute abundance of the different species. The selection of the method to estimate species specific abundances is dependent on the concurrence between estimates, known biases under different conditions, and sample sizes. The following reports provide an overview of the different methods and describes some of these biases.\nIntroduction As part of the Treaty agreements (Diplomatic Note of August 13, 1985), the Fraser River Panel is responsible for the collection of hydroacoustic data at Mission, BC, and to enumerate salmon passage past the site, specifically sockeye and pink salmon. The process to estimate the number of sockeye and pink salmon is a two staged process. First, salmon passage must be distinguished from passage of non- salmon resident fish species, which include Peamouth Chub, White Sturgeon, Redside Shiner, and a variety of other species. This is done by measuring the acoustic lengths of individual fish and fitting a mixture model to the resulting distribution of length data to estimate the proportion of salmon versus resident fish (Chapter B15). In a second stage, the proportion of sockeye and/or pink salmon will need to be determined. Within the Fraser River, salmon species also include Chinook, chum, and coho salmon. The proportion of Chinook salmon can be substantial when sockeye abundances are low early in the season or during years of low sockeye abundance. There are a multitude of different methods that can be used to determine species composition and the different methods will be described here as well as their known biases.\nMethods\nSALMON VERSUS NON-SALMON SPECIES PROPORTIONS\nThe distinction of salmon versus non-salmon species is made using fish length measurements of individual fish acquired using the acoustic image of the fish obtained through imaging sonar. More specifically, the fork lengths (FL), the length from the fish’s nose to the fork of its tail, are measured from imaging sonar data using vendor-provided, user-driven software (ARISFish by Sound Metrics Corp). Over a 24-hour period, a total of 8 hours of imaging data are subsampled with 20 fish images randomly selected for length measurements. This produces a total of 160 fork length measurements for each of the hydroacoustic sampling areas. A mixture model is fitted to the resulting distribution of length data to estimate the proportion of different species within the mixture (Figure 1). Three different estimation\n145\n\fIn-season Assessments: Daily Abundance Estimates\nmethods can be used: maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), discriminant function analysis (DFA) and single-value-threshold (SVT) method. The maximum likelihood method will require initial values for the means and standard deviations for the individual distributions that make up the mixture. The resulting model might fit the data but the individual distributions might not always make biological sense, e.g. results may eliminate certain species such as jack Chinook even though there is evidence from the test fishery that this age group of Chinook salmon should be present. The MLE method is especially prone to errors when the sample size is small. The strength of the DFA method lies in the fact that the method relies on Bayesian priors for the individual distributions, i.e. mean lengths and standard deviations. This model therefore can produce results even when sample sizes are small but the resulting mixture model might not fit the data very well. The SVT method uses length thresholds for the different species. It works well when there is no overlap in the length distributions of the different species or when the overlap is symmetrical. The larger the asymmetry in the overlap, the larger the bias in the SVT proportion estimates. This method is least preferred but allows for verification of the other estimates.\nFigure 1. Fit of the mixture model to length data from 3392 fish images acquired by ARIS from July 9 to July 28, 2019 on the left bank over a range bin of 10 to 30 meter. The resulting mixture model estimates 69% of the fish to be small resident fish, 22% are sockeye and 9% are Chinook salmon.\nSALMON SPECIES PROPORTIONS\nA multitude of different species methods are used to derive daily sockeye and pink salmon abundance estimates from the total daily salmon passage estimates (Table 1, Martens et al., 2019, Michielsens and Cave, 2013). Traditionally, salmon species composition are derived from catch data collected by the Whonnock test fishery with the proportions based on gilled and girthed catch. In case of low daily salmon catch numbers (&lt;15), catches also include tangled salmon. When catches are low, these estimates are however very uncertain and highly variable. In addition, this method has some known biases as pink salmon, who migrate primarily near-shore, tend to be less vulnerable to this test fishery, resulting in an underestimate of pink salmon abundance. Chinook salmon on the other hand tend to have a higher catchability, resulting in an overestimation of Chinook abundances. Similar analyses can be done with the catch data from the Qualark test fishery. The resulting daily sockeye abundance\n146\n\fIn-season Assessments: Daily Abundance Estimates\nestimates can be considered minimum estimates of the abundance that passed the Mission site given the fact that several sockeye stocks migrate past Mission but do not pass Qualark, i.e. Chilliwack (Early Summers); Harrison (Summers); and Birkenhead, Big Silver, Weaver, and Cultus (Late run). For Chinook, the daily abundance estimates at Qualark early in the season can be considered estimates of the Chinook abundance at Mission given that the Chinook stocks that do not migrate past Qualark, i.e. Chilliwack and Harrison, are later timed fall Chinook. The same concerns about assuming equal catchability applies for this method. The catchability correction model aims to reduce the potential biases due to differences in catchability by estimating a different catchability for the different salmon species. In recent years, the correction to the resulting sockeye abundances have been limited to the low sockeye catches.\nAn alternative estimate of daily sockeye abundance at Mission can be obtained by using sockeye CPUE data from the Whonnock test fishery in combination with a historical expansion line estimate (1/catchability). This method is regularly relied upon early in the season when no hydroacoustic data are yet available, or in pink salmon years when daily salmon abundances are dominated by pink salmon stocks. While the daily sockeye abundance estimates derived from CPUE data may differ substantially from the hydroacoustic based sockeye abundance estimates when available, averaged over three days, the CPUE based method produces similar abundance estimates unless catchability in a given year deviates substantially from average. The Chinook CPUE data from the Albion test fishery can be similarly used in combination with a historical expansion line estimate to derive daily Chinook abundance estimates at Mission (Hawkshaw, 2018). In cases when salmon species are limited to sockeye and Chinook salmon, the daily sockeye abundance can be estimated by subtracting the daily Chinook abundance estimates from the total daily salmon estimates. Similar concerns remain about the representativeness of the historical catchability estimates in the current year.\nIn the past, there has been clear evidence that the differences in catchability estimates can lead to overestimated Chinook abundance estimates, whereby the sum of the daily reconstructed Chinook abundance greatly exceeded the total post-season run size of Fraser River Chinook. To ensure daily estimates are in-line with realistic total run size estimates for Chinook salmon, the preseason Chinook run size forecasts of 6 different Chinook groups (Spring 1.2, Spring 1.3, Summer, 1.3, Summer 0.3, Chilliwack and Harrison) are used in combination with the timing and spread of each stock group to forecast daily Chinook abundances across the season and the associated uncertainty around those daily estimates i.e. the 95% probability interval (Figure 2). In case no alternative species composition data are available due to a lack of test fishing catches or if the resulting estimates are considered unreliable, the median forecast of the daily Chinook abundance can be used to derive daily sockeye abundance estimates. Alternatively, the upper 97.5% confidence limit can be used to cap the daily Chinook abundance estimates derived from test fishing catch data. While it is possible to exceed the upper confidence limit on a given day or several days, consistently exceeding this limit would require that Chinook returns exceed the 97.5th percentile of the forecast.\n147\n\fIn-season Assessments: Daily Abundance Estimates\nFigure 2. Boxplot of daily Fraser River Chinook abundance forecasts, based on 2020 run size forecasts for Spring 1.2, Spring 1.3, Summer, 1.3, Summer 0.3, Chilliwack and Harrison Chinook, used in combination with migration timing and spread estimates.\nIn recent years, returns of Fraser River sockeye have been extremely low. As a result, the relative sockeye abundance has decreased, and the importance of accurate species composition estimates increased. The majority of the species composition methods discussed thus far rely on in-river test fisheries whose catches decrease with decreasing abundances. In recent years, it has been especially challenging to obtain catch data early in the season when abundances are lowest or for catches to be sufficiently large to obtain desired sample sizes from which to derive species composition estimates. Hydroacoustic length information has not experienced similar sample size challenges and the stratified species composition method has been used to derive salmon species composition estimates. The method is stratified as it relies on the hydroacoustic length information and the mixture model for the species composition of the salmon abundance along the left and right bank and the Whonnock test fishing catch data for the species composition in the midsection of the river. The mixture model however performs best when the different species differ substantially in mean lengths which is the case when distinguishing sockeye from resident fish. Pink and sockeye salmon are however more similar in length and especially in years with larger pink salmon and smaller sockeye, the limited difference in average lengths may result in increasingly uncertain species composition estimates. Alternatively, fish wheel information can be used for the species composition along the shore.\nOther methods exist to estimate in-river species composition and these are tracked but not used very often given the large associated uncertainty. One of those methods relies on marine CPUE data of Fraser River sockeye used in combination with an expansion line (Chapter B4). The resulting daily marine abundance estimates can be used in a forward reconstruction to predict the number of sockeye within the river. When using this method for species composition, only historical expansion lines can be used, resulting in the larger uncertainty as using the in-season expansion line requires knowing the sockeye abundance at Mission.\n148\n\fIn-season Assessments: Daily Abundance Estimates\nTable 1.

In- season, the different methods are run jointly, and the resulting sockeye, Chinook and pink salmon abundances are compared. Concurrence in abundance estimates when relying on multiple different methods will provide increased confidence in the use of species composition estimates derived from those methods while deviation from other estimates will decrease an estimate’s credibility.\nPlanned Changes and Potential Areas for Improvement Improvement to the estimation of the species composition has been one of the recommendations identified during the Hydroacoustic Review (Conrad et al., 2019). That review resulted in the development of the catchability correction model. Currently, there are plans in place to further expand the species composition methods by including a non-linear CPUE model and an integrated multi-species model that would incorporate the various data sources. Species composition estimation can also be improved by evaluating the performance of the different models. Thus far, the lack of known post- season abundance estimates for the different species has prevented the use of retrospective analyses to\n149\n\fIn-season Assessments: Daily Abundance Estimates\nevaluate model performance. Alternatively, the bias and precision of the different methods could be evaluated through simulations. Such a simulation study has been undertaken for the mixture model, but this work has not yet been expanded to include the stratified version of the mixture model.\nReferences Conrad, B., Dufault, A., Hawkshaw, M., Huang, A., Jenkins, E., Lagasse, C., Lapointe, M., Litz, M., Martens, F.J., Michielsens, C., Scroggie, J., Staley, M., Whitehouse, T., Wor, C., and Xie, Y. 2019.

In-season Application of Stock ID Information\nE.S. Jenkins, F.J. Martens and C.G.J. Michielsens\nSummary Fraser River sockeye are managed by management group, as per the Pacific Salmon Treaty. Therefore, stock proportion estimates must be applied to catches, in-season abundance indices, and escapement estimates in order to split the data into the four current management groups. Sockeye catch samples are taken from test fisheries (Chapter B5), as well as other fisheries when available, and the mix of stocks within that sample is determined through scale and genetic analyses (Chapter B8 and B9). The resulting stock proportion estimates are not only used to determine the stock proportions of the total catch from which the sample was taken, but are also assumed to represent the stock proportions of the sockeye that escaped the fishery and continued their upstream migration. If no samples are taken to represent a particular catch, then stock proportion estimates based on another catch (that best represents that group of fish) are applied. The resulting stock-specific estimates of catch and escapement past Mission are then used in further reconstructions to assess, for each management group, the total run size in marine areas (Chapter B18), as well as the potential escapement to the spawning grounds.\nIntroduction According to the Pacific Salmon Treaty (PST 2020, Chapter 4, section 3), Fraser sockeye salmon stocks are managed as part of four stock management groups: Early Stuart, Early Summer run, Summer run and Late run. This stipulation within the treaty requires salmon catches and escapement abundance estimates to be split into the four different stock aggregates corresponding with each of the four different management groups.\nPSC staff conduct sampling programs designed to identify stock proportions of Fraser River sockeye salmon in marine areas as well as in the river. This is done by sampling the catches from test fisheries; these samples are assumed to represent the stock composition of the available fish. The resulting stock composition estimates are used in combination with daily abundance estimates obtained from in-river hydroacoustic data (Chapter B10) and from marine catch-per-unit effort (CPUE) data (Chapter B2) to derive daily abundance estimates by management group, both in marine areas as well as in the river. Stock proportions are also applied to assign catches by the different fisheries (commercial, test, Ceremonial & Subsistence (C&S), First Nations, and recreational fisheries) to different management groups.\nStock proportion estimates are essential for reconstructions. For backwards reconstructions (Chapter B18), the stock-specific daily escapement estimates past Mission are added to the stock-specific catch abundances seaward of Mission, resulting in stock-specific daily marine abundance estimates. These marine daily abundance estimates allow for assessment of the associated run size, either using time density models (Chapter B19) when only part of the run has been observed in-season, or using the total marine abundance when the entire run has been observed. Similarly, forward reconstructions using stock-specific daily escapement estimates past Mission, in combination with stock-specific daily catch abundance estimates upstream of Mission, allow for the prediction of the number of spawners expected to reach the spawning grounds or other locations within the watershed (Qualark, for example).\n151\n\fIn-season Assessments: Daily Abundance Estimates\nData The data required for daily reconstructed abundance estimates include catch, escapement, and stock ID (as well as the stock ID sample size). To derive time-series’ of stock-specific daily abundance estimates, the daily estimate of total sockeye escapement past the hydroacoustic site at Mission is multiplied with stock proportion estimates derived from catch samples. Stock-specific catch data are included for backward reconstructions of the marine abundance estimates, as well as the forward reconstructions of the potential spawning escapement. Further information on the derivation of daily abundance estimates at Mission, daily catch information, and daily stock proportion estimates from catch samples can be found in Chapters B10, B18, and B8, B9, respectively.\nCurrently, 20 different sockeye stocks are accounted for in the stock proportion estimates: 19 Fraser River sockeye stocks and the remaining non-Fraser stocks, which are combined into one group (Chapter B9). The majority of the samples analyzed using scale reading and DNA methods are obtained from test fishing catches (Chapter B1). As a result, for each of the test fishing locations, there exist 20 time-series of stock proportions covering the entire duration of a fishery. Additional catch samples from commercial, C&S, First Nations, and recreational fisheries are also analyzed. However, the logistics of collecting, transporting and analyzing samples from these additional fisheries in a timely fashion for in- season assessments is complex, and the resulting time series of stock proportion estimates may not cover all fisheries in all areas for their full duration. In addition, limited abundances and / or low salmon catchability may result in sample sizes below the recommended 100 fish in marine area test fisheries and 50 fish for in-river test fisheries. Therefore, the size of the sample from which the stock proportion estimate has been derived is important for the successful application of stock proportion estimates. The sample size helps to determine the uncertainty associated with an estimate; it can also indicate the need to combine stock proportion estimates across multiple days.\nMethods Stock proportion estimates are applied to both abundance and catch estimates. It is important that the stock proportion estimates are applied to all days and areas associated with the abundance time series, not only the days on which the catch was taken or for the fisheries from which the catch was taken. There are several options to estimate stock proportions when no sample was taken or analyzed on a given day or for a particular area. Stock proportions can be borrowed from a previous or following day, interpolated between days before and after, or borrowed from a nearby fishery. In cases where information from other fisheries is used, the date of the information is offset to reflect the time required for the sockeye to migrate between the two fishing areas, therefore ensuring that the stock proportion information from the other fishing area reflects the same block or group of fish. In cases where a sample size is much smaller than the recommended amount, the samples for several days may be combined and the resulting stock proportions applied to the catches on all of the days included in the sample. Especially in the river, limited sample sizes can be a serious issue, and requiring more complex methods to combine stock proportion information from various samples.\nOnce stock proportion time series’ have been completed and cover all days, areas, and fisheries for which abundance estimates or catch data are available, they can be multiplied to generate stock-specific daily abundances and catch estimates (Figure 1). These stock-specific estimates can be summed by management group and across days to generate management-group-specific estimates of abundance and catch to date. In addition, the stock-specific daily estimates can also be used within backward reconstructions to generate stock-specific daily marine abundance estimates, or within forward reconstructions to calculate stock-specific daily abundance estimates expected to reach the spawning grounds (Chapter B18).\n152\n\fIn-season Assessments: Daily Abundance Estimates\nFigure 1. Data flow for the collection and application of stock proportion estimates to escapement estimates and catch data. Used within reconstruction models, it allows the generation of stock-specific daily abundance estimates in marine areas (to be used for run-size assessment purposes) and at the spawning grounds (to be compared against spawning escapement targets). Processes are represented by blue rectangles and resulting estimates by green rectangles with rounded corners.\nPlanned Changes and Potential Areas for Improvement Currently, 20 different sockeye stock groups are accounted for by the stock proportion estimates and the files associated with the assignment of stock proportion estimates to catch and escapement data are therefore called the CR20 files (Catch and Racial files for 20 groups). Based on DNA stock ID methods, the number of groups can be expanded to close to 90, and a new set of CR files has been created to account for this expansion: CR100 files. While it is not advisable to use the estimates in the CR100 files at their finest resolution, storing the data at this level ensures increased flexibility in terms of grouping the different stocks and ‘rolling-up’ the estimates according to the different groupings. In addition, the CR100 files include several non-Fraser stock groups rather than combining them into one group. Currently, a database is being created that would store the data from the CR100 files. Once completed\n153\n\fIn-season Assessments: Daily Abundance Estimates\nthis database will allow flexible, multi-year queries to be performed on the catch and escapement data by stock and management group, and estimates to be rolled up in a variety of ways, including temporally, geographically, etc. In the future, we might also switch to using the CR100 files in-season.\nReferences PST. 2020.

In-season Marine Reconstructions\nM.J. Hague and C.G.J. Michielsens\nSummary Run reconstructions are a key tool for fisheries stock assessment and allow biologists to combine catch and escapement data to estimate daily abundances and annual run size. The Pacific Salmon Commission (PSC) is responsible for developing and applying run reconstruction models for Fraser River sockeye salmon as well as disseminating and archiving the resulting estimates. In-season reconstructions are applied both forward and backwards. Forward reconstructions predict stock-specific escapement into the river based on marine daily abundances derived from stock-specific catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) data from marine test fisheries (Chapter B2) combined with assumptions about migration speed and delay behaviour. Backward reconstructions add stock-specific daily estimates of marine and lower river catches to stock-specific daily escapement estimates (Chapter B10) to reconstruct the total daily abundance in marine areas. The estimates are used to derive time series of marine timing, migration spread and diversion rate. Backward reconstructions also allow to update in-season test fishing catchability estimates (Chapter B4). The following report describes the basic structure and underlying assumptions of the reconstruction model, and the time series it generates.\nIntroduction Management of Fraser River sockeye salmon fundamentally relies on accurate estimates of run size (for deriving the amount of total allowable catch (TAC)), and migration behavior (to determine how to access the TAC). As part of the Pacific Salmon Treaty (PST) agreements (PST 2020, Chapter 4, paragraph 13(a)), Commission staff are responsible for providing in-season updates to Fraser River sockeye salmon run size, timing, and diversion rate.\nRun reconstructions have been a key tool for salmon fisheries management for over 80 years; their application first thoroughly described by Starr and Hilborn (1988). PSC Secretariat Staff are responsible for developing and applying run reconstruction models for Fraser River sockeye (Cave and Gazey 1994) and archiving their results. Within these reconstruction models, stock-specific daily marine and lower river catches are added to stock-specific daily escapement estimates obtained by the PSC hydroacoustic facility (Conrad et al. 2019) to reconstruct daily abundances as the salmon run as it approaches the marine areas around Vancouver Island. In-season, daily reconstructed abundances are used to provide the best in-season estimate of run-size, timing, and diversion for Fraser River sockeye populations, either directly from the reconstructed abundance or when used within in-season assessment models (Michielsens and Cave 2018), project abundances of fish expected to be available to different fisheries, and update test fishery catchability estimates (Chapter B4).\nAfter the fishing season concludes, reconstructions are used to update several time series of sockeye migration behaviour, including marine timing (date when 50% of a run has passed through marine areas), northern diversion (percent of a run migrating through Johnstone Strait), spread (number of days comprising 95% of the marine migration), and delay (days holding off the mouth of the Fraser River in the Straight of Georgia). In addition, Canada relies on historical time series of run size, timing, and diversion to generate pre-season forecasts (Chapters A1 and A2) which are critical inputs for pre-season planning and simulations (Cave and Gazey 1994, Chapter A6 and A7) and are also used as informative\n155\n\fIn-season Assessments: Daily Abundance Estimates\npriors in Bayesian in-season run size models (Michielsens and Cave 2018, Chapter B19). In addition, historical run reconstructions are used in retrospective evaluations of fishery harvest rates (PSC 1995) and to develop decision rules for updating in-season test fishery catchability coefficients (Chapter B4).\nData The key data used to reconstruct daily marine abundances along the Johnstone Strait and Juan de Fuca route are: test fishery catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) data (Chapter B2), test fishery catchability (Chapter B4), landed catches, Mission daily abundances (Chapter B10) and stock identification (Chapter B9). To populate the reconstruction model, information is also required regarding migration distances between fishery areas and the river, as well as assumed migration rates (Hague et al. 2019). Summer run sockeye are assumed to migrate a distance of 257km in 6-days, corresponding to an average daily migration rate of 43km/day between the Area 20 purse seine test fishing location and the Mission hydroacoustic site. Late-timed sockeye are assumed to take an average of 8-days, covering 32km/day, to make the same journey.\nMethods The box-car run reconstruction model assumes salmon move in groups, i.e., box-cars, from the marine areas to the Fraser River through a series of fisheries that will impact the number of salmon in a group (Cave and Gazey 1996). The assessment of Fraser River sockeye relies on two different reconstruction approaches: backward reconstruction and forward reconstruction, and both are used to assess Fraser River sockeye salmon (Figure 1).\nFigure 1. Schematic illustration of a basic box-car run reconstruction model. The colored bars represent different statistical fishing areas, with the left most square representing the most seaward location. Each “fish/hook” represents one day of fishing. Each fish represents one daily block of fish. Black fish in each panel are not exposed to a fishery opening on a given day, while grey fish are. Each panel represents a daily time-step. The top panel represents the shape of the unfished run prior to entering marine approach fisheries. The bottom panel represents the shape of the run at Mission, with certain days of abundance reduced due to catch removals.\n156\n\fIn-season Assessments: Daily Abundance Estimates\nThe backwards box-car reconstruction is used to estimate total daily marine abundances by adding seaward catches (C) onto daily abundance estimates (N) at Mission. To simplify the reconstruction, dates (d) associated with the daily catch report (the catch date) from each fishery (f) in each statistical area (A) and the daily abundance data at Mission (the upstream migration date) are adjusted to the date associated with a geographical reference point. For the reconstruction and assessment of Fraser River sockeye salmon the reference point used is the site of the Area 20 purse seine test fishery located at the seaward entrance of Juan de Fuca Strait. The dates associated with the data from other areas are adjusted based on the amount of time (rounded to the day) it takes for sockeye to migrate to these areas from the reference point. Assuming it takes 6 days for Summer run sockeye to migrate between Area 20 (A20) and Mission (AMission) implies a 6 day offset (oA20, Mission) that would result in the Area 20 date (dA20) associated with abundance estimates at Mission (NMission) to be 6 days earlier than the actual date:\n\n\n\n𝑁𝑑𝐴20,𝐴𝑀𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 = 𝑁(𝑑−𝑜𝐴20,𝑀𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛),𝐴𝑀𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛\n= 𝑁(𝑑−6),𝐴𝑀𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛.\nThe same assumptions about migration speeds and associated offsets are also made for the sockeye migrating through Johnstone Strait. For example, it takes about 7 days to migrate from the Area 12 purse seine test fishing site to Mission, resulting in an offset of -1, making the corresponding Area 20 date for catches caught by purse seine test fishery (fPS,TF) in the Area 12 (A12) one day later than the actual date:\n\n\n\n𝐶𝑑𝐴20,𝑓𝑃𝑆,𝑇𝐹,𝐴12 = 𝐶(𝑑−𝑜𝐴20,𝐴12),𝑓𝑃𝑆,𝑇𝐹,𝐴12\n= 𝐶(𝑑+1),𝑓𝑃𝑆,𝑇𝐹,𝐴12.\nThe following description assumes that all the dates associated with the data have already been adjusted to the correspond to the Area 20 reference date. Also, the reconstruction is implemented for individual stocks (s) but this has been omitted from the descriptions to simplify the equations. Information on the application of stock ID within the reconstructions can be found in Chapter B17.\nIn addition to adjusting all dates to a common reference date, reported catch data that may include catches across several ‘blocks’ of fish (due to the large size of the statistical area for which they are reported) are spread across n migration days depending on the fishery and the statistical area so that the sum of the catch proportions (pn) equals the total catch reported:\n\n\n\n𝐶𝑑20,𝑓,𝐴 = ∑ 𝑝𝑛 ∙\n𝐶𝑑20−𝑛+1,𝑓,𝐴. For the actual backward reconstruction, all the daily seaward catches along both approach routes are added to the daily Mission passage estimates to reconstruct the total daily abundance (𝑁𝑑𝐴20) at the entry of the marine fishing areas:\n𝑛 1\n\n\n\n𝑁𝑑𝐴20 = 𝑁𝑑𝐴20,𝐴𝑀𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 + ∑ 𝐶𝑑𝐴20,𝑓,𝐴.\nIn-season, forward reconstructions are used that remove the daily catches between the marine area and Mission from the daily marine abundance estimates to predict daily abundances at Mission.\n\n\n\n𝑁𝑑𝐴20,𝐴𝑀𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛\n= 𝑁𝑑𝐴20 − ∑ 𝐶𝑑𝐴20,𝑓,𝐴.\nIn this case, the daily marine reconstruction estimates are based on test fishery CPUE data (Chapter B2), used in combination with catchability estimates (Chapter B4). CPUE-based marine abundances and the derived Mission abundances are important in-season as they provide an early indication of abundances prior to fish arriving at Mission. Both gillnet and purse seine CPUE data are relied upon in-season. Each day, the marine reconstruction model allows stock assessment biologists to select which test fisheries to rely upon as well as to average estimates when data from more than one test fishery are available for a particular area. Within the reconstruction files, marine test fishery CPUE data are also combined with reconstructed abundances from Mission to provide in-season updated catchability estimates (Chapter B4). This further allows the selection of catchability estimates for the different test fisheries in the\n157\n\fIn-season Assessments: Daily Abundance Estimates\nreconstruction, i.e. rely on historical pre-season expansion lines or a variety of different in-season and adjusted in-season expansion lines depending on the available test fishery data.\nDERIVED TIME SERIES\nBoth forward and backward reconstructions are essential to derive additional time series of diversion through Johnstone Strait, the proportion of Late run delaying its upstream migration, the timing of the run and the spread.\nThe daily (northern) diversion rate estimates, i.e. the proportion of the total daily estimate migrating through Johnstone Strait, are based on CPUE data from test fisheries operating in Juan de Fuca and Johnstone Straits (Putman et al. 2014).\nThe reconstruction is also used to derive daily estimates of delaying Late run and Harrison stocks (Lapointe et al. 2003). Delaying Fraser River sockeye stocks are defined as holding in the Strait of Georgia for an extended number of days (or weeks) prior to redistributing and migrating upstream, resulting in a roughly bi-model distribution. Instead of using Mission passage to update test fishing catchability estimates for delaying stocks, the difference between marine abundances and upstream escapement is used to estimate the number of salmon delaying their upstream migration. The quality of these predictions will depend on the quality of the CPUE-based daily abundance estimates. Post-season, the estimates of delay can be improved by rescaling the CPUE-based abundances so that the total of CPUE-based daily abundances equals the total post-season run size, i.e. the sum of the total reconstructed daily abundance estimates at Mission plus seaward catch. It should be noted that in the case of delaying stocks, it is not possible to run the backward reconstruction as the box-car movement assumption is broken and the Mission escapement and catches cannot be aligned with seaward abundances.\nThe reconstructed daily abundance time series are also used to derive estimates of timing and spread. The marine migration date, also referred to as the Area 20 date or marine 50% date, indicate the date when half (50%) of the run would have passed through Area 20 assuming all fish migrated via that route. The spread is defined as the number of days of migration comprising 95% of the run.\nThese historical time series are used in forecasting models (Chapter A2) that set pre-season expectations, allow for the prediction of fisheries impacts (Chapter A6 and A9) and serve as informative prior probability distribution inputs into the in-season stock assessment models (Michielsens and Cave 2019, Chapter B19).\nPlanned Changes and Potential Areas for Improvement More complex post-season reconstruction files are already in development, with increased stock resolution, improved flexibility and transparency in migration assumptions, and the ability to reconstruct abundance time series to multiple locations of interest (Hague et al. 2019). The post-season files also incorporate additional information and a more complex series of decision rules to derive marine abundances used in forward reconstructions and for delaying stock groups. While several of these improvements are only possible post-season, the ability to reconstruct time series to key index locations would improve the capacity for evaluating route-specific catches and abundances as well as generate projections of species and stock-specific encounter rates in-season.\n158\n\fIn-season Assessments: Daily Abundance Estimates\nReferences Cave, J.D. and Gazey, W.J. 1994.

Michielsens\nSummary The in-season assessment of Fraser River sockeye salmon relies on the Bayesian implementation of a time-density model to estimate run size and associated run timing. This model is fit to available catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) data from gill net test fisheries in statistical fishing Areas 12 and 20, purse seine data in Areas 12, 13 and 20 (Chapter B2), and reconstructed daily abundance estimates derived from hydroacoustic data collected at Mission (Chapter B10) and seaward catches. The model relies on prior probability distributions of run size, timing, standard deviation (or spread), diversion rate, and test fishery catchability based on pre-season forecasts or historical observations (Chapters A1 and A2). Updated posterior distributions are produced by the model for timing, abundance, diversion, and sometimes spread, but the catchability priors are not updated. Instead, the daily catchabilities are assumed to be fixed but uncertain inputs, based initially on historical estimates, and later on in-season observations as they become available (Chapter B4). Early in-season, the model tends to underestimate the number of days for the salmon to pass through marine areas, and therefore the standard deviation of the migration (spread) is also considered a fixed but uncertain parameter. If necessary, this assumption can be relaxed after the peak of the run has been observed. The model is applied to stock aggregates which share similar migration timing and fall within the same management groups. For stocks that delay their upstream migration, only marine CPUE are used to assess the run, resulting in larger run size uncertainty in comparison to stocks that also rely on marine reconstructed data.\nIntroduction The Fraser River Panel is responsible for the in-season management of Fraser River sockeye stocks, as stipulated by the Pacific Salmon Treaty between Canada and the United States (PSC in-season). Under the terms of the Treaty, Commission staff are responsible for providing the Panel and Technical Committee with in-season updates of run size. Historically, two different methods had been relied upon for the in-season assessment of salmon stocks: regression models relating indicators of abundance (or cumulative abundance) on a given date with total run-size estimates obtained post-season (Fried and Hilborn 1988, Ryall 1998) and time-density (or cumulative time-density) models that estimate the proportion of the migration on a given date (Walters and Buckingham 1975, PSC 1995, Springborn et al. 1998). These time-density models rely on the date of peak abundance as well as the shape of the daily abundance profile over time. They can be fit to abundance indices such as catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) data from commercial or test fisheries, as well as absolute estimates of abundance reconstructed from catch and real-time escapement data.\nWhile time-density models have the advantage that the timing of the migration is an estimated model parameter compared to a fixed input as is the case for alternative in-season assessment models that rely on regression analyses using catch or CPUE (PSC 1995, Ryall 1998), the simultaneous estimation of timing and run size can also pose some challenges. The peak of the run can only be confirmed once more than 50% of the migration has been observed. Consequently, prior to the peak, runs that are small and early or late and large may be indistinguishable (Adkison and Cunningham 2015). The integration of all available sources of data and information within the assessments is therefore important to ensure\n160\n\fIn-season Assessments: Run size assessment\ntimely in-season management decisions. Bayesian methods offer an ideal platform for such analyses while also accounting for the uncertainty in the resulting estimates (Fried and Hilborn 1988, Hyun et al. 2005). This document describes a general time-density model developed in a Bayesian framework for the in-season assessment of run size and timing for Fraser River sockeye salmon.\nData The in-season assessment of Fraser River sockeye stocks relies on four types of data: Lower Fraser River daily abundance estimates from the hydroacoustic program at Mission, catches seaward of the hydroacoustics program, test fishing catch and effort, and stock identification data (Woodey 1987). The reduced allowable exploitation of Fraser River sockeye in recent years has increased the reliance on test fishing CPUE information rather than commercial data as an index of abundance. The main marine test fisheries for in-season assessments are the gill net and purse seine test fisheries in DFO statistical Areas 12 and 13 (Johnstone Strait), and Area 20 (Juan de Fuca Strait). The combined CPUE data from these two Straits provide time series of relative daily abundance. Reconstructed estimates of daily absolute abundance in the same areas are derived through backward reconstruction methods (Starr and Hilborn 1988) using upstream daily passage estimates by the Mission hydroacoustics program in combination with seaward catches (Chapter B18). Both the CPUE and the reconstructed data are multiplied by stock proportion estimates (Chapter B17) to produce multiple timeseries resolved at finer stock resolutions. Separate models are then parameterized for stock aggregates within each management group that have distinctly different migration timing, catchability, or migration behaviour (e.g. delay or non-delay). To simplify the model description within this report, stock indices have been omitted from the model equations.\nIn-season, the marine CPUE data are considered early indicators of the expected daily abundance at Mission 6-days later, as it takes Fraser sockeye approximately 6-days to travel from the marine test fishery locations to the hydroacoustic site at Mission. Therefore, in-season, there is a 6-day lag between CPUE and reconstructed timeseries. In addition, reconstructed marine abundance estimates are only available for stocks that do not delay their upstream migration into the Fraser River due to the violation of basic reconstruction assumptions (Chapter B18). For stocks like Harrison and delaying Late run stocks, only marine CPUE data can be used to assess these stocks, resulting in larger run size uncertainty.\nMethods The following model description assumes that all timeseries have been offset in order to align with a single geographical reference location associated with the Area 20 purse seine test fishing site (Chapter B18). Date indices corresponding to data from all other locations are adjusted accordingly based on the relative difference in assumed fish migration time between Area 20 and Mission, and the migration time between the location of interest and Mission. For example, it takes approximately 7-days for sockeye to migrate from the Area 12 purse seine test fishing site to Mission, making the corresponding Area 20 date for the CPUE data of the purse seine test fishery in Area 12 one day later than the actual date. All dates mentioned in the description of the time-density model below refer to Area 20 dates.\nIN-SEASON TIME-DENSITY MODEL\nThe in-season time-density model to assess the run size and timing of different Fraser River sockeye groups relies on a time-density function to represent the daily salmon migration past the marine test fishing locations (Mundy 1979, Cave and Gazey 1994, Springborn et al. 1998). Two different versions of the time-density model are used depending on the available test fishing data and the associated quality. The marine gill net data are of lower quality as a relative index of abundance compared to the purse seine data given the substantially lower catchability of sockeye salmon by gill nets versus purse seines,\n161\n\fIn-season Assessments: Run size assessment\ni.e., they catch a much smaller proportion of the run. The marine gill net data are however essential for the assessment of early-timed, low abundance stocks for which the cost of running expensive purse seine test fisheries would be prohibitive. Given the high variability in the individual gill net CPUE time- series for the Area 12 and 20, the two time-series are combined into a total CPUE time-series to assess the combined abundance migrating through marine areas. In cases where purse seine CPUE data are available, a more detailed version of the model assesses the abundance in both approaches separately. The following paragraphs will first describe the model using marine gill net data, followed by a description of a more complex model version incorporating data from both gear types.\nThe daily abundance of salmon (Nd) passing the marine reference locations on a given day d can be represented as:\n\n\n\n𝑁𝑑 = 𝑁 ∙ 𝑓(𝑑)\nwhere f(d) is the time-density function of migrating salmon, i.e., the daily proportion of the total run size and N is the total run size or the total recruitment of salmon, available to coastal fisheries. For Fraser sockeye, we assume a normal distribution of migrating salmon over time (Gilhousen 1960, Cave and Gazey 1994):\n\n\n\n𝑓(𝑑|𝑇, 𝑆) =\n𝑒−\n1 ( 2\n𝑑−𝑇 𝑆\n)\n1 𝑆√2𝜋\nwhere T is the mean timing of the salmon migration and S is the standard deviation. Reconstructed daily 𝑜𝑏𝑠) deviate from the daily abundances predicted by the time-density model (Nd): marine abundances (𝑁𝑡\n\n\n\n𝑁𝑑\n𝑜𝑏𝑠 = 𝑁𝑑 + 𝑣𝑑\nwith 𝑣𝑑~𝑁(0, 𝜎𝑣 (Nd), the associated CPUE by the gill net (GN) test fishery on that day (Id,GN) is given by:\n\nreflecting the deviation. Based on the salmon abundance available on a given day\n\n\n\n\n𝐼𝑑,𝐺𝑁 = 𝑞𝑑,𝐺𝑁 ∙ 𝑁𝑑\nwhere q represents the catchability coefficient, i.e., the proportion of the daily abundance taken as catch by one unit of effort. The observed CPUE data differ from the model predictions assuming lognormal residual errors:\n\n\n\n𝑜𝑏𝑠 = 𝐼𝑑,𝐺𝑁 ∙ 𝑒𝑥𝑝(𝑤𝑑,𝐺𝑁) 𝐼𝑑,𝐺𝑁\nwith 𝑤𝑑,𝐺𝑁~𝑁(0, 𝜎𝑤,𝐺𝑁\n2\n).\nIn cases when purse seine test fishery data are available in addition to gill net data, the time-density model is expanded to include daily abundance estimates in Johnstone as well as Juan de Fuca Strait:\n\n\n\n𝑁𝑑,𝐴12 = 𝑁 ∙ 𝐷 ∙ 𝑓(𝑑) and 𝑁𝑑,𝐴20 = 𝑁 ∙ (1 − 𝐷) ∙ 𝑓(𝑑)\nwhere Nd,a is the daily abundance on a given day d in area a (A12 or A20), and D is the (northern) diversion rate, i.e. the proportion of the run migrating through Johnstone Strait (A12) (Chapter A2). For gill net test fisheries, it is assumed that the sockeye catchability is the same in Johnstone Strait versus Juan de Fuca Strait. Therefore the Gill net CPUE on a given day (Id,GN) is:\n\n\n\n𝐼𝑑,𝐺𝑁 = 𝑞𝑑,𝐺𝑁 ∙ (𝑁𝑑,𝐴12 + 𝑁𝑑,𝐴20).\nFor purse seine test fisheries, it is assumed that the catchability depends on the relative width of the area swept or sampled, i.e., the width of the migratory channel at the test fishing site in relation to the size of the fishing net. Because the relative width of the area swept in Juan de Fuca Strait is 2.2 times larger than in Johnstone Strait, it is assumed that the sockeye catchability of the purse seine test fishery in Area 12 is 2.2 times greater than in Area 20. Similarly, the catchability in Area 13 is assumed to be 1.5\n162\n\fIn-season Assessments: Run size assessment\ntimes greater than in Area 12, or 3.3 times greater than in Area 20. The purse seine CPUE on a given day in the Area 12, 20 and 13 (Id,PS,a) is therefore respectively:\n\n\n\n\n𝐼𝑑,𝑃𝑆,𝐴20 = 𝑞𝑑,𝑃𝑆,𝐴20 ∙ 𝑁𝑑,𝐴20,\n𝐼𝑑,𝑃𝑆,𝐴12 = 2.2 ∙ 𝑞𝑑,𝑃𝑆,𝐴20 ∙ 𝑁𝑑,𝐴12, and\n\n\n\n𝐼𝑑,𝑃𝑆,𝐴13 = 3.3 ∙ 𝑞𝑑,𝑃𝑆,𝐴20 ∙ (𝑁𝑑,𝐴12 − 𝐶𝑑,𝐴12)\nwhere Cd,A12 is the total catch taken between Area 12 and 13 on a given day. The observed CPUE data for the different test fisheries (f) differ from the model predictions assuming lognormal residual errors:\n\n\n\n𝑜𝑏𝑠 = 𝐼𝑑,𝑓 ∙ 𝑒𝑥𝑝(𝑤𝑑,𝑓) 𝐼𝑑,𝑓\nwith 𝑤𝑑,𝑓~𝑁(0, 𝜎𝑤,𝑓 abundances (Nd) predicted by the time-density model:\n2 ). Reconstructed daily marine abundances (𝑁𝑑\n𝑜𝑏𝑠) deviate from the daily\n\n𝑁𝑑\n\n𝑜𝑏𝑠 = 𝑁𝑑,𝐴12 + 𝑁𝑑,𝐴20 + 𝑣𝑑\nwith 𝑣𝑑~𝑁(0, 𝜎𝑣 reconstructed daily abundance estimates will not be available.\n\nreflecting the deviation. For stocks that delay their upstream migration,\n\nBAYESIAN IMPLEMENTATION INCORPORATING PRIOR KNOWLEDGE\nThe time-density model described above requires the simultaneous estimation of total run size (N), 2 and timing of the migration (T), the diversion rate (D), and the variances of the residual error terms (𝜎𝑣 2 ). For several of the model parameters, additional information is available to formulate informative 𝜎𝑤 prior probability distributions which can be incorporated using a Bayesian estimation approach (Gelman et al. 1995). The prior probability distributions for run size, timing and diversion rate are based on the pre-season forecasts (Chapters A1 and A2). The assumed distributions for run size, timing and diversion rates are respectively a lognormal, normal and beta distribution (Table 1). The normal prior probability distribution for the standard deviation of the migration (S) is based on historical data. Because early in- season, the model tends to underestimate the spread of the migration (i.e. the number of days it takes for the 95% of the run to pass through the marine test fishing areas), this model parameter is considered fixed but uncertain by default. However, this model parameter can be estimated if in-season data clearly indicates a strong deviation from historical standard deviations.\nFor the catchability coefficient (q), a normal prior probability distribution is assumed for the inverse of the catchability coefficient (q-1), i.e., the expansion line. At the start of the season, the prior probability distributions for the gill net and purse seine expansion lines are based on historical data, but later in the season, these distributions are based on in-season observations (Chapter B4). Unlike other prior probability distributions, these distributions for expansion lines are not further updated by the model. Uninformative gamma distributions are used as priors for the residual error terms (𝜎𝑣\n2 and 𝜎𝑤\n2 ).\nFigure 1 provides a graphical overview of the Bayesian time-density model as described above. This model was developed and is run in WinBUGS 1.4 (Spiegelhalter et al. 2003) and called from the statistical software package R (R Core Team 2013). All the model results undergo diagnostics to remove the impact of initial MCMC samples, to eliminate the negative impact of autocorrelation within the MCMC chains and to ensure convergence (Best et al. 1995). We assume the reported statistics of the posterior probability distributions represent the true underlying distributions.\n163\n\fIn-season Assessments: Run size assessment\nFigure 1. Graphical overview of the Bayesian time-density model when applied for the in-season assessment of Fraser River sockeye. Prior probability distributions (A) based on preseason forecasts of run size, migration timing and standard deviation of the migration allow the prediction of the daily abundance of salmon assuming a normal distribution of migrating salmon over time (B). Reconstructed daily marine abundance estimates and marine test fishery CPUE data are collected and updated continuously throughout the salmon migration (C) and the model predicted daily abundance estimates are fitted to these data. Relative abundance estimates such as CPUE data however require an additional model parameter, in this case a catchability estimate. The uncertainty in daily abundance estimates derived from CPUE data is therefore represented using boxplots. Comparing the model predictions against the data allows the model to derive the posterior probability distributions of the model parameters (A). To simplify this figure, the probability distribution for the diversion rate and the variance parameters have been omitted.\n164\n\fIn-season Assessments: Run size assessment\nTable 1.

In-season SMURF Model\nS. Latham and C.G.J. Michielsens\nSummary The in-season assessment of run size and associated run timing of Fraser River sockeye salmon consists primarily of the Bayesian implementation of a time-density model (Chapter B19). This model relies on reconstructed daily abundance estimates (Chapter B18), which are initially based on marine test fishery data until, six days later, these preliminary estimates can be replaced by daily hydroacoustic estimates of migration past Mission (plus seaward catch). For Late-run stocks, which delay and redistribute prior to migration into the Fraser River, it is not possible to replace the daily estimates from test fishing with daily hydroacoustic-based estimates, and this leads to larger in-season run size uncertainty. To ameliorate impacts of this uncertainty when assessing Late-run stocks and fill the Late-run information gap when making in-season management decisions, an alternative abundance-prediction method (SMURFing, i.e., Smolt Method of Updating Run Forecasts) was developed. This method relies on in-season estimates of early-returning stocks to predict abundances of later-returning stocks, assuming equal post-smolt marine survival among stocks. This method takes advantage of juvenile sampling programs and stock compositions of seaward-migrating juveniles produced by those programs. To the degree that relative abundances are the same in returning adults as in the outmigrating juveniles, the estimated returns of earlier stocks are predictive of the returns of later stocks. During dominant Shuswap return years, this method is applied to predict the abundance of Late Shuswap/Portage from in-season run-size estimates of Early Thompson in combination with estimates of relative abundance from the juvenile outmigration. Uncertainty in juvenile stock compositions and in-season run size estimates for Early Thompson stocks contribute to uncertainty in the predicted run size for Late Shuswap/Portage, as do potential violations of assumptions.\nIntroduction Due to extreme interannual variability in marine survival, return strengths of Fraser River sockeye have been highly unpredictable in recent years. For example, recruits per effective female spawner varied from less than 1 in the 2005 brood year to more than 12 in the 2006 brood year (DFO 2018), resulting in returns below the 10th percentile and above the 90th percentile in pre-season forecasts in 2009 and 2010, respectively. Due to such variability, the prediction intervals of forecasts have broadened, reducing their utility for effective fishery planning, and intensifying demand for accurate and timely in- season assessments of abundance. For example, in 2018, the 80% probability interval for the total return of Fraser River sockeye was 5 - 37 million (see Chapter A1).\nThe challenge of forecasting Fraser sockeye abundance in the pre-season has necessitated an intense in- season assessment program, and run sizes are typically estimated with time-density models. These models rely on the date of peak abundance and the shape of the daily abundance profile over time (Chapter B19). The daily marine abundance estimates are derived through reconstructions (Chapter B18) and are initially based on test fishery data. Once the salmon migrate into the Fraser River and pass the hydroacoustic site at Mission, these initial estimates are replaced with hydroacoustic-based estimates for most stocks. Unfortunately, some Late run stocks delay and redistribute prior to migration into the river, making it impossible to replace the uncertain test fishing-based estimates. In addition, in-\n167\n\fIn-season Assessments: Run size assessment\nseason run-size estimation using the time-density model is only possible when 50% of the run has been observed. Prior to the peak, runs that are small and early or late and large may be indistinguishable (Adkison and Cunningham 2015). As a result, management is under-informed about Late-run sockeye when making fisheries management decisions. Other information, however, may be available to help bridge this gap.\nStock proportions are important for planning fisheries in their own right, with respect to impacts on non-target stocks. In addition, the relative abundances they represent are somewhat less difficult to predict than absolute abundances (run sizes), reflecting positive correlation in productivity amongst stocks (Latham and Michielsens 2022). Broad regional correspondence in productivity trends emphasize the important role of factors impacting survival in coastal areas where the stocks share similar environments early in their marine lives (Mueter et al. 2002). To take advantage of correlated marine survival, a ‘Smolt Method of Updating Run Forecasts’ (SMURF) was developed that uses the in-season run size estimates of an earlier-returning ‘Reference Stock’ and the ratio among stocks in out-migrant juveniles to provide an in-season run-size estimate of the later-returning ‘Predicted Stock’. This estimate is both independent of the pre-season forecast and available before traditional in-season run-size updates for the Predicted Stock. As described below, this method helps to fill the information gap between the pre-season forecast and the in-season time-density model results that become available after the peak of the run has been observed.\nData The model for SMURFing requires at least two highly processed data inputs: (i) relative stock composition estimates among outmigrant juveniles (smolts or post-smolts) captured two years prior to the year of return, and (ii) in-season estimates of the run size of 2-ocean sockeye from a Reference Stock in the year of return. Stock compositions are estimated for outmigrating juveniles with DNA as in Beacham et al. (2004). Run size for a Reference Stock is generally estimated using a time-density model (Chapter B19) or reconstruction-based (Chapter B18), but also alternate estimates of run size can be used, e.g., terminal hydroacoustics for Chilliwack sockeye on the 2020 cycle line. If stock composition estimates (Chapter B9) used in generating daily abundances and run-size estimates for the Reference Stock use the same method as for the juvenile stock composition, biases inherent in the method may be at least partially offset.\nStock compositions of returning adults are estimated mostly from catches in Statistical Areas 12, 13, 20, and 29 (Chapter B5). Samples of outmigrating juveniles can be collected from multiple locations, including lake outlets, river main stems, or marine locations where a high proportion of the outmigration passes during a short period of time (e.g., the Discovery Islands in Areas 12 and 13, Neville et al. 2016). The latter may be preferable (Latham and Michielsens 2022), but more replicates across years should be obtained to test that idea. For returns in 2018, juvenile samples were collected in 2016 from (i) the Mission downstream trap operated by DFO (Mahoney et al. 2013), (ii) salmon trawl and seine programs operated by DFO in Areas 12-16 (Neville et al. 2016), and (iii) hand-operated seine sampling conducted in Areas 12 and 13 by Hakai Institute (Johnson et al. 2019). Resulting genotypes were graciously shared with the PSC Secretariat by these organizations.\nSMURFing could theoretically be used in many circumstances but could be most beneficial in predicting in-season run size of later-timed stocks that (i) are important for fisheries management considerations, and (ii) are difficult to estimate in a timely manner using traditional time-density methods or other methods. The Late run on Shuswap dominant years is a prime example, due to the effects of their migration delay and redistribution as described above (Chapter B18). It is important for fisheries management to obtain early in-season run-size estimates for these Late-run stocks, and even more so given the overlap in migration between management groups. Therefore, in-season run-size estimates of 168\n\fIn-season Assessments: Run size assessment\nEarly Thompson are used in combination with relative juvenile abundance estimates of Early Thompson in comparison to Late Shuswap/Portage to produce early in-season Late-run run size estimates.\nIn-season age composition estimates are additional data inputs required for some applications of this method. As most Fraser River sockeye are 2-ocean fish upon their return, stock proportions of smolts and post-smolts two years earlier are most like stock proportions among returning adults. For Early Thompson and Late Shuswap/Portage on Shuswap dominant cycle years, the proportion of other ages is negligible. With other years or other stocks, however, the proportion of 2-ocean individuals in both the Reference Stock and the Predicted Stock must be estimated from scale samples from sockeye identified to those stocks using DNA in-season. The abundance of 2-ocean sockeye in the Reference Stock predicts the abundance of 2-ocean sockeye in the Predicted Stock, with the latter scaled-up to represent the return of all ages. In-season age estimates are derived from scales collected and analyzed at the PSC Secretariat Office (Chapter B7).\nMethods Depending upon several critical assumptions, in-season estimation of earlier-returning stocks can, in combination with the ratio between earlier stocks and later stocks among out-migrating juveniles, be used to produce a quantitative prediction regarding the abundance of later-returning stocks. Of the various assumptions made when using this method, the most critical are the assumptions of equal catchability of juveniles among stocks and equal survivability among stocks between the juvenile sampling period and recruitment to adulthood. That is, SMURFing requires unbiased, representative samples of the post-smolt stock proportions, and it requires that those proportions are the same when the sockeye return to the Fraser River. The method makes other assumptions, but violations of those other assumptions (e.g., equivalent maturity schedules in the Reference Stock and Predicted Stock) are more amenable to study and estimated to have a relatively minor impact. A more complete list and evaluation of assumptions can be found in Latham and Michielsens (2022). Violations of most assumptions are expected to be reduced among stocks with juveniles that smolt at similar sizes and follow similar migration routes on similar dates.\nThe following paragraphs provide a detailed description of the model as it was applied to assess the run size of Late Shuswap/Portage in 2018. The model assumed that the abundance (N) of Late Shuswap/Portage (LShP) stocks versus Early Thompson (ETho) stocks was the same, in a relative sense, for post-smolt juveniles (J) as for returning adult recruits (R):\n\n\n\n𝑁𝐽,𝐸𝑇ℎ𝑜 𝑁𝐽,𝐿𝑆ℎ𝑃\n=\n𝑁𝑅,𝐸𝑇ℎ𝑜 𝑁𝑅,𝐿𝑆ℎ𝑃\n.\nThe ratio of post-smolt abundances could be rewritten as:\n\n\n\n𝑁𝐽,𝐸𝑇ℎ𝑜 𝑁𝐽,𝐿𝑆ℎ𝑃\n=\n⁄\n𝑁𝐽,𝐸𝑇ℎ𝑜 (𝑁𝐽,𝐸𝑇ℎ𝑜+𝑁𝐽,𝐿𝑆ℎ𝑃) 𝑁𝐽,𝐿𝑆ℎ𝑃 (𝑁𝐽,𝐸𝑇ℎ𝑜+𝑁𝐽,𝐿𝑆ℎ𝑃)\n⁄\n=\n𝑝𝐸𝑇ℎ𝑜 𝑝𝐿𝑆ℎ𝑃\n=\n𝑝𝐸𝑇ℎ𝑜 (1−𝑝𝐸𝑇ℎ𝑜)\nwith pETho representing the proportion of Early Thompson post-smolts from the combined sample of post-smolts from Early Thompson, Late Shuswap/Portage. Equation 1 could then be re-written as\n\n𝑁𝑅,𝐿𝑆ℎ𝑃 = 𝑁𝑅,𝐸𝑇ℎ𝑜 ∙ ((1 − 𝑝𝐸𝑇ℎ𝑜) 𝑝𝐸𝑇ℎ𝑜\n\n⁄\n)\nwith NR,ETho being the in-season run size for Early Thompson, and NR,LShP the in-season run size for Late Shuswap/Portage.\nEarly during the in-season management period, the run size of Early Thompson was derived through the application of a time-density model fitted to daily reconstructed marine abundance estimates as well as catch-per-unit effort (CPUE) data collected by gillnet and purse test fishing vessels in Statistical Areas 12 and 20 (Michielsens and Cave 2019, Chapter B19). As the season progressed, the Early Thompson run\n169\n\fIn-season Assessments: Run size assessment\nsize was derived by combining: 1) daily reconstructed marine abundance estimates on days for which abundances had been estimated at the Mission hydroacoustic site, 2) six-day projections of marine abundances based on marine CPUE data in combination with marine catchability estimates, and 3) predictions of the abundance seaward of marine test fisheries based on the time-density model. The resulting run size estimate for Early Thompson, including the associated uncertainty, was used as an uncertain input into the model to predict the run size of Late Shuswap/Portage. For this model, we assumed a lognormal distribution for the Early Thompson run size:\n\n𝑁𝑅,𝐸𝑇ℎ𝑜 ~ Lognormal(ln(𝑚), 1/𝑙𝑛(1 + 𝐶𝑉2))\n\nWith m and CV being the median and coefficient of variation of the in-season run size distribution for Early Thompson.\nThe proportion of Early Thompson post-smolts (pETho) among out-migrating smolts of both Early Thompson and Late Shuswap/Portage was estimated assuming the observed Early Thompson smolt 𝑜𝑏𝑠 from various juvenile sample collection programs in different areas (A) followed a proportions 𝑝𝐸𝑇ℎ𝑜 binomial distribution:\n\n𝑝𝐸𝑇ℎ𝑜,𝐴\n\n\n𝑜𝑏𝑠\n\nBinomial(𝑝𝐸𝑇ℎ𝑜, 𝑛𝐴)\n\n\nwhere nA was the total sample size of Early Thompson and Late Shuswap/Portage post-smolts in area A. Bayesian application of this model required a prior probability distribution for the Early Thompson post- smolt proportion, which was assumed to be an uninformative, uniform distribution between 0 and 1:\n\n𝑝𝐸𝑇ℎ𝑜 ~ Uniform(0,1).\n\nThe model described above was developed and run in WinBUGS 1.4 (Spiegelhalter et al. 2003). Model results underwent diagnostics to remove the impact of initial MCMC samples, to eliminate the negative impact of autocorrelation within the MCMC chains, and to ensure convergence (Best et al. 1995). We assumed that the reported statistics of the posterior probability distributions represented the true underlying distributions. Results were reported in terms of the median and the 80% probability interval (PI).\nResults In 2018, the median pre-season forecast for the return of Late Shuswap/Portage sockeye was 7.0 million (80% PI: 3.3 – 15.1 million), comprising 99.5% 2-ocean sockeye. At the median forecast, this group was forecast to contribute 95% of the total return of the Late-run management group. Two years prior, in 2016, the ratios of Late Shuswap/Portage to Early Thompson out-migrating juveniles did not differ significantly across juvenile programs (p = 0.31), and the average was 4.4 to 1 (80% PI: 4.1 – 4.8). This ratio was applied to the in-season run size estimate of Early Thompson to generate an estimate of the Late Shuswap/Portage run. On August 10, the first in-season Late Shuswap/Portage SMURFing estimate was presented to the Fraser Panel, 3.6 million (80% PI: 2.6 – 5.0 million), based on an Early Thompson estimate of 0.81 million (80% PI: 0.63 – 1.07 million). Two weeks later (August 24), when the Early Thompson estimate was 1.26 million (80% PI: 1.23 – 1.32 million), the corresponding SMURFing estimate for Late Shuswap/Portage was 5.6 million (80% PI: 5.2– 5.9 million).\nThe resulting uncertainty in the run-size estimate for Late Shuswap/Portage was a function of the uncertainty in the ratio of Late Shuswap/Portage to Early Thompson in the juvenile sample and the uncertainty in the in-season run size estimate of Early Thompson. The former estimate (the ratio and its uncertainty) was a fixed property of the juvenile sample, whereas the latter estimate fluctuated as dictated by in-season data, trending toward lower uncertainty as more of the Early Thompson run size\n170\n\fIn-season Assessments: Run size assessment\nwas accounted for by high-precision hydroacoustic and catch accounting methods. SMURFing estimates change with every update to the estimated abundance of the Predicted Stock.\nThe results from SMURFing can be compared against other in-season and post-season estimates. In 2018, the first time-density model estimate of Late Shuswap/Portage was reported to the Panel on August 21 (6.3 million; 80% PI: 4.3 – 19.0 million). On August 24, a more precise estimate (6.3 million; 80% PI: 3.7 – 9.4 million) was presented. From August 28 through mid-September precision of this estimate varied little; the median estimate fluctuated between 5.7 and 6.5 million, while the 80% PI was stable near 3.7 – 7.2 million. The estimated return of Late Shuswap/Portage at the end of the season was 4.5 million, which was 97.5% of the accounted Late run. The final in-season ratio of Late Shuswap/Portage to Early Thompson stocks was 3.4, significantly lower than the ratio of 4.4 estimated from post-smolt samples. In 2014, this ratio was more similar between post-smolt samples and eventual estimates in the 2014 return year (Latham and Michielsens 2022).\nPlanned Changes and Potential Areas for Improvement Because SMURFing to assess Late Shuswap/Portage is only done on 2018 cycle years, and historical juvenile data are limited, evaluations of the performance of this model in comparison to other in-season run-size models has been restricted to 2014 and 2018 and is somewhat anecdotal. It is therefore important to better understand the underlying assumptions: the degree to which these assumptions are violated, factors that minimize or exacerbate those violations, and the impact of those violations on assessments. Future analyses will include a greater number of potential pairs of Reference Stocks and Predicted Stocks to better understand these uncertainties and possibly expand the applicability of SMURFing in Fraser Panel assessment and management.\nReferences Adkison, M.D. and Cunningham, C.J. 2015.

Michielsens\nSummary Early in-season indications of Fraser River sockeye abundance are provided by marine test fishery data. While these abundance estimates are uncertain given both the daily and interannual variability in catchability, once fish reach the hydroacoustic site in the Fraser River, these initial estimates are updated with more precise reconstructed estimates calculated from abundance at Mission plus seaward catches. However, some populations may delay their upstream migration for days, or even weeks. When they do migrate upstream, the fish are often redistributed, making it impossible to replace the initial test fishing-based daily marine abundance estimates with more accurate hydroacoustic-based estimates. Delay in upstream migration mainly occurs among Harrison and Late-run stocks excluding Birkenhead/Big Silver, and has the biggest impact on fisheries management on years with large Late Shuswap abundance (i.e., 2018 cycle line years). On those years, an additional Strait of Georgia troll test fishery is operated in August and September to provide additional information regarding the presence and magnitude of delaying fish. More specifically, the CPUE data from the Gulf troll test fishery is used to predict the abundance of Late-run fish holding in the Strait of Georgia. The resulting estimate can be combined with estimates of upstream fish passage, catch, and abundance seaward of the Gulf troll sampling areas to provide updated estimates of Late-run run size.\nIntroduction As part of the Pacific Salmon Treaty (PST) agreements (PST 2020, Chapter 4, paragraph 13(a)), PSC staff are responsible for providing in-season updates of Fraser River sockeye salmon run size, timing, and diversion rate. For most of the sockeye stocks, preliminary daily abundance estimates derived from marine test fishery catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) data are later replaced with more precise reconstructed daily abundance estimates based on hydroacoustic data collected at Mission and seaward catches (Chapter B18). However, some sockeye stocks delay their upstream migration and hold in the Strait of Georgia for days, or even weeks (Lapointe et al. 2003). This behavior is most apparent for Harrison, Late- Shuswap and Weaver-Cultus stock components (Lapointe et al. 2003). Due to both the redistribution of the run as well as the large amount of time it may take to reach the river, Mission-based abundance estimates cannot be used for these stocks to update the initial daily abundance estimates from marine test fisheries. The highly variable and unpredictable nature of the extent of the delay further complicates their in-season assessment.\nTo improve in-season assessment information for delaying stocks, a troll test fishery was established in 1987 in the Strait of Georgia, i.e., the Gulf troll test fishery (Chapter B1, Nelitz et al. 2018). While the initial purpose of this fishery was to confirm the presence or absence of a significant number of delaying fish in the Gulf, as well as estimate their abundance, over time these estimates were incorporated formally into the run size assessment procedures for Late-run stocks.\nData The Gulf Troll test-fishery in the Strait of Georgia is usually initiated in mid-August and runs through September. The actual end-date of this fishery depends on the timing of the upstream migration of the\n173\n\fIn-season Assessments: Run size assessment\nrun. During this time, two vessels survey six defined areas, or quadrants, on a weekly basis (Figure 1). Each vessel spends approximately 8 hours covering one quadrant a day (Lagasse et al. 2020), thereby completing the survey of all six quadrants after 3 days. This fishery is typically only in operation on dominant and sub-dominant cycle line years when Late run abundance is expected to be high, and a substantial percentage of Late-run stocks are expected to exhibit delay behavior.\nFigure 1. Location of the six quadrants (Q-1 to Q-6A) surveyed by the Gulf Troll test fishery. All six areas are surveyed by two vessels over the course of 3 days and CPUE of the individual quadrants is weighted by the relative area of each quadrant to derive a combined CPUE estimate.\nThe Gulf Troll catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) is defined as catch-per-1000 hook minutes, where hook- minutes are calculated as the total daily fishing time multiplied by the average number of hooks per line on each vessel (Cave 1997, Chapter B2). To account for density dependent effects on the catchability of the troll test fishery (once a hook has caught a fish, it is no longer fishing), the total CPUE data of all fish species combined is corrected to derive the sockeye-specific CPUE using the following equation:\n\n\n\n𝐶𝑃𝑈𝐸𝑠 =\n𝐶𝑠 𝐶𝑇\n𝑒(0.123+1.012∙𝑙𝑛 𝐶𝑃𝑈𝐸𝑇+0.0746∙(𝑙𝑛 𝐶𝑃𝑈𝐸𝑇)2)\nwhere Cs/CT is the proportion sockeye (s) in the total catch (CT) and CPUET is the unadjusted all-species catch-per-unit-effort. The latter is based on the catch of all target and non-target species including\n174\n\fIn-season Assessments: Run size assessment\nshakers (under-sized juvenile salmonids). These calculations are done for each of the six individual quadrants.\nFigure 2. Relationship between corrected (Equation 1) and uncorrected sockeye CPUE in the Gulf troll test fishery. The solid line is the 1:1 relationship. Outliers are rare occurrences where effort was low, catch of other salmon species was high, and catch of sockeye was low.\nOnce all 6 quadrants have been surveyed, the sockeye CPUE of a survey period is then estimated by weighing the sockeye CPUE of the individual quadrants by the proportion each quadrant represents in the total area surveyed (pq, Table 1):\n\n\n\n6 𝐶𝑃𝑈𝐸 = ∑ (𝑝𝑞 ∙ 𝐶𝑃𝑈𝐸𝑞) 𝑞=1\n.\nAll quadrants carry similar weight except quadrant four (largest area) and quadrant 6 (smallest area). Prior to using the CPUE data in the model to predict the abundance of delaying Late run sockeye, the CPUE data are multiplied with the proportion of Late run stocks within the DNA samples taken from Gulf Troll catches.\nTable 1. Relative proportion of the total Gulf Troll survey area represented by each quadrant (Cave 1997).\nQuadrant\nQ-1 Q-2 Q-3 Q-4 Q-5 Q-6\nRelative size of the survey area (pq) 0.148 0.171 0.176 0.262 0.178 0.065\nMigration into the Strait of Georgia is estimated using a forward reconstruction of daily abundance estimates based on seaward test fisheries (Chapter B18). In the post-season, these daily marine abundances are rescaled so that the total marine estimate is equivalent to the final in-season run size estimate based on Mission abundance plus seaward catch. In the forward reconstruction, a fixed 4-day migration time is assumed between the Area 20 reference location and the entrance to the Strait of\n175\n\fIn-season Assessments: Run size assessment\nGeorgia. Once fish resume their spawning migration, it is assumed they need an additional 4-days to migrate from the Strait of Georgia to the Mission hydroacoustic site.\nThe historical abundance estimates of Late-run salmon resident in the Strait of Georgia on a given day (Nd,SoG) are calculated by removing catches (C) and estimates of daily migration into the Fraser River (Nd,Mission) from the cumulative abundance of fish entering the Strait of Georgia:\n𝑛 (10) 𝑁𝑑,𝐴𝑖 = (∑ 𝑑=1\n𝑁𝑑 − ∑\n𝐴𝑖−1 𝐴=𝐴1\n𝐶𝑑,𝐴\n𝑛 ) − (∑ 𝑑=1\n𝑁𝑑,𝑀𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 + ∑\n𝐴𝑗 𝐴=𝐴𝑖\n𝐶𝑑,𝐴\n)\nwhere Ai indicates the Strait of Georgia area, A1 to Ai-1 indicate all the areas seaward of the Strait of Georgia and Ai to Aj include all the areas seaward of Mission until and including the Strait of Georgia. Equation 3 assumes the dates associated with all catch and abundance estimates are adjusted to reflect reference location dates based on the amount of time (rounded to the day) it takes for sockeye to migrate from the area to the reference location (Chapter B18).\nMethods To estimate the total abundance in the Strait of Georgia, a log-linear regression model is used that relates historical estimates of CPUE to total abundances in the Gulf on a given day (Nd):\n\n\n\n𝑙𝑛(𝑁𝑑) = 𝑎 + 𝑏 ∙ 𝑙𝑛(𝐶𝑃𝑈𝐸𝑑)\nStructural uncertainty and observation error are incorporated into the model through the use of a Bayesian framework. While uncertainty in catchability is accounted for, the model assumes that catchability remains stationary. However, experts (both biologist and fishermen alike) suspect that catchability declines as the season progresses as fish (a) redistribute closer to the river mouth and become inaccessible to fishing gear, and (b) rates of gear attraction decline as salmon stop feeding closer to their spawning time. For these reasons, and also supported by statistical evidence, the historical dataset is divided into two time periods: August and September, and separate models are used in each month to estimate total Late run abundances. Analyses also suggest a statistical difference in model fit between dominant/sub-dominant years and off cycle years. Therefore, various model combinations using different data subsets were explored, including different cycle-line combinations and separation or pooling of August and September timeseries. Due to data limitations, care should be taken when running the model for dominant years only using only September or August data.\nResults The model produces estimate of the number of delaying Late run sockeye in the Gulf of Georgia, both in terms of the median and the 80% probability interval (Figure 3). The resulting estimates can be combined with estimates of observed catch, escapement estimates and seaward projections to derive total run size estimates (Table 2). The seaward projections are obtained from a combination of reconstructed abundance estimates based on more seaward marine test fishing data (Chapter B18) and predictions of the tail of the run seaward of the marine test fishery using the time-density model (Chapter B19).\n176\n\fIn-season Assessments: Run size assessment\nFigure 3.

Management Adjustments\nM.R. Forrest and M.J. Hague\nSummary Management Adjustments (MAs) are the additional fish allocated to escape fisheries for the purpose of increasing the likelihood of achieving the spawning escapement target (SET). The selection of an appropriate MA is within the purview of the Fraser River Panel who take into account en-route losses due to adverse migration condition but also other factors that cause differences between predicted and observed spawning ground estimates (DBEs, Differences Between Estimates). Historical DBE estimates are based on differences between the actual number of spawners on the spawning grounds (spawning escapement SE) and the predicted spawning ground estimates based on the number of salmon migrating past the hydroacoustic site at Mission minus the total catch above Mission (potential spawning escapement PSE, DBE=SE-PSE). Sources for DBEs include en-route mortality as well as errors (bias and imprecision) introduced through the estimates of Mission escapement, spawning ground escapement, First Nations and recreational catches above Mission, and stock composition. Pre- season and in-season, DBE predictions can be obtained through a variety of different methods: based on historical discrepancies or based on observed or forecasted environmental conditions or migration timing. The Fraser River Panel uses these DBE predictions and other tools and information to agree upon MAs for pre-season planning and in-season management.\nIntroduction In-season, PSC staff incorporate Fraser River Panel agreed upon MAs into TAC calculations in accordance with the Pacific Salmon Treaty Chapter IV, section 13b. The Panel relies on a variety of different pieces of information to derive the MA: historical estimates of difference between post-season observations and in-season projections of spawner numbers, i.e., the difference between estimates (DBEs), in-season environmental observations, and in-season model predictions of the DBE. The latter are based on statistical models using observed and in-season forecasts of river conditions and in-river migration timing. The models consider the historical differences between post-season spawning ground estimates (spawning escapement SE) and in-season projections of spawning escapement, i.e., Mission escapement minus catch above Mission (potential spawning escapement PSE, DBE= SE-PSE). For Early Stuart, Early Summer-run and Summer-run stocks, the models relate historical DBE estimates to river conditions measured near Hope, B.C. in the Fraser River (Chapter B24). When discharge levels or temperatures are above average, DBEs also tend to be high. In addition, for Early Stuart and Early Summer runs, in-season estimates are consistently higher than spawning ground estimates even when migration conditions are within normal ranges, and this tendency is also captured by the models. For Late-run sockeye, historical DBEs are related to the date when half the run has migrated past Mission (i.e., Mission 50% date), which captures the impact of the early migration behaviour observed since the mid-1990s on the migration success of these stocks (Lapointe et al. 2003, Chapter B25).\nData The historical escapement differences, 50% migration dates at Hells Gate and Mission and the associated 19-day mean and 31-day mean temperature and discharge estimates are the primary biological data used in the statistical models. The historical DBE estimates and the 50% migration dates\n179\n\fIn-season Assessments: Environmental information\nare summarised primarily by management group, except for some stocks like Pitt, Chilliwack, Harrison/Widgeon and Birkenhead/Big Silver, whose location closer to the mouth of the Fraser River decreases expected en-route losses associated with adverse migration conditions. The resulting DBE data therefore relates to the following groups: Early Stuart, Early Summer run without the Pitt and Chilliwack River components, Pitt River, Chilliwack River, Summer run without the Harrison/Widgeon component, Harrison/Widgeon, Late run group without the Birkenhead/Big Silver component and Birkenhead/Big Silver. Data for other groupings are also maintained, however, currently not used. The historical data ranges from 1977 to present. Some years are excluded for a management group or component to avoid potential biases in escapement estimates: if the year is not representative, if the data collection is not comparable to current practice or if the circumstances resulting in the estimates are unlikely to happen again. A list of the excluded years for each of management group or component can be found on the PSC SharePoint site for the Fraser River Panel among the data set files and is updated regularly.\nThe 50% Hells Gate date for a management group is determined from its Area 20 date (Chapter B18). The travel time from Area 20 to Mission is assumed to be 6 days for the Early Stuart, Early Summer and Summer run sockeye. The subsequent travel time from Mission to Hells Gate is assumed to be 5 days for the Early Stuart and Summer run sockeye and only 4 days for the Early Summer run sockeye. The Late run travel time from Area 20 to Hells Gate depends on their delay before up-stream migration and varies substantially across years.\nThe Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) Environmental Watch Program provides both historical as well as in- season observed and forecasted Fraser River temperatures and flows (Chapter B23). In-season the observations and forecasts of daily temperature and discharge are provided twice weekly, are presented in graphs to Fraser River Panel (Figure 1), and are used within mathematical models to predict the discrepancy between the SE and PSE, i.e., to predict the DBE. The forecasts allow the Fraser River Panel to make informed in-season fisheries decisions 3-4 days after the 50% date in Area 20 but prior to all 19 days of temperature and discharge data are available. This facilitates a more informed decision-making process and allows the Fraser Panel to proactively update in-season management adjustments to improve the probability of achieving spawning escapement goals.\nIn addition to the data used within the models predicting the DBE, the Fraser River Panel also incorporates additional information in their decision-making process. To that aim, the DFO Environmental Watch group also provides temperature data from the Fraser River mainstem and tributaries and how they compare to historical estimates (Table 1). Additional observations such as migration challenges, observed mortalities, pooling fish and observations on the spawning grounds are collected by DFO (DFO Stock Assessment, DFO Resource Management and other research groups) and communicated to the Fraser Panel. This includes the migration challenges encountered following the Big Bar rockslide and subsequent remediation work.\n180\n\fIn-season Assessments: Environmental information\nFigure 1. Example of in-season Fraser River temperature at Qualark, B.C. and Fraser River discharge at Hope, B.C. graph.\n181\n\fIn-season Assessments: Environmental information\nTable 1. Example of in-season Fraser River mainstem and tributary temperatures.\nMethods In-season DBE predictions provided by PSC Secretariat staff are based on temperature and discharge models and run-timing models. For Early Stuart, Early Summer and Summer run, there exist significant relationships between temperature, discharge and historical DBEs (Chapter B24). For Late-run sockeye the mathematical model is a regression model that relates extended freshwater residence to DBE estimates (Chapter B25).\nSome components of a management group are excluded from the models and alternative methods to predict the DBEs for those components are used: Pitt River and Chilliwack for the Early Summer run group, Harrison/Widgeon for the Summer run group, and Birkenhead/Big Silver for the Late run group.\nAmong Early Summer run stocks, Pitt River sockeye do not pass Mission and their passage is therefore not well estimated. In addition, their upstream migration distance within the Fraser River is short and thus they have minimal exposure to adverse river conditions. Given the data issues, a fixed DBE is used for Pitt River based on the median of all years with suitable data. The upstream migration distance to Chilliwack is similarly short, resulting in minimal exposure to adverse river conditions. The timing of this stock is substantially earlier than the timing of other Early Summer run stocks and this would impact the 50% migration date when combined with other Early Summer run stocks. In addition, the abundance of Chilliwack sockeye has not been estimated well prior to the use of DNA to identify stocks. Given the low abundance of Chilliwack on certain years, the DBE for Chilliwack is based on the median of all suitable years of data that have more than 30 sockeye identified as Chilliwack fish within the river. And on dominant and subdominant years, when Chilliwack abundances are higher and the quality of the DBE estimates is therefore greater, only the dominant and subdominant years of data are used to derive the median.\nFor Summer run sockeye, Harrison/Widgeon sockeye data are excluded from environmental DBE models because of their shorter migration distance within the Fraser River and because the relationship between Harrison/Widgeon DBEs and environmental conditions is poor. The DBE for Harrison/Widgeon\n182\n\fIn-season Assessments: Environmental information\nsockeye can also be significant while the DBEs for other Summer run sockeye is much smaller. The DBE for Harrison/Widgeon sockeye is based on the median of all suitable years since the start of the DNA collection.\nFor Late-run sockeye, Birkenhead/Big Silver sockeye are excluded from the DBE models because, unlike other late run stocks, these sockeye don’t delay their upstream migration in Georgia Strait. The DBE for Birkenhead/BigSilver sockeye is based on the median across all suitable years.\nThe Fraser River Panel however manages Fraser River sockeye by management group. To accommodate the different DBEs for each component of a management group, a weighted proportion DBE (pDBE) approach is used. The MA models predict the pDBE for each management group excluding the components that rely on historical medians. Subsequently, a weighted average pDBE is calculated to combine the estimates of the different components. This is done by weighting the pDBE of each component by the associated relative abundance. Because the management group pDBEs depend on the relative abundance of the components, in-season DBEs can change with changes in run-size, regardless of changes in DBE predictions. When the abundances of the components are small relative to the total management group, weighting the pDBE by the components has almost no impact on the aggregate pDBE. The weighted approach is most beneficial for Late run stocks with high proportions of Birkenhead/Big Silver (PSC 2019). Following the results of additional retrospective analyses, the Panel has foregone the weighted approach when the abundance of the components is small relative to the total management group.\nFor in-season Fraser River Panel meetings, the Panel is provided with graphs of Fraser River temperature at Qualark, B.C. and Fraser River discharge at Hope, B.C. (Figure 1), a table of Fraser River mainstem and tributary temperatures (Table 1) and the predictions of the DBE models (Chapters B24 and B25) as well as in river observations such as carcass counts, fish holding behavior and fish condition and reports from the spawning grounds or from other areas with potential migration challenges such as Big Bar.\nThe Panel may choose to adopt (if either party accepts) or not adopt (if both parties reject) the MA estimate corresponding to the pDBE prediction for a management group or may choose a different value as they see fit (by bilateral agreement).\nPlanned Changes and Potential Areas for Improvement There is a cost to underestimating or overestimating in-river loss. When the DBE is underestimated managers do not meet spawning objectives. If the DBE is overestimated harvest opportunities are lost. The DFO Environmental group and PSC staff continue to work at improving the models and tools used to estimate en-route loss.\nCurrently models and other tools are focused on the environmental impact on in-river migration to the spawning grounds. There is currently no way to forecast bias and imprecision in Mission escapement estimates, in-river catch estimates, spawning escapement estimates and stock composition.\nIn addition to the statistical MA models, the Fraser River Panel uses other tools to supplement their decision-making process. They can also use “the Supplemental Approach” which relies on temperature and discharge thresholds identified by the historical data. This method is currently being evaluated through retrospective analyses. The MA models and the additional MA tools aid the Panel in their directive to achieve spawning escapement targets and maximize harvest opportunities for Fraser sockeye.\n183\n\fIn-season Assessments: Environmental information\nAppendix\nTable A1.

Patterson\nSummary The DFO Environmental Watch (EWatch) Program provides PSC managers with scientific advice and environmental data to assess the impact of different environmental factors on the migration success of Pacific salmon in fresh water (https://www.pac.dfo- mpo.gc.ca/science/habitat/frw-rfo/index-eng.html#info). In-season EWatch generates Fraser River forecasts of water temperature at Qualark, B.C. and discharge at Hope, B.C. and provides this information to the Fraser River Panel in bi-weekly reports from July to September. They also provide real time temperature data from key EWatch temperature monitoring stations within the Fraser River watershed and real time Fraser River discharge data from a Water Survey of Canada (https://wateroffice.ec.gc.ca) site in the lower river. The temperature and discharge forecasts are used along with observed daily temperature and discharge in environmental models (Chapter B24) to provide the Fraser River Panel with early indications of adverse environmental conditions and potential en-route losses, that may impact their Management Adjustment (MA) decisions (Chapter B22).\nIntroduction For the management of Fraser River sockeye salmon, the Fraser River Panel relies on Management Adjustments (MAs), which are the additional fish allowed to escape fisheries to increase the likelihood of achieving the spawning escapement target (SET) (Chapter B22). To select appropriate values for the MAs, the Panel relies on a wide range of different pieces of information that allow to evaluate in-river migration conditions and potential en-route losses. Among the information are the results of the models that relate temperature and discharge within the Fraser River to differences between predicted and observed spawning ground estimates, i.e., to Differences Between Estimates (DBEs) (Chapter B24). These models use 19-day average Fraser River temperature at Qualark, B.C. and discharge at Hope, B.C., associated with the 50% migration date of the management group, as model inputs. Of the 19 days, 15 days of data proceed the Hells Gate migration date. The DFO Environmental Watch group is responsible for providing both observed and forecasted Fraser River temperature and flows twice weekly throughout the migration season (Patterson et al. 2008). The 10-day forecasts (Morrison 2005, Morrison et al. 2005, Hague et al. 2014) provide managers with an early indication of the expected DBE and allow the Fraser River Panel to make informed fisheries decisions 3-4 days after the 50% date in Area 20. This facilitates a more informed decision-making process and allows the Fraser Panel to proactively adjust management actions to improve the probability of achieving spawning escapement goals.\nWater temperature and discharge are forecasted by different methods. In the past, a complex hydrological model (Morrison 2005) that required intensive meteorological inputs was used to make the 10-day forecasts of Fraser River temperature at Qualark. Currently the Hope Statistical Model (HSM) (Hague et al. 2014) and a generalized additive mixed effects model (GAMM) (Gardner 2016) are used to forecast Fraser River temperature at Qualark, B.C. The evaluations of the HSM (Hague et al. 2014) and the GAMM (Gardner 2016) models confirmed the benefit of using these less data intensive models to inform fisheries decisions. These models using air temperature and discharge covariates explained a significant proportion of the variability in daily summer water temperatures in the Fraser River. To produce the 10-day forecast of Fraser River discharge at Hope, the first 3 days are forecasted using a\n185\n\fIn-season Assessments: Environmental information\nrouting model based on upstream flows and the next 7 days are forecasted using an historic decay model that tracks the shape of historic hydrograph.\nData The EWatch program has an environmental monitoring program which consists of a comprehensive network of temperature logger stations along key salmon migration routes throughout the Fraser Watershed (https://www.pac.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/science/habitat/frw-rfo/index-eng.html#info) (Figure 1). The EWatch program provides the PSC with observed Fraser River water temperature data from this network of real-time data loggers and from others that are operated by Water Survey of Canada. The EWatch group also provides the PSC with observed discharge data from Water Survey of Canada (https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/water- overview/quantity/monitoring/survey.html).\nFigure 1. Locations of key EWatch and WSC temperature monitoring stations and major Fraser River sockeye salmon spawning grounds (https://www.pac.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/science/habitat/frw- rfo/index-eng.html)\nBecause Hells Gate forms a well-known impediment to salmon migration (Roos 1991, Macdonald et al. 2000) and because there exist long time-series of historical environmental conditions associated with the monitoring stations located at Hope and Qualark (Patterson et al. 2007, Macdonald et al. 2010), these two sites are used as the main geographic reference points to describe Fraser River environmental conditions.\nThe following list provides a detailed overview of the various data sets used to derive the observed and forecasted water temperature and discharge time series:\n• Historical daily mean Fraser River water temperatures recorded near Qualark, B.C.: data prior to\n2007 (Patterson et al. 2007), data from 2007 to current (DFO, EWatch Program).\n186\n\fIn-season Assessments: Environmental information\n• Observed daily Fraser River upstream temperatures measured by Water Survey of Canada (https://wateroffice.ec.gc.ca/login_e.html). Verified and collated by the EWatch program.\n• Observed and Historical daily discharge recorded near Hope, B.C.: Wateroffice, Government of\nCanada - Real-Time Hydrometric Data (https://wateroffice.ec.gc.ca/login_e.html). Due to the inverse relationship between discharge and thermal capacity (Web et al. 2003), discharge explains a significant proportion of the variability in water temperature (Neumann et al. 2003, van Vliet et al. 2011). Daily mean river discharge near Hope, B.C. was identified as providing the best fit to Qualark water temperatures (Hague et al. 2014).\n• Air temperature – Environment and Climate Change Canada (https://weather.gc.ca/).\nWater temperature has a high correlation with air temperature (Cluis 1972, Kothandaram and Evans 1972, Stefan and Preud’homme 1993) because they are influenced by the same heat transfer processes (Mohseni and Steffan 1999). Air temperatures from Kamloops, B.C. were shown to provide the best fit to Qualark water temperatures relative to that from other locations further upstream or downstream in the watershed (Hague et. al 2014).\n• Air temperature forecast - Forecasts of air temperature come from both Environment and\nClimate Change Canada (https://weather.gc.ca/) and Weather Network (https://www.theweathernetwork.com/ca).\n• Hope discharge forecast - Since 2020, forecasted flows have been supplemented by the BC River forecast center, using the CLEVER model (http://bcrfc.env.gov.bc.ca/freshet/map_clever.html).\nMethods The EWatch group uses a combination of the Hope Statistical Model (HSM, Hague et al. 2014) and a generalized additive mixed effects model (GAMM) (Gardner 2016) to produce 10-day forecasts of Fraser River temperature at Qualark.\nThe statistical model to produce 10-day daily forecasts of river temperature (Hague et al. 2014) is a stochastic model in which daily water temperature (T) is predicted using a combination of seasonal and non-seasonal components, similar to Caissie et al. (2001):\n\n\n\n𝑇 = 𝑆 + 𝑅 + 𝑟\nwhereby S is the seasonal (harmonic) variability in water temperature, R is the non-seasonal variability driven by exogenous environmental variables and r is the non-seasonal variability driven by serial autocorrelation. A range of different statistical models following equation 1 are used to forecast the daily temperature. While S and r are common to all these models, the non-seasonal variation in water temperature R is distinct for each model by using seasonal residuals of air temperature, discharge, or air temperature and discharge. A harmonic method (Hague et al. 2014, Cluis 1972, Caissie et al. 2001) to model seasonal trends for the water temperature, air temperature and discharge is applied. The advantage of using statistical models is the relative simplicity and minimal data requirements (Benyahya et al. 2007, Hague et al. 2014). They require less physical input data and typically use readily available measurements of air temperature, river flow, and water temperature along with historical seasonal trends to generate short-term river temperature forecasts (Gardner 2016).\nThe GAMM model is the second model used for short-term forecasting of river temperature and provides broader spatial coverage with more flexible and cost-effective implementation of river temperature forecasting (Gardner 2016). This approach models in-season temperatures by combining a linear regression model for daily water temperature with a sinusoidal smoothing spline of seasonal trends (Gardner 2016):\n187\n\fIn-season Assessments: Environmental information\n\n\n\n𝑇𝑖.𝑗 = (𝛼 + 𝜇𝑗) + 𝛽1𝐴𝑖−1,𝑗 + 𝛽2𝑄𝑖−1,𝑗 + 𝛽3𝑇𝑖−1,𝑗 + 𝛽4𝐴𝑖−1,𝑗 ∙ 𝐿 +\n𝛽5𝑄𝑖−1,𝑗 ∙ 𝐿 + 𝑓(𝑑𝑎𝑦𝑖) + 𝜀𝑖,𝑗 2) and 𝜇𝑗~𝑁(0, 𝜎𝑢\n2).\nWith 𝜀𝑖,𝑗~𝑁(0, 𝜎𝑒\nIn equation 2, Ti,j is the predicted river temperature on day i in year j, Ai-1, Qi-1, Ti-1 are respectively the air temperature, the discharge and the water temperature of the previous day, Ai-1xL is the interaction of air temperature and location and f represents a cubic regression spline smoothing function of Julian day, which allows the model to fit the seasonal trend. The residual error (ε), and year-specific variation of intercept (µj) are normally distributed with a mean of zero. In this model, discharge, air temperature, water temperature, and location are all fixed effects. Discharge (Q, m3/s) is used as a predictor variable to account for the inverse relationship between discharge and river temperature (Webb et al. 2003). Air temperature (A, ℃) is included due to the high correlation between air and water temperature (Kothandaraman 1972, Stefan and Preud’homme 1993) from heat exchange processes (Mohseeni and Stefan 1999). Current water temperature (T, ℃) is a predictor of water temperature in the near future (Caissie et al. 1998). Location (L) is included as a fixed effect due to the differences in mean temperature at different locations, as well as the location-specific effects of air and discharge on river temperature.\nThe model choice (HSM versus GAMM) and forecast inputs are a function of past model performance and the available data. Both the HSM and the GAMM model are evaluated annually by the EWatch group using three main performance metrics (root mean square error, mean raw error and mean absolute error) which compare forecasted and observed water temperature values. Errors in forecasted discharge and temperature are also evaluated. In addition, the model’s performance is evaluated using type I (false-positive) and type II (false-negative) error rates which are associated with critical temperature thresholds related to salmon migration performance and mortality (18-21°C). In future, type I and type II error rates which are associated with critical discharge thresholds will be evaluated as well.\nDischarge is forecasted by two different models. For the first 3-days of the forecast, a routing model based on upstream flows is used (pers. comm. D. Patterson). For the last 7-days of the forecast a historic decay model is used (pers. comm. D. Patterson). This model uses the historic slope for a given day of the year applied to the previous days forecast. Reports describing the methods and comparative analyses to methods used by the B.C. River Forecast Centre are still in progress.\nPlanned Changes and Potential Ireas for improvement As indicated above, the temperature and discharge forecasts are used in-season along with observed temperature and discharge in statistical models to provide managers with an early indication of the expected discrepancy between the predicted and observed spawning ground estimates, i.e. the difference between estimates (DBEs). These DBE models incorporate uncertainty through Bayesian estimates. The Fraser Panel is provided with a confidence level on the likelihood of obtaining different values of a parameter when particular data have been observed (Ellison 1996). However, the Fraser Panel would also like to see the uncertainty in the temperature and discharge forecasts being incorporated. This is something to consider in the future.\nReferences Benyahya, L., Caissie, D., St-Hilaire, A., Ouarda, T.B.M.J., and Bobee, B. 2007a. A review of statistical water temperature models.

DBE Temperature and Discharge Model\nM.R. Forrest and M.J. Hague\nSummary Since 2002, the Pacific Salmon Commission has used environmental conditions in the lower Fraser River to predict differences between potential spawning escapement based on Mission estimates minus upstream catch and escapement on the spawning grounds (Macdonald et al. 2010). Reliably predicting the discrepancy between estimates (DBEs) increases the probability of achieving spawning escapement targets. Temperature and discharge models are used by the PSC to provide the Panel with likely spawning escapement outcomes and the Panel uses this information to determine how many extra fish are needed to meet spawning objectives, i.e. the size of the Management Adjustment (MA, Chapter B22). In these models, mean Fraser River temperature at Qualark, B.C. and mean Fraser River discharge at Hope, B.C. (Morrison 2005, Morrison et al. 2005, Hague et al. 2014) are related to historical timeseries of escapement discrepancies to generate either pre-season or in-season DBE predictions for Fraser River sockeye salmon (O. nerka) management (or run timing) groups.\nIntroduction Under the Pacific Salmon Treaty, the Fraser River Panel has the discretion to add additional fish to the spawning escapement target (SET) set by Canada for Fraser River sockeye salmon (O. nerka) to ensure spawning requirements are met (PST, Article IV, Chapter 4, Paragraph 3b). These additional fish are called the Management Adjustment (MA) and are meant to increase the likelihood of achieving the SET (Chapter B22). Post-season, MAs are defined by the differences between estimates (DBEs), i.e., the difference between the predicted spawning ground estimates (Potential Spawning Escapement, PSE, i.e. the number of salmon migrating past the hydroacoustic site at Mission minus the total catch above Mission), and the actual postseason estimates of the total number of spawners at the spawning grounds (Spawning Escapement, PE), with DBE=SE-PSE. Pre-season and in-season, DBE predictions can be derived through a variety of different methods: based on historical discrepancies, based on observed or forecasted environmental conditions or based on migration timing. This Chapter focuses on the temperature and discharge models developed jointly between the PSC and DFO to predict the DBE for Early Stuart, Early Summer-run and Summer-run sockeye (Macdonald et al. 2010). Each run timing group experiences distinct river conditions, with a greater likelihood of extreme discharge during the early runs and extreme temperature during the summer runs. Environmental extremes are known to create migratory challenges and contribute to increased levels of mortality during the return spawning migration. Historically, when discharge levels or temperatures within the Fraser River are above average, DBEs tend to be high. In addition, for Early Stuart and Early Summer runs, in-season Potential Spawning Escapement estimates are consistently higher than spawning ground estimates even when migration conditions are within normal ranges, and this tendency is also captured by the DBE models.\nData The historical escapement differences (DBEs), Hells Gate 50% dates and associated 19-day mean and 31- day mean temperature and discharge data are the primary data used in the environmentally-based DBE models (Chapter B22). The DBEs are calculated as the difference between the spawning escapement (spawning ground estimate) and the potential spawning escapement (Mission passage minus catch\n191\n\fIn-season Assessments: Environmental information\nupstream of Mission). Each management group has its own DBE dataset because each group experiences different environmental conditions depending on when they migrate up the Fraser River.\nThe Hells Gate 50% date is the date on which 50% of the management group will pass Hells Gate in the Fraser River. The Hells Gate date is calculated based on marine migration dates indexed to statistical Area 20 in Juan de Fuca Strait (Chapter B18). The travel time from Area 20 to Mission (the location of the PSC hydroacoustic monitoring program) is assumed to be 6-days for the Early Stuart, Early Summer and Summer run sockeye. The travel time from Mission to Hells Gate is assumed to be 5-days for the Early Stuart and Summer run sockeye and 4-days for the Early Summer run sockeye. In-season, the Area 20 dates for the different management groups derived through the run size assessment models are converted into Hells Gate Migration dates. This date in return is essential to derive the mean temperature and discharge information for the different management groups as the 19-day mean water temperature and discharge estimates used in-season rely on data 15 days before and 3 days after the Hells Gate date. Post-season, 31 day means are used to summarise the environmental conditions in the Fraser River, based on 15 days of observations before and 15 days after the Hells Gate date.\nThe DFO Environmental Watch Program provides updates of observed and forecasted Fraser River water temperature at Qualark, B.C. and discharge at Hope, B.C. twice weekly throughout the migration season (Chapter B23). Daily observed discharge values are accessed from the Environment Canada Water Office online database (https://wateroffice.ec.gc.ca/login_e.html) and daily observed Fraser River water temperature at Qualark is provided by the DFO Environmental Watch group (Patterson et al. 2007) who also provides the 10 day forecasts of temperature and discharge. The temperature forecast is predicted by a statistical model that uses water temperature, air temperature, river discharge and seasonal trends (Hague et al. 2014) while the discharge forecast is derived by a routing model based on upstream flows and a historic decay model (pers. comm. D. Patterson).\nMethods The temperature and discharge models use environmental conditions in the Fraser River as predictive variables to predict the DBE. There are significant relationships between lower river environmental conditions and historical DBEs for Early Stuart, Early Summer-run and Summer-run management groups (Macdonald et al. 2010, Cummings et al. 2011, Figure 1).\n192\n\fIn-season Assessments: Environmental information\nFigure 1. Relationship between the average 19-day temperature at Qualark and the %DBE (Difference between estimates) and between the average 19-day discharge at Hope and the %DBE for Early Stuart, Early Summer-run and Summer-run sockeye.\nThe resulting DBE temperature and discharge model is expressed as:\n\n\n\n𝑙𝑛 (\n𝑃𝑆𝐸 𝑆𝐸\n) = 𝑎 + 𝑏1 ∙ 𝜇𝑇 + 𝑏2 ∙ 𝜇𝑇\n2 2 + 𝑏3 ∙ 𝜇𝑄 + 𝑏4 ∙ 𝜇𝑄\nWith µ representing the 19-day (in-season) or 31-day (post-season) mean of the Fraser River temperature (T) or discharge (D) around the Hells Gate migration date. The dependent variable is expressed as the ratio of the Potential Spawning Escapement (PSE) over the Spawning Escapement (SE). The log transformation of the dependent variable is required to meet the assumptions of homoscedasticity (Zar 1996) and to constrain predictions in the range 0 or higher. The predictive variables are the 19-day or 31-day mean Fraser River temperature (T) and discharge (Q). The quadratic term for both discharge and temperature is included (T+T2, Q+Q2) in the regression equation.\nIn-season the 19-day means are based on 9 or more days of observed data and 10 or less days of forecasted data, given predictions are only made 10 days out because of constraints in forecasting daily environmental data (Hague and Patterson 2014). The 19-day model provides managers an early in- season indication of the expected DBE in order to be more proactive in their management process as it allows a %DBE prediction to be made between 3 to 4 days after the Area 20 50% date and 1 to 2 days prior to the Mission 50% date. Post-season, once 31 days of observed T & Q data are available for a management group, the MA models are fit to a 31-day mean T and Q centered around the 50% date at Hells Gate. The 31-day model captures 90% or more of a run’s exposure to environmental conditions at Hells Gate and provides a better fit to the historical DBE data than environmental data averaged over a shorter time-period (Hague et al. 2007).\nThe model is run in WinBUGS (Spiegelhalter et al. 2003) with an R (R Core Team 2013) interface. This program allows the application of Bayesian methods to calculate the probability of the value of a parameter given the observed data (Wade 2000) and to provide an explicit expression of the amount of\n193\n\fIn-season Assessments: Environmental information\nuncertainty in these parameter estimates (Ellison 1996). As a result, it is also possible to quantify the uncertainty of the forecasted DBE and provide a probability interval (Ellison 1996) in addition to the point estimate for the forecasted DBE.\nEach management group has its own historical dataset and MA models are run separately for each group. This is because each management group experiences different conditions depending on when they migrate up the Fraser River. Early Stuart sockeye salmon often experience higher discharges due to freshet that might continue into early July. Early Summer-run sockeye salmon can experience both high discharges and high temperatures, as they start their migration while discharge might still be high due to late freshet, and they may migrate through the peak of high summer water temperatures in the Fraser River. Summer-run sockeye often experience high temperatures as they also migrate during the peak of summer; however, depending on their timing they might migrate when days are getting shorter and night cooling begins.\nThe current temperature and discharge models predict a DBE for each management group but do not incorporate stock specific information despite known differences in tolerances to adverse environmental conditions (Eliason et al. 2011). Stock-specific differences are addressed by reducing the number of years in the historical dataset used for predicting DBEs. For example, in Dominant or Subdominant Early South Thompson years, the Early Summer-run dataset might be reduced to only Dominant or Dominant and Subdominant years. Early South Thompson sockeye generally dominate the Early Summer run management group in Dominant and Subdominant years and it is believed that their response to environmental conditions would be better reflected by years in which they make up larger proportions of the Early Summer run. The datasets can also be reduced to odd years in pink salmon years and cycle line years. However, this generally reduces the data points and influences the fit of the model. Another method used to address stock-specific differences is the weighted pDBE approach described in Chapter B22.\nResults The temperature and discharge models produce prediction of the DBEs, including the 80% probability interval (PI), for Early Stuart, Early Summer and Summer run stocks for different Area 20 dates indicating the timing of the run (Table 1). In-season, the Area 20 date or marine migration date will be obtained from the run size assessment models (Chapter B19). Depending on the Area 20 migration date, the Hells Gate 50% date will differ and this in turn will impact the 19-days of temperature and discharge data used within the DBE model. For example, on August 21, the mean temperature and discharge when assuming the Area 20 timing is August 7, will be based on 19 days of observed data, 15 days observed prior to the Hells Gate date of August 17 and 3 days after. Because all of the 19 days of temperature and discharge data for this example are based on observations, no forecasts are needed to calculate the 19- day means. However, if the Hells Gate migration date is August 18, the 19-day mean used as input in the DBE model will be based on 18 days of observed data and one forecasted day (August 21). Thanks to the 10-day forecasts of temperature and discharge, DBE predictions can be made 3 to 4 days after the 50% migration date in Area 20. This allows the Fraser Panel to proactively adjust management actions to improve the probability of achieving spawning escapement goals and facilitates a more informed decision-making process.\n194\n\fIn-season Assessments: Environmental information\nTable 1. In-season table produced on 21 August 2018 containing the model predictions of expected percent Differences Between Estimates (%DBEs) and the implied proportional Management Adjustment (pMA). Depending on the assumed migration timing (Area 20 Date) of the management group, the 19 day mean temperature and discharge values will differ, resulting in different DBE predictions.\nModel evaluation DBE models and the derived Management Adjustment are used by managers to achieve spawning escapement targets while maximizing harvest. Underestimates of the DBE can lead to conservation concerns if excess catch causes too few fish to reach spawning grounds, whereas overestimates of DBE can result in foregone catch (Cummings et al. 2011). Various studies have evaluated the performance of the various DBE models (Cummings et al. 2011, Dionne et al. 2018) used to predict in-river loss. Cummings et al. (2011) found that although the best DBE models varied depending on the management group and performance measures, there was strong evidence that DBE forecasts and derived MA estimates based on some combination of environmental or biological data outperformed the approach of applying no MA at all.\nA study by Hague et al. (2008) examined whether data from lower Fraser River temperature and discharge stations are appropriate environmental indices for the basin as a whole. Adult salmon encounter a range of temperatures and discharges along their up-river migration route and these values may not be consistently well-correlated to lower river conditions, particularly for populations with natal spawning grounds &gt;500km from the ocean or for populations entering the river after mid-August. Results suggested that, in general, lower Fraser River environmental conditions were well correlated to conditions upriver; however, correlation strength decreased as a function of increasing distance and/or slower migration rates.\nPlanned Changes and Potential Areas for Improvement Given the cost to underestimating or overestimating DBEs, DFOs EWatch group and PSC staff continuously work to improve the models and tools used to estimate en-route loss (Patterson et al. 2019, Dionne et al. 2018).\nCurrently models and other tools are focused on the environmental impact on successful in-river migration to the spawning grounds. There is currently no way to forecast bias and imprecision in Mission escapement estimates, in-river catch estimates, spawning escapement estimates and stock composition.\n195\n\fIn-season Assessments: Environmental information\nReferences Cummings, J.W., Hague, M.J., Patterson, D.A., and Peterman, R.M. 2011.

DBE Run Timing Model and Upstream Migration Timing Model\nM.R. Forrest and M.J. Hague\nSummary Late run sockeye stocks excluding Birkenhead/Big Silver traditionally delay their migration to the Fraser River in the Strait of Georgia. Since 1995, these stocks have however entered the Fraser River earlier, resulting in extended freshwater residence times, exposure to higher river temperature and discharge; and increased mortality (Lapointe et al. 2003, Cooke et al. 2004). The 50% migration date at Mission captures the early migration behaviour and is used as a predictive tool in the DBE run timing model that relates the upstream migration timing to the migration success of these stocks, i.e. the difference between the predicted and the observed spawning escapement (difference between estimates, DBEs). DBE predictions based on the upstream migration should be available prior to observing all the late run sockeye upstream to be useful for marine fisheries management. Therefore, the upstream migration timing model uses the historic relationship between the proportion upstream migration to-date and upstream timing to predict the 50% migration date at Mission for Late run sockeye excluding Birkenhead/Big Silver.\nIntroduction Late run stocks excluding Birkenhead/Big Silver do not migrate immediately upstream. Instead, they hold in the Strait of Georgia close to the mouth of the river before initiating up-river migration. Since 1995, Late run sockeye arrive in the Strait of Georgia at the normal time but migrate up the river earlier than normal. There is a high mortality associated with this diverging behaviour resulting in a higher observed DBE (difference between estimates) between potential spawning escapement based on Mission estimates minus upstream catch and escapement on the spawning grounds (Macdonald et al. 2010). In order to mediate these en-route losses, additional fish are allowed to escape upriver of Mission to account for anticipated DBEs, i.e., differences between in-season versus post-season estimates of spawning escapement. The addition of fish to an escapement target for the purpose of increasing the likelihood of achieving the spawning escapement target (SET) is called the Management Adjustment (MA, Chapter B22). The Fraser River Panel relies on both in-season observations as well as DBE predictions to derive appropriate MA estimates. For Late-run sockeye excluding Birkenhead/Big Silver, the DBE run timing model in combination with the upstream migration timing model are used to predict the DBE. The DBE run timing model uses the relationship between the historical 50% migration date at Mission and the historical DBEs to make in-season DBE prediction. The in-season estimate of the upstream migration date in turn is derived through the upstream migration timing model for Late run sockeye excluding Birkenhead/Big Silver which relies on the historical relationship between the percentage of upstream migration to date and the 50% migration date at Mission. The percentage upstream migration to date indicates the proportion of the sockeye that continued their upstream migration into the Fraser River and the sockeye that made it to the Strait of Georgia (Area 29).\n198\n\fIn-season Assessments: Environmental information\nData The historical differences between estimates (DBEs) and Mission 50% migration dates for Late run sockeye are the primary data used in the DBE run timing model. Birkenhead/Big Silver stocks are excluded from the Late run DBE and 50% migration data because they do not delay their upstream migration. The Mission 50% migration timing relates to the date when 50% of the run will have passed Mission. Additional data used to predict the upstream migration timing for Late-run excluding Birkenhead/Big Silver are the reconstructed abundance estimates of these stocks in the Strait of Georgia. Forward reconstructions predict abundances into the Strait of Georgia based on marine daily abundances derived from stock-specific catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) data and historical catchability estimates of marine test fisheries combined with assumptions about migration speed (Chapter B18). Dividing the total upstream migration to date by the total reconstructed abundance in the Strait of Georgia to date gives an estimate of the proportion of upstream migration to date.\nMethods The DBE run timing model uses Mission timing as a predictive variable to predict the DBE. The DBE is expressed as ln(PSE/SE), whereby PSE is the potential spawning escapement and SE is the actual spawning escapement. The log transformation is required to meet the assumptions of homoscedasticity (Zar 1996) and to restrict predictions to positive numbers. Upstream timing is described by the Mission 50% migration date. Higher (more negative) DBEs are associated with early upstream migration (Figure 1).\nFigure 1. Relationship between %DBE and the Mission 50% migration date for Late Run sockeye excluding Birkenhead/Big Silver.\nIn-season, the Mission 50% migration date is predicted by the upstream timing model. This model looks at the historical relationship between the proportion of upstream migration to date and the post-season 50% migration date for Late-run excluding Birkenhead/Big Silver (Figure 2). The dependent value for the upstream timing model is the 50% date at Mission. The predictive variable is the percentage of resident fish reconstructed into the Strait of Georgia which have migrated past Mission on a given date. Earlier in the season, predictions of upstream migration timing are more uncertain (lower R2) compared to later in the season. The higher the proportion of upstream migration to date, the more precise the timing estimate. Uncertainty around the upstream timing will impact the uncertainty around the resulting DBE predictions.\n199\n\fIn-season Assessments: Environmental information\nFigure 2. Example of the relationship between the 50% date at Mission and the percentage of resident fish reconstructed into the Gulf which have migrated past Mission on a given date.\nThe DBE run timing and upstream migration timing models incorporate uncertainty through the application Bayesian estimation methods. Rather than providing the Fraser River Panel with a fixed DBE prediction or 50% migration date at Mission through frequentist statistics, the use of Bayesian methods allows the quantification of the uncertainty associated with the predictions (Ellison 1996). The Bayesian regression models are run in Winbugs (Spiegelhalter et al. 2003) with an R-code interface (R Core Team 2013).\nMODEL EVALUATION\nDBE models and the derived Management Adjustment are used by managers to achieve spawning escapement targets while maximizing harvest. Underestimates of in-river loss can lead to conservation concerns if excess catch causes too few fish to reach spawning grounds, whereas overestimates of in- river loss can result in foregone catch (Cummings et al. 2011). Various studies have evaluated the performance of the DBE model (Cummings et al. 2011, Dionne et al. 2018) used to predict in-river loss for Late run sockeye excluding Birkenhead/Big Silver. Cummings et al. (2011) found that MA forecast based on the DBE model outperformed applying no MA at all.\nCummings et al. (2011) ranked the DBE run timing model for Late run sockeye as the best in terms of hind cast criteria. This model performed better than models relying on temperature and discharge. But the in-season uncertainty associated with the Mission migration date reduces the reliability of the resulting DBE predictions. When the Late-run run-size is small, estimating delay can be even more difficult.\nPlanned Changes and Potential Areas for Improvement The DFO EWatch group and PSC staff continue to work at improving the models and tools used to estimate en-route loss given the cost to underestimate or overestimate in-river losses.\nReferences Cooke, S.J., Hinch, S.G., Farrell, A.P., Lapointe, M.F., Jones, S.R.M., Macdonald, J.S., Patterson, D.A.

Total Allowable Catch (TAC)\nF.J. Martens\nSummary Available Total Allowable Catch (TAC) is an important pre-requisite for in-season fisheries. The Pacific Salmon Treaty (PST), Chapter 4, describes the calculations for TAC for Fraser River sockeye and pink salmon. TAC is calculated as the remaining portion of the annual aggregated Fraser River sockeye and pink salmon abundance available after the spawning escapement target, the Management Adjustment (sockeye only), the agreed Fraser River Aboriginal Fisheries Exemption (AFE, sockeye only) and the expected catch in Panel-authorized test fisheries are deducted. If there is a remaining portion of sockeye or pink salmon run size available for harvest in Fraser Panel Area waters, the United States (U.S.) share shall not exceed 16.5 percent of the TAC for sockeye salmon and not exceed 25.7 percent of the TAC for pink salmon. This calculation is subject to adjustments for harvest overages or underages from previous years based on post-season catch estimates (see Chapter 4 Para 8(a to d) for details). The remaining TAC in addition to AFE catches are assigned to Canada. This report also describes the TAC-related decisions involving sockeye directed fisheries.\nIntroduction While the Fraser River Panel’s primary objective is to reach Spawning Escapement Targets (SET) for individual sockeye and pink salmon management units (MUs), its second objective is to achieve international allocation of the Total Allowable Catch (TAC) for both species (PST, Chapter 4). The Treaty states that the U.S. share of the annual Fraser River sockeye and pink salmon Total Allowable Catch (TAC) will not exceed 16.5 and 25.7 percent of the sockeye and pink salmon TAC, respectively. The remaining available catch is deemed Canada’s share. The following document describes in detail the TAC calculation as well as further adjustments and other considerations.\nTAC CALCULATIONS\nThe four main deductions for calculating the TAC include the Spawning Escapement Target (Chapter A4), the Management Adjustments (sockeye only) (Chapter B22), the Aboriginal Fisheries Exemption (sockeye only) and the Panel approved test fishing catch (Chapter A5) (Table 1). Annually, Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) provides escapement targets and a sockeye spawning escapement plan for each management group (MU) as per Chapter 4, paragraph 3 of the PST. For each MU, the TAM (Total Allowable Mortality) rules that account for both fishing and natural mortality due to adverse environmental conditions are incorporated to ensure sufficient fish reach the spawning grounds. Although the TAM rule defines the target levels, these levels can be further increased if the Panel decides there are other competing factors that would preclude the SETs from being reached. These factors are natural, environmental or stock assessment factors and for the purposes of the TAC calculation are referred to as Management Adjustments (MAs, MacDonald et al. 2010). MAs are additional fish added to the SET for the purpose of increasing the likelihood of achieving the SET. When the SET is increased by the MA, the resulting target is referred to as the adjusted SET (Table 1). In case the sum of the SET and MA exceeds the forecasted or in-season estimated run size, the adjusted SET is capped to match that run size estimate (e.g. in the case of Early Stuart in 2018). For pink salmon the escapement plan provided by DFO does not change based on in-season migration conditions.\n202\n\fIn-season Assessments: Fisheries Assessment\nTable 1. An example of a detailed calculation of total allowable catch (TAC) and achievement of international catch shares for Fraser sockeye salmon by management group in 2018.\nIn addition to the adjusted SET, the Treaty also defines an Aboriginal Fisheries Exemption (AFE) of up to 400,000 sockeye, set aside for Canadian in-river and marine area Aboriginal fisheries (i.e. for First Nations opportunities to harvest salmon for Food, Social and Ceremonial (FSC) purposes). The AFE is also deducted from the total run size prior to determining the TAC for international sharing.

For Early Stuart the exemption is up to 20% of the AFE, and the AFE for the remaining management groups is based on the average proportional distribution of First Nations harvests for the most recent three cycles, modified annually as required. If pre-season or in-season there is insufficient harvestable surplus in any management group to allow achieving the AFE allocation for that management group, then the AFE distribution is adjusted so that AFE for that management group is the greater of the catch, the projected catch by Aboriginal fisheries or the available harvestable surplus. Lastly, any test fishing catch from Panel approved test fisheries is also removed from the total run size when calculating the available TAC for international sharing. There are no MAs or AFEs for pink salmon.\nOnce the TAC is defined for each of the four MUs, the U.S. share is based on the aggregate TAC, i.e., across the four MUs. To the extent practicable, the Panel shall develop and implement a fishing plan that provides the U.S. fishery with the opportunity to harvest its 16.5 percent aggregate share of the TAC of Fraser River sockeye and its 25.7 percent share of the Fraser River pink salmon TAC. To accomplish this, the Panel shall take into consideration the availability of both the sockeye salmon TAC and pink salmon TAC, through the entire fishing season, while to the extent practical, minimizing the impacts on overlapping of sockeye management groups with little or no TAC. To do this the Panel strives to develop and implement fishing plans that concentrate U.S. fisheries on the most abundant MU(s), i.e., the ones that provide the largest percentage of the available TAC. To the extent practicable the harvest should be distributed evenly across the available TAC for each MU however, given that the proportion of migration of different MUs through U.S. waters on any given year may be variable, this may result in more than 16.5 percent of the TAC for one or more of the less abundant MUs (see Chapter 4 Para 3e for details). In addition, some of the less abundant management groups may even have no TAC. To allow access to the TAC of the more abundant management group, some incidental harvest may occur on the overlapping MUs that may have little or no TAC. Bycatch on a MU with little or no TAC is defined by the low abundance exploitation rate (LAER) which limits the exploitation rate of that group to a small amount (%) as defined by Canada’s preseason spawning escapement plan. Managing to a LAER situation typically occurs for one of the following reasons: when the run size is below the lower fisheries reference point (Pestal et al. 2008), when the adjusted SET (SET + MA) is greater than the run size or when the adjusted SET is less than the run size, but the resulting TAC is small enough for the exploitation rate to be less than the LAER. For example, in 2018 there was no international TAC for Early Stuart sockeye, but fisheries on Early Summer run resulted in a small catch of Early Stuart fish in U.S. fisheries (Table 1). This by-catch was still below the defined LAER of 10% for the Early Stuart management group in 2018.\nADJUSTMENTS TO TAC CALCULATIONS\nAdjustments are made to the U.S. share of the TAC in the case of previous-year(s) harvest overages (more fish caught than allocated share) or underages (less fish caught than allocated share from the previous year(s) (see Chapter 4 Para 8(a to b) for details). Currently, there are no adjustments for overages that are a result of TAC reductions after the scheduling of the last Panel approved U.S. fishery of the season or for any harvest of Fraser River sockeye that occurs in Alaska (see Chapter 4 Para 8(c to d) for details). Adjustments for underages are made if Canada directly impedes the US from obtaining its share of the TAC, but not because the U.S. failed to deploy sufficient effort or fish were not accessible to U.S. fisheries due to northern migration patterns or harvesting constraints. Adjustments, for previous year overages or underages, are limited so that the resulting TAC is not reduced by more than 5% or increased by more than 15% unless the Panel deems otherwise. If in a given year there is an overage or underage, from a previous season, to be carried forward but no available TAC, by Panel agreement, the overage or underage is carried forward to the subsequent year(s). Any residual overage or underage on\n204\n\fIn-season Assessments: Fisheries Assessment\nthe last year of the Chapter (i.e., 2028) will be carried forward to the next Chapter Period. Reasons for adjustments include the following: (1) management imprecision in U.S. fisheries (2) Canada impeding the U.S. from pursuing its in-season share.\nOTHER TAC CONSIDERATIONS\nCurrently, the Panel considers four different sockeye management groups (Early Stuart, Early Summer, Summer and Late run) to derive SETs and the aggregated TAC. The Panel can however assign additional management groups by mutual decision (Chapter 4 para 2f of PST). For example, prior to 2010, the Birkenhead group formed a fifth management group. Should additional management groups be assigned, then the TAC calculation applies in a similar fashion as for the four management groups.\nAs agreed to by the Parties in Chapter 4 of the Treaty, Alaska District 104 catches are excluded from the TAC calculation. Fraser River sockeye incidentally caught in District 104 fisheries directed at pink salmon comprise a small portion of the catch in that fishery and are not considered to be the target species/stock. As a result, this catch is not included in the TAC calculation but is included in the post- season estimate of total run size.\nESSR catch (escapement surplus to spawning requirement) is also excluded from the TAC table. This is catch from a Canadian fishery that occurs in terminal areas (e.g., Weaver Creek sockeye). As these fish are ‘in excess’ of the spawning requirement (Garner and Parfitt 2006), they are not included in the exploitation rate as this would unnecessarily inflate the exploitation rate and indicate an inaccurate portrayal of in-season management of harvest. As a result, this catch is not included in the Canadian catch in the TAC table (DFO 1999).\nIn addition to the Alaska and ESSR catch not included in the TAC calculation, Fisheries Induced Mortalities (FIMs) are also not included (Michielsens et al. 2019). FIMs are a component of the catch that is released (non-retention), and some of these released fish are expected to die due to the stress of capture and handling. Although the mortality associated with this catch is not included in the TAC calculation it is included for the calculation of the exploitation rate which may limit access to TAC.\nFISHERIES EVALUATIONS IN RELATION TO SOCKEYE TAC\nAvailable TAC is an important pre-requisite for in-season fisheries. Once the panel adopts in-season run size and MA estimates for the different management groups, the TAC table (Figure 1) is adjusted to take into account the newly adjusted SETs. In addition, updated catch numbers in the TAC table will include both catches of fisheries that have concluded as well as preliminary catch estimates for ongoing fisheries. The remaining available TAC for sockeye will determine if additional sockeye directed fisheries will be allowed to take place. When there is TAC available for all fisheries management groups impacted by the proposed fishery, TAC is the main consideration. In case there is no TAC for one of the overlapping management groups, this group will be managed under a LAER, and for a U.S. fishery under this scenario to be approved, the resulting catches of the U.S fisheries proposal should be deemed small but acceptable by the parties.\nReferences DFO 1999.

Evaluation of benchmarks for conservation units in Canada’s Wild\nSalmon Policy: Technical Documentation. DFO Can. Sci. Advis. Sec. Res. Doc. 2009/059. x + 50 p.\nABSTRACT\nCanada’s Wild Salmon Policy requires that quantifiable metrics of biological status and benchmarks along those metrics that delineate Red, Amber, and Green zones of status be established for all Conservation Units. Although candidate benchmarks have been identified from the scientific literature and previous management experience, they have not been evaluated in terms of their ability to meet the goals of the Wild Salmon Policy. Using a simulation model, we evaluated lower benchmarks on two classes of indicators (abundances and fishing mortality relative to productivity) on two performance metrics: the probability of extirpation over the long term and the probability of recovery to a target. This technical document provides the methodology and results for those analyses and is a companion document to the overall synthesis paper “Indicators of Status and Benchmarks for Conservation Units in Canada’s Wild Salmon Policy” (Holt et al. 2009). We considered the “worst-case” management scenario, with management decisions corresponding to CUs being depleted to the lower benchmark each year. Although unrealistic, this assumption provides an upper limit on the probability of extirpation and lower limit on the probability of recovery. We found that for metrics of spawner abundances, the lower benchmark, spawner abundance that will result in recovery to SMSY (spawner abundance at maximum sustained yield) in one generation under equilibrium conditions (Sgen), was associated with a relatively low probability of extirpation (probability &lt;25%) over 100 years (for populations with equilibrium abundances &gt; 15 000 spawners) and high probability of recovery to SMSY within three generations (probability &gt;75%) when uncertainties in all major components of the fishery system were accounted for. Furthermore, the probability of extirpation for Sgen was more robust to variability in stock productivity compared with benchmarks calculated from proportions of SMSY. For metrics of fishing mortality, the lower benchmark FMSY (fishing mortality at maximum sustained yield) was associated with a relatively low probability of extirpation (probability &lt;25%) over 100 years for populations with equilibrium abundances &gt; 30 000 spawners, and high probability of recovery to SMSY within three generations (probability &gt;75%), and its performance was more robust to variability in stock productivity than other benchmarks on fishing mortality derived from the scientific literature. Based on those results and a risk classification scheme developed in DFO’s Fishery Decision-Making Framework Incorporating the Precautionary Approach (2009), we suggest deriving lower benchmarks on spawner abundances from Sgen and lower benchmarks on fishing mortality from FMSY. Further work will be required to identify specific risk tolerances of stakeholders in order to better inform the choice of lower benchmarks.\nxi\n\fRÉSUMÉ\nLa Politique concernant le saumon sauvage du Canada exige que des paramètres quantifiables pour évaluer l’état biologique ainsi que des points de repère pour délimiter les trois zones d’état (rouge, ambre et vert) soient établis pour toutes les unités de conservation. Bien que des points de repère probables aient été déterminés à partir de l’examen de la documentation scientifique et d’une expérience de gestion précédente, ils n’ont pas fait l’objet d’une évaluation sur le plan de leur capacité à atteindre les objectifs visés par la Politique concernant le saumon sauvage. Au moyen d’un modèle de simulation, on a évalué les points de repère inférieurs de deux catégories d’indicateurs (l’abondance et la mortalité par pêche relativement à la productivité) pour deux paramètres liés à la performance : la probabilité de disparition d’un endroit donné à long terme et la probabilité de rétablissement correspondant à un objectif. Ce document technique présente la méthode et les résultats de ces analyses et est un document d’accompagnement à l’ouvrage de synthèse générale intitulé « Indicators of Status and Benchmarks for Conservation Units in Canada’s Wild Salmon Policy » (Holt et coll., 2009). On a envisagé le pire scénario de gestion avec des décisions de gestion correspondant aux unités de conservation étant appauvries au point de repère inférieur chaque année. Bien qu’elle soit peu réaliste, cette hypothèse procure un seuil supérieur relatif à la probabilité de disparition et un seuil inférieur relatif à la probabilité de rétablissement. En ce qui concerne les paramètres de l’abondance de reproducteurs, on a découvert que le point de repère le plus bas, l’abondance de reproducteurs qui se traduira par le rétablissement à SMSY (abondance de reproducteurs au rendement maximal soutenable) en une génération dans des conditions d’équilibre (Sgen), était associé à une probabilité relativement faible de disparition (probabilité &lt; 25 %) sur 100 ans (pour les populations affichant un niveau d’abondance équilibré &gt; 15 000 reproducteurs) et une forte probabilité de rétablissement à SMSY en trois générations (probabilité &gt; 75 %), lorsqu’on tenait compte des incertitudes liées à toutes les composantes principales du système de pêche. De plus, la probabilité de disparition pour Sgen était davantage liée à la variabilité de productivité du stock comparativement aux points de repère calculés à partir des proportions de SMSY. Quant aux paramètres relatifs à la mortalité par pêche, le point de repère inférieur FMSY (mortalité par pêche au rendement maximal soutenable) était associé à une probabilité relativement faible de disparition (probabilité &lt; 25 %) sur plus de 100 ans pour des populations affichant un niveau d’abondance équilibré &gt; 30 000 reproducteurs, et une forte probabilité de rétablissement à SMSY en trois générations (probabilité &gt; 75 %), et sa performance était davantage liée à la variabilité de productivité du stock que les autres points de repère relatifs à la mortalité par pêche issus des documents scientifiques. À partir de ces résultats et d’un schéma de classification fondée sur le risque élaboré en vertu du cadre décisionnel pour les pêches intégrant l’approche de précaution (2009) du MPO, on suggère de calculer les points de repère inférieurs pour l’abondance de reproducteurs à partir de Sgen et les points de repère inférieurs pour la mortalité par pêche à partir de FMSY. Des études supplémentaires seront nécessaires afin de déterminer la tolérance particulière à l’égard des risques des intervenants dans le but de mieux définir le choix des points de repère inférieurs.\nxii\n\f1.\nINTRODUCTION\nNumerous lower benchmarks have been proposed to assess status of Conservation Units for the Wild Salmon Policy, but those benchmarks have not been evaluated in a consistent, probabilistic way (i.e., incorporating uncertainties). To evaluate the performance of lower benchmarks, we adapted the nine steps identified in the idealized assessment framework for identifying benchmarks (Table 1). Specifically, using a simulation modelling approach, we compared the performances of benchmarks on two criteria derived from the Wild Salmon Policy, the probability of extirpation over the long term and the probability that the CU will rebuild to levels where harvest can provide, on an average annual basis, the maximum annual catch, given existing environmental conditions (i.e., probability of recovery to SMSY). We did this by developing an operating model, which is a mathematical abstraction of the true fisheries system accounting for all known uncertainties. In the operating model, we assumed the most aggressive harvest strategy possible that still recognized the lower benchmark (i.e., that was associated with the highest possible probability of extirpation and lowest possible probability of recovery). In other words, the harvest strategy was associated with the worst-case performance. For the benchmarks on fishing mortality, that harvest strategy was a constant fishing mortality policy equivalent to the lower benchmark (see Section 1.3 for more details). For benchmarks on spawner abundances, the harvest strategy was a constant escapement policy equivalent to the lower benchmark, with one exception when evaluating the probability of recovery to a target (as described in Section 1.3). All other possible harvest strategies that recognize those lower benchmarks but adapt escapement or fishing mortality according to observed abundances or catches above that benchmark, will result in improved performance (a lower probability of extirpation and higher probability of recovery). Although these harvest strategies may be unrealistic, they demonstrate the long-term properties of the benchmarks under pessimistic assumptions about the ability of fishery management to restrict effort. Therefore, the simulation model results represent a lower limit on possible performance. Evaluating all possible harvest strategies in a simulation model is beyond the scope of this report, but will be a necessary step before implementing those rules in the fishery.\n1\n\fTable 1 Steps for determining a precautionary lower benchmark in an idealized assessment framework for an example reference frame (biological yield) and goal (maintenance of maximum yield).

Uncertainties were incorporated in two ways. First, the simulation model was iterated over Monte Carlo trials to generate distributions of abundances in each year instead of point values. Second, the “base-case” simulation model was rerun according to different assumptions about parameter values and model structure (including assumptions about relationship between spawner abundances and recruitment, degree of depensatory mortality at low spawner abundances, trends in productivity, magnitude of observation errors, length of historical time series used to estimate benchmarks, and deviations between target and realized harvest rates). In this way, we evaluated how robust the performances of the lower benchmarks were to violations in the base-case assumptions.\n2\n\f1.2 Candidate lower benchmarks\nWe evaluated lower benchmarks derived from previous management experience and the scientific literature (see Holt et al. 2009) on two classes of indicators: spawner abundances and fishing mortality relative to productivity. The benchmarks reflected a gradient in size from less precautionary (e.g., at low spawner abundances or high fishing mortality, where only very depleted CUs were classified in the red zone) to more precautionary (e.g., at high spawner abundances or low fishing mortality, where moderately depleted CUs were classified in the red zone) (Table 2).\nTable 2.

For example, for lower benchmarks on spawner abundances, to estimate the probability of extirpation over the long term (the first performance criteria), we assumed a constant escapement policy equivalent to the lower benchmark and ran the simulation over 100 years. Similarly, to estimate the probability of extirpation for lower benchmarks on fishing mortality, we assumed a constant harvest rate policy equivalent to the benchmark over 100 years. To evaluate the probability of recovery to a target (the second performance criteria) for benchmarks on spawner abundances, we set population abundances to the lower benchmark at the beginning of the simulation, and instead of a constant escapement policy, we assumed no commercial or recreational fishing (e.g., fishing from test fisheries and by-catch from other fisheries only) over one (or three) generations (the constant escapement policy resulted in almost no recovery and therefore gave non-informative comparisons among benchmarks). To evaluate the probability of recovery to a target for benchmarks on fishing mortality, we assumed fishing mortality equivalent to the lower benchmark over the same time period.\n4\n\f Table 3 Information required to evaluate lower benchmarks in the idealized assessment framework (described in Table 1) on two criteria: probability of extirpation (columns 2 and 3) and probability of recovery (columns 4 and 5), and for two classes of indicators: those based on spawner abundances (columns 2 and 4) and based on fishing mortality relative to productivity (columns 3 and 5).

We describe Model 1 in Sections 2.1.1 to 2.1.4, and then describe how Model 2 differs from Model 1 in Section 2.1.5. All variables and parameters are defined in Table 4. Model 1 had four components: a population dynamics sub-model (Box 1 of Figure 1a), an observation sub-model (Box 2), a management sub-model (Box 3), and a performance module (Box 4). The population dynamics, observation, and management sub-models were repeated over 100 years and 500 Monte Carlo trials (the number required to stabilize output metrics).\nTable 4.

Specifically, spawner abundance in brood year y, Sy, was used to calculate\n9\n\frecruitment resulting from that spawning, Ry, using a Ricker model with lognormally distributed random variation, and autocorrelation in residuals with a one-year time lag:\n(Eqn. 1)\nR\ny\n\neS y\na\n1(\n\nS\n/ y b\n)\n y\n,\n\ny\ny\n1\n\ny\n,\nv\n ,0N~\n2  , v\nwhere a is the productivity parameter (loge (recruits/spawner) at low spawner abundances), b is spawner abundances at replacement (or equilibrium),  describes autocorrelated variability in recruitment,  is the autocorrelation coefficient, and describes the stochastic deviations in recruitment.\nWe included depensatory mortality at low abundances as described in Holt (2007). Below a lower threshold (S* = 500 spawners), recruitment that accounted for depensation (Rdep,y) declined more rapidly as spawner abundances declined than if depensation was ignored (i.e., when Ry was derived from Eqn. 1):\n(Eqn. 2)\nR\ndep\n,\ny\n\nR\ny\n\n1\n\n   \nS\n\n\n\n\nS\ny\nS\n\n\n\n   \n, for Sy &lt; S*\nThose reductions in recruitment were curvilinear with steepest rates of change immediately below S* and an asymptote near zero spawners (of zero recruits). Although evidence for depensatory mortality at low abundances is weak for most species and stocks of Pacific salmon, it has been documented at abundances higher than 500 spawners (our threshold, S*) in some cases (e.g., 7000 spawners, Cultus Lake sockeye salmon, M. Bradford, pers. comm. Cooperative Resource Management Institute, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, B.C.). We therefore varied the lower threshold below which depensation occurred in a sensitivity analysis. An alternative approach to modelling depensation is to offset the spawner- recruitment model to the right by the abundance of spawners below which depensatory mortality results in zero recruitment (Chen et al., 2002). However, in contrast to the approach described in Eqns. (1) and (2), for the method of Chen et al. (2002), the predicted recruitment above the depensation threshold (or offset amount) varies depending on whether depensation at low spawner abundances is accounted for or ignored. To isolate the effects of depensation at low spawners only, we used the method described in Eqns. (1) and (2). The assumptions associated with the base case and all sensitivity analyses are described in Table 5.\n10\n\fTable 5. Assumptions of the “base-case” model, and variations to those assumptions applied in the sensitivity analyses. “Sub-model” pertains to where that assumption is made in the operating model, as described in Figure 1. Note, some sensitivity analyses were performed on only a subset of model scenarios (e.g., the last sensitivity analysis was performed only on benchmarks of spawner abundances, because for benchmarks based on fishing mortality, management actions were derived from pre-specified F values).

The values of those parameters were selected so that SMSY and harvest rate at MSY for each model were equivalent to those for the base-case Ricker model.\nWe assumed the productivity parameter of the stock-recruitment relationship was constant over time, but included normally distributed variability in that parameter over Monte Carlo trials (mean a=1.5, equivalent to approximately 4.5 recruits/spawners at low spawners, sd =0.3). In a sensitivity analyses, we investigated the effects of constant low productivity (mean a = 0.5, or 1.6 recruits/spawner) and high productivity (mean a = 2.0, or 7.4 recruits/spawner) on the relative performance of benchmarks. We further investigated the effects of three time trends in productivity: a linear increase, a linear decrease, and a sinusoidal pattern with a period of 20 years and amplitude of 1.0 loge(recruits/spawner). We varied the spawner abundances at equilibrium (b parameter) in fixed intervals of 1000 spawners between 1000 and 100 000 fish (i.e., the model was run separately for populations of different carrying capacities). This allowed us to compare results under various combinations ((3+3)  100 = 600) of productivity (a) and spawner abundances at equilibrium (b).\n12\n\fNatural variation in the proportion at each age-at-maturity pg, in return year t, was incorporated into the population dynamics model using a multivariate logistic distribution (Schnute and Richards, 1995):\nx\n, tg\ne G  \ng\n1\n,\nx\n, tg\ne\n(Eqn. 6)\np\ntg ,\n\nwhere,\n(Eqn. 7)\nx\ntg ,\n\nlog\n(\np\ng\ne\n)\n\n\ntg ,\n\n1 G\nG\n\ng\n1 \n log\n(\np\ng\ne\n)\n\n\ntg ,\n\n,\nG is the oldest age class,\ngp is the mean proportions at age,  is the standard deviation in the multivariate logistic distribution of proportions at age, and g,t are standard normal gp and  were estimated from historical data (described in the Model deviates. Both Parameterization sub-section below). Spawner abundances were initialized at 1000 spawners.\n2.1.2 Observation sub-model\nUncertainty in observations of recruitment come from many sources, including errors in visual observations of spawner abundance (e.g., visual observations from stream walks or aerial surveys), sampling variability of spawners and catches, and uncertainty in non-harvest mortality during return migration. The observed number of recruits, R0, in year t, was calculated from the true number of recruits, Rt, with multiplicative, lognormally distributed random variability, as in (Cass et al., 2003),\n(Eqn. 8)\nR\n,0 t\n teR t\n,\n\n ,0N~\n2 \n,\nwhere  is normally distributed random variability with a standard deviation, .\nTo properly parameterize natural process variation in recruitment () (Eqn. 1) and observation error () (Eqn. 8), we needed to partition variability from those two specific sources from the total observed variability in recruitment. Historical recruitment data used to estimate parameters in equation 1 contained both natural process variation and observation error; hence recruitment calculated from these equations also contained both  and . To separate the various contributors to total variability, we used a simple simulation model to estimate the standard deviations of the natural process variation,  (equations 1), which, in combination with observation errors (), resulted in standard deviations in total recruitment equal to those observed historically (). Note that those variances were not  indicating that the sources of variability were not additive (i.e.,  independent. We found that the total combined uncertainty () was swamped by large natural variability in recruitment. Specifically, the standard deviation in natural process\n≠ \n\n13\n\fvariation was equal to 94% of the standard deviation in total combined recruitment for both stocks (i.e., = 0.94).\n2.1.3 Management sub-model\nManagement actions were simulated in two parts, (1) the selection of a management target based on a constant escapement policy equivalent to the lower benchmark on spawner abundances or constant harvest rate equivalent to the lower benchmark on fishing mortality (Table 2), and (2) the implementation of that target including outcome uncertainty, i.e., uncertainty in the outcomes of implementing a harvest strategy (Holt and Peterman, 2006).\nBenchmarks related to SMSY or FMSY cannot be estimated exactly due to observation errors in abundances, sampling variability, and model misspecification, among other factors. To account for those uncertainties, we identified benchmarks using parameter estimates of the spawner-recruitment relationship derived from simulated historical data. Specifically, for every Monte Carlo trial in the overall simulation model, we simulated 20 years of historical data in a separate sub-model (i.e., separate from the models used to evaluate lower benchmarks) assuming a Ricker spawner-recruitment with the same parameters used in the population dynamics sub-model for that Monte Carlo trial, and a harvest rate of 70% (to represent a heavily exploited stock) with beta-distributed variability in outcomes (Box 3a, Fig. 1). Maximum likelihood techniques were then used to estimate parameters of the Ricker spawner-recruitment relationship (a, b and  ), as well as the lower benchmark. By using short time-series of simulated data to estimate parameters, we were able to produce the commonly observed positive bias in productivity (Walters and Martell, 2004). In a sensitivity analysis, we increased the number of years of data simulated to estimate parameters from 20 to 30 in order to evaluate the effects of increased historical information on the performance of benchmarks.\nTo improve estimation of the capacity parameter (“b” of the stock-recruitment relationship), we included prior information on that parameter, which, in practice, can be generated from freshwater capacity studies or landscape characteristics (Parken et al., 2006; Shortreed et al., 2001). Specifically, a penalty was added to the likelihood function, which was drawn from a log-normal distribution with a mean equal to the true value and a standard deviation of 0.6, in units of loge(1000 spawners). Estimates of “b” that were far from the true value were penalized inversely proportional to that distribution.\nFor lower benchmarks on spawner abundances, target harvest rates in return year t,\nht, were calculated from observed recruitment, RO,t, and the escapement goal, Et,\n(Eqn. 9)\nh t\n1 \n/ RE t\n, tO\n.\nFor lower benchmarks on fishing mortality, FL, target harvest rates were calculated using the standard equation to convert natural logarithms (F) to a proportion between 0 and 1 (h): (Eqn. 10)\n 1 e\n.\nLF\nh t\n14\n\fTarget harvest rates are rarely achieved exactly because of variability in the catchability of fish, non-compliance to fishing regulations, and management pressures that cause decisions to deviate from those that achieve targets, among other factors (Holt et al. 2006). To account for those uncertainties, we included random variation in the outcomes of harvest rates assuming a beta-distribution of errors (as described in Holt and Peterman (2008)).\n2.1.4 Performance module\nIn the performance module, we evaluated the probability of extirpation (i.e., populations where spawner abundances &lt; 100 fish in four consecutive years) by computing the proportion of Monte Carlo trials where populations met that criterion.\n2.1.5 Differences between Models 1 and 2\nThe model used to evaluate probability of recovery to a target (Model 2) differed from Model 1 in four ways. First, the spawner abundances at equilibrium was set to a single value, 10,000 spawners instead of multiple values between 1000 and 100,000, because preliminary results suggested that probability of recovery was independent of spawner abundances at equilibrium. Second, for candidate benchmarks on spawner abundances, spawners were initialized at the lower benchmark instead of 1000 fish so that the recovery from the lower benchmark could be evaluated. For candidate benchmarks on fishing mortality, spawners were instead initialized at 10% of spawner abundances at equilibrium. Third, for candidate benchmarks on spawner abundances, we assumed no commercial or recreational fishing. We assumed the unavoidable harvest (e.g., due to test fisheries and by- catch from other fisheries, among other sources), ht, was 0.1, but this value was varied in a sensitivity analysis, ht= 0.02 and ht= 0.2. Although those harvest rates are not management targets, we included outcome uncertainty in those values to simulate interannual variability in non-commercial, non-recreational harvest. For candidate benchmarks on fishing mortality, the target harvest rate was set to the lower benchmark on fishing mortality and also included outcome uncertainty. Fourth, in the performance module, we evaluated the probability of recovery to SMSY in one and three generation(s), instead probability of extirpation over 100 years, by computing the proportion of Monte Carlo trials where populations rebuilt to above SMSY in at least one year over that time period.\n2.2 Model parameterization\nThe parameters in Equations 1, 6, and 7 were estimated from historical data on Early Stuart sockeye salmon (K. Benner, pers. comm., Fisheries and Oceans Canada, 985 McGill Place, Kamloops, B.C., V2C 6X6) (Table 4), with the exception of the productivity and capacity parameters (“a” and “b”) in Equation 1, which are as described in the “Population dynamics sub-model” and “Observation sub-model” sub-sections. Although our base-case represents one species in one region (sockeye salmon in the Fraser River) our extensive sensitivity analyses cover characteristics of stocks and species with alternative stock-recruitment relationships (e.g., models with and without depensation and\n15\n\fautocorrelation, Beverton-Holt model, and Larkin model) and scenarios about observations, assessments, and management.\nThe magnitude of observation errors was derived from mark-recapture studies on sockeye spawner abundances in Chilko Lake between 2001 and 2004 (T. Whitehouse pers. comm. Fisheries and Oceans Canada, 985 McGill Place, Kamloops, B.C., V2C 6X6) (standard deviation in observation error, , = 0.19). Although uncertainties in catch estimates and non-harvest mortality are not included in that estimate, we increased  in a sensitivity analysis to twice that value ( = 0.38), a rough upper estimate of the magnitude of the total observation errors in recruitment.\nParameters describing outcome uncertainty were for Summer-Run sockeye salmon on the Fraser River, as estimated by Holt and Peterman (2006) (standard deviation between realized and target mortality rates = 0.097). In a sensitivity analysis, we increased the magnitude of those uncertainties to those observed for Late-Summer run sockeye (standard deviation = 0.19) (Holt and Peterman, 2006), a stock with relatively large deviations between target and realized mortality rates.\n\nRESULTS\n\nFirst we present results on Model 1 (the probability of extirpation over the long term) and then Model 2 (the probability of recovery to SMSY within one (or three) generations). Within each model, we first evaluate lower benchmarks on spawner abundances, and then lower benchmarks on fishing mortality.\n3.1 Model 1: Probability of extirpation over the long term\n3.1.1 Lower benchmarks on spawner abundances\nWhen populations were projected forward under constant escapement policies equivalent to lower benchmarks derived from S at 40-90% of RMSY (black lines labeled 40- 90% Figure 2), S at 50% of RMAX (red line), 40% of SMSY (blue line), and Sgen (green line), probabilities of extirpation were low or very low (probabilities &lt;25% or &lt;5%, respectively, definitions adapted from DFO’s “Fishery decision-making framework incorporating the Precautionary Approach”(2009)) when equilibrium abundances were &gt; 15,000 fish (right side of Figure 2). Below that equilibrium abundance (left side of Figure 2), probabilities of extirpation were higher or rose steeply for all benchmarks. When we assumed populations were highly productive (mean Ricker “a” value = 2.0, equivalent to 7.4 recruits/spawner at low spawner abundances), probabilities of extirpation tended to be lower for most benchmarks (Figure 3c) compared with the moderate productivity case (Figure 3b). In other words, highly productive populations were better able to rebound from occasional poor recruitment years than less-productive populations. In contrast, when we assumed populations were relatively unproductive (mean Ricker “a” value = 0.5, equivalent to 1.6 recruits/spawner and low spawner abundances), probabilities of extirpation tended to be higher for most benchmarks. The differences among productivity scenarios were relatively\n16\n\fminor for the benchmark based on Sgen, spawner abundances that will result in recovery to SMSY in one generation under equilibrium conditions (green line; i.e., performance of Sgen was relatively insensitive to variability in productivity levels). Those differences were relatively large for benchmarks based on RMSY (black lines) and SMSY (blue line). For the remaining sensitivity analyses, we show results for only a single benchmark, Sgen. The trends in results (direction of change and rank sensitivity of performance to the assumption) were similar among benchmarks.\nS at 50% of RMAX S at 50% of RMAX 40% of SMSY 40% of SMSY Sgen Sgen\n1 1 0 0 % %\n1.0 1.0\n0.8 0.8\n0.6 0.6\n0.4 0.4\n0.2 0.2\n0.0 0.0\nn n o o\ni i t t\na a p p r r i i t t x x e e\nf f\no o y y t t i i l l i i\nb b a a b b o o r r P P\n2 2 0 0 % %\n3 3 0 0 % %\n60% 60%\n70% 70%\n80% 80%\n5 5 0 0 % %\n9 9 0 0 % %\n40% 40%\n0 0\n10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90\nSpawner abundance at equilibruim (1000s of fish) Spawner abundance at equilibruim (1000s of fish)\nFigure 2.

We assumed recruitment followed a Ricker model with autocorrelation and depensation for the base case because of empirical evidence for those phenomena (Chen et al., 2002; Korman et al., 1995; Wood, 1987), and to generate a precautionary evaluation of performance (i.e., an upper estimate of probability of extirpation). When we increased the threshold below which depensation occurred to 7000, the probabilities of extirpation increased to near 100% (Figure 6). Populations were initialized at 1000 spawners in our simulation model and were unable to rebuild from low abundances under that scenario.\n19\n\fn o i t a p r i t x e\nf o y t i l i\nb a b o r\nP\nRicker Ricker w ith AR(1) and dep.

In contrast, when fishing mortality was equal to benchmarks derived from 120-150% of FMSY, FMAX, and FMED, the probabilities of extirpation were moderately low (probabilities 25-50%) or moderately high (probabilities &gt;50%). Performances of benchmarks near FMSY (90%-110% of FMSY) (red line, and black lines directly above and below red line) were least sensitive to variability in productivity; performances of benchmarks derived from FMAX and FMED, (blue and green lines, respectively) were most sensitive (Figure 12). For subsequent sensitivity analyses, we show results for the lower benchmark, FMSY, only. The trends in results (direction of change and rank sensitivity of performance to the assumption) were similar among benchmarks.\n25\n\fFMSY FMSY FMSY FMSY FMAX FMAX FMAX FMAX FMED FMED FMED FMED\n1.0 1.0 1.0\n0.8 0.8 0.8\n0.6 0.6 0.6\n0.4 0.4 0.4\n0.2 0.2 0.2\n0.0 0.0 0.0\nn n o o i i t t a a p p r r i i t t x x e e\nf f o o y y t t i i l l i i\nb b a a b b o o r r P P\n150% 150% 150% 150%\n140% 140% 140% 140%\n130% 130% 130% 130% 120% 120% 120% 120%\n110% 110% 110% 110%\n9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 % % % %\n8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 % % % % 70% 70% 70% 70%\n60% 60% 60% 60% 50% 50% 50% 50%\n0 0 0\n10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90\nSpawner abundance at equilbrium (1000s of fish) Spawner abundance at equilbrium (1000s of fish) Spawner abundance at equilbrium (1000s of fish)\nFigure 11.

Lower benchmarks derived from spawner abundances at various percentages of RMSY (black solid circles) are compared with three other lower benchmarks: spawner abundances at 50% of RMAX (red circle), 40% of SMSY (blue circle), and spawner abundance resulting in recovery to SMSY in one generation without fishing under equilibrium conditions, Sgen (green circle).\nWhen we assumed populations were highly productive (mean Ricker “a” value = 2.0, equivalent to 7.4 recruits/spawner at low spawner abundances), probabilities of recovery within one generation were high (&gt;75% probability) for all benchmarks except for S at 10- 20% of RMSY (Figure 19). In contrast, when we assumed populations were relatively unproductive (mean “a” value = 0.5, equivalent to 1.6 recruits/spawner at low spawner abundances), probabilities of recovery were moderately high (50-75%) for S at 50-90% of RMSY, S at 50% of RMAX and Sgen, and low for the remaining benchmarks. Similar to the results for probability of extirpation over the long term, those differences were relatively minor for the benchmark based on Sgen (green circles; i.e., performance of Sgen was relatively insensitive to variability in productivity levels), and relatively large for benchmarks based on RMSY (black circles) and SMSY (blue circles).\n33\n\fY S M S o t\ny r e v o c e r\nf o y t i l i\nb a b o r P\n1.0\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n% % 0 0 1 1\n% % 0 0 2 2\n% % 0 0 3 3\n% % 0 0 4 4\n% % 0 0 5 5\n% % 0 0 6 6\n% % 0 0 7 7\n% % 0 0 8 8\n% % 0 0 9 9\nSpawner abundance at Spawner abundance at percentage of RMSY percentage of RMSY\nn n e e g g S S\nY Y S S M M S S\nf f\no o % % 0 0 4 4\nX X A A M M R R\nf f\no o % % 0 0 5 5\nt t\na a S S\nFigure 19.

Only lower benchmarks, 40-50% of FMSY had probabilities of recovery to SMSY &gt; 50% within one generation. However, when the time frame of recovery was extended from one to three generations, probabilities of recovery were high (&gt;75% probability) for the benchmarks, 50-100% FMSY, and moderately high (50-75% probability) for benchmarks, 110-140% FMSY\n40\n\fand FMED (Figure 26b). When we assumed that the population was highly productive, (mean Ricker “a” = 2.0), probabilities of recovery within one generation increased to &gt; 50% for benchmarks, 50-90% FMSY, but remained low for the other benchmarks (Figure 27). When we assumed the population was unproductive (mean Ricker “a” = 0.5), the probabilities of recovery within one generation were low for all benchmarks (probabilities &lt;25%) (Figure 27).\nY S M S o t\n1.0\n0.8\ny r e v o c e r\nf\no y t i l i\nb a b o r P\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n\n\n\n% % 0 0 5 5\n% % 0 0 6 6\n% % 0 0 7 7\n% % 0 0 8 8\n% % 0 0 9 9\n% % 0 0 0 0 1 1\n% % 0 0 1 1 1 1\n% % 0 0 2 2 1 1\n% % 0 0 3 3 1 1\n% % 0 0 4 4 1 1\n% % 0 0 5 5 1 1\nFishing mortality at Fishing mortality at percentage of FMSY percentage of FMSY\nY Y S S M M F F\nX X A A M M F F\nD D E E M M F F\n1.0\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n\n\n\n% % 0 0 5 5\n% % 0 0 6 6\n% % 0 0 7 7\n% % 0 0 8 8\n% % 0 0 9 9\n% % 0 0 0 0 1 1\n% % 0 0 1 1 1 1\n% % 0 0 2 2 1 1\n% % 0 0 3 3 1 1\n% % 0 0 4 4 1 1\n% % 0 0 5 5 1 1\nFishing mortality at Fishing mortality at percentage of FMSY percentage of FMSY\nY Y S S M M F F\nX X A A M M F F\nD D E E M M F F\nFigure 26.

In general, increasing uncertainty and harvest resulted in reduced probability of recovery. For one exception, increasing outcome uncertainty resulted in a higher probability of recovery because occasional low harvest rates (below targets) improved performance (increased probability of recovery) more than high harvest rates reduced performance.\n42\n\fY S M S o t\ny r e v o c e r\nf o y t i l i\nb a b o r P\n1.0\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n% % 0 0 5 5\n% % 0 0 6 6\n% % 0 0 7 7\n% % 0 0 8 8\n% % 0 0 9 9\n% % 0 0 0 0 1 1\n% % 0 0 1 1 1 1\n% % 0 0 2 2 1 1\n% % 0 0 3 3 1 1\n% % 0 0 4 4 1 1\n% % 0 0 5 5 1 1\nY Y S S M M F F\nX X A A M M F F\nD D E E M M F F\nFishing mortality at Fishing mortality at percentage of FMSY percentage of FMSY\nFigure 28.

RECOMMENDATIONS\nAlthough results from simulation models such as the one described here are typically highly sensitive to assumptions about model structure and parameterization (Dulvy et al., 2004), the relative performance of candidate management decisions (or lower benchmarks for status assessment) and their sensitivities to alternative model assumptions can provide useful information when evaluating management options (Mace et al., 2008). For metrics of spawner abundances, we suggest deriving a lower benchmark from Sgen, the abundance of spawner that will result in rebuilding to SMSY under equilibrium conditions in the absence of fishing, because in our simulation model, the performance of Sgen (i.e., the probabilities of extirpation and recovery to a target) was more robust to variability in stock productivity than benchmarks calculated from proportions of SMSY, SMAX, or S at proportions of RMSY. Sgen was also associated with a relatively low probability of extirpation over 100 years (probability &lt;25%) for populations with equilibrium spawner abundances &gt;15 000 fish, and high probability of recovery within three generations (probability &gt;75%). Sgen was chosen by the BC Ministry of the Environment as a limit reference point (a level of abundance “that defines a highly undesired state” (Johnston et al., 2002, p.4)) for steelhead, Oncorhynchus mykiss, based on the results of a similar simulation modelling exercise. They further suggested that in the absence of data on stock productivity to calculate Sgen, 15% of carrying capacity (or between 10% and 20%) be used as a proxy lower reference point.\nFor metrics of fishing mortality, we suggest deriving a lower benchmark from FMSY (fishing mortality at maximum sustained yield) because the probability of recovery for that benchmark was more robust to variability in stock productivity than benchmarks calculated from proportions of FMSY, FMAX, or FMED. In addition, FMSY was associated with a relatively low probability of extirpation over 100 years (probability &lt;25%) when equilibrium abundances were &gt; 30,000 fish, and high probability of recovery within three generations (probability &gt;75%). Furthermore, that choice is consistent with the recommendation of FMSY as a “limit reference point” by the UN Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks Agreement (1995).\n48\n\f5.

Broad declines in Canadian Pacific salmon abundances have been linked to global climate change and other factors such as deteriorating habitats, increased fish disease, and invasive species (Grant et al. 2019). To track salmon biodiversity change, we present a Wild Salmon Policy (WSP) rapid status assessment approach for Pacific salmon. This approach can assign a Red, Amber, or Green status, with High, Medium or Low confidence to salmon conservation units (CUs) with applicable data.\nPacific salmon adaptive diversity occurs at a range of scales that include the species, CU, population and deme. The WSP identifies diversity at the scale of CUs, which are fundamental units that cannot be recolonized if lost (DFO 2005; Holtby and Ciruna 2007; Wade et al. 2019). Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO)’s WSP covers five species of Pacific salmon: Sockeye (Oncorhynchus nerka), Chinook (O. tshawytscha), Coho (O. kisutch), Pink (O. gorbuscha) and Chum Salmon (O. keta). DFO has the authority to manage these salmon under the Fisheries Act (2019). Steelhead (O. mykiss) are managed provincially, and therefore are not included in WSP rapid status assessments.\nThis Canadian Science Advisory Secretariate (CSAS) review of the WSP rapid status assessment approach was requested by DFO Science Branch to support the evaluation of Pacific salmon Stock Management Unit (SMU) statuses relative to their Limit Reference Points (LRPs). An SMU defines a group of one or more Pacific salmon CUs that are managed together with the objective of achieving a joint status. The LRP represents the status below which serious harm is occurring to the stock, based on biological criteria established by DFO Science through peer review. An SMU below its LRP triggers a rebuilding plan. A recent CSAS process recommended that LRPs for SMUs be defined as a percentage, with the objective being that 100% of all CUs in the SMU are above the WSP Red status zone (DFO 2023; Holt et al. 2023a, 2023b). An SMU falls below the LRP if one or more CUs in an SMU are in the WSP Red status zone. The WSP rapid status approach was recommended for assessing LRP status (DFO 2023; Holt et al. 2023a). Subsequently through the current report’s CSAS process, a recommended next step is the vetting of the individual CU WSP rapid status results, and LRP status determination, by experts in a structured process.\nExisting WSP integrated status assessments provide a foundational approach to tracking annual salmon CU status. This approach uses an expert decision-making process to combine statuses across individual WSP metrics, and additional related information, into a single integrated status. However, the WSP integrated status assessment approach only gets us part- way to tracking annual CU status, since it is time- and labor-intensive, and as a result, has only been completed for 11% of the current 377 CUs, and is 5–10 years out of date. To expand the number of CUs assessed, and provide annual CU status updates, this paper presents a new\nJanuary 2024\n\fPacific Region\nScience Response: Rapid Status Assessments for Pacific Salmon\nWSP rapid status approach that approximates the expert decision-making process used in the integrated status assessments. Annual WSP rapid statuses are estimated using an algorithm implemented with computer code for British Columbia (BC) and Yukon CUs with applicable data.\nThe WSP rapid status approach provides more complete coverage of WSP statuses across CUs. Expanding the number of assessed CUs will require input from stock assessment experts to select appropriate escapement enumeration sites and years, and to perform data treatments such as gap filling as applicable. Experts would work iteratively to explore specifications for use with the WSP rapid status algorithm, such as identifying applicable WSP rapid status metrics for these data, and reviewing the WSP rapid statuses generated by the algorithm to finalize the approach for their CUs. The establishment of a governance strategy for this work is recommended, including the identification of roles and responsibilities, to ensure the inclusion of new CUs, and annual updates across CUs.\nThe WSP rapid status approach is integrated into DFO’s Pacific Salmon Status Scanner. DFO’s Salmon Scanner is an interactive data visualization tool specifically designed for experts to support scientific exploration and help them incorporate science into decision-making processes. Experts are those with expertise on Pacific salmon including stock assessment biologists, Indigenous technical experts, research scientists, habitat, harvest, and hatchery management biologists, etc.\nThe objectives of this Science Response are to:\n\nSummarize the methods, results, and conclusions of the WSP rapid status approach. The\n\ndevelopment of this approach included three key components:\n\na performance evaluation of candidate WSP rapid status algorithms against existing\n\nCSAS reviewed WSP integrated statuses;\n\nan evaluation of the application of the rapid status algorithm to years and CUs that\n\ncurrently do not have WSP integrated statuses completed;\n\na measure of confidence in WSP rapid status results.\n\n\nDocument the review processes that have occurred to develop the rapid status algorithm.\nProvide advice on next steps and future work.\n\nThis Science Response Report results from the regional peer review of November 18, 2022 on the Rapid status approximations for Pacific salmon derived from integrated expert assessments under Fisheries and Oceans Canada Wild Salmon Policy.\nBackground\nCore Principles\nThere are three core principles of the WSP rapid status assessment approach:\n\nThe first core principle is that WSP CUs were identified and rapid statuses were developed based on conservation biology principles (Mace and Lande 1991; Mace et al. 1992, 2008; Caughley 1994; National Research Council (US) Committee on Scientific Issues in the Endangered Species Act 1998; McElhany et al. 2000; Rodrigues et al. 2006), and are aligned with scientific peer reviewed publications (Holtby and Ciruna 2007; Holt 2009, 2010; Holt et al. 2009; Grant et al. 2011, 2020; Grant and Pestal 2013; DFO 2015, 2016; Brown et al. 2019). This ensures that Pacific salmon statuses are scientifically objective, consistent,\n\n2\n\fPacific Region\nScience Response: Rapid Status Assessments for Pacific Salmon\nand comparable across BC/Yukon CUs. Standardized metrics also need to be widely applicable and relatively easy to use and update regularly. Specifically:\n\nThe WSP identifies diversity at the scale of CUs, as fundamental units that cannot be recolonized if lost (DFO 2005). Methods to identify CUs (Holtby and Ciruna 2007), revisions to the original CU list (Grant et al. 2011; Brown et al. 2019), and development of a process for revising CUs (Wade et al. 2019) have been peer reviewed through DFO CSAS processes.\nWSP integrated statuses fall into one of three key status zones: Red (poor), Amber (intermediate) or Green (good), with two intermediate zones (Red/Amber and Amber/Green) (Table 1). The CU WSP integrated status assessments that have been completed were based on ~15 years of methods development and preparation, and occurred through CSAS meetings that took up to three days and 40 experts to complete (Holt 2009; Holt et al. 2009; Grant et al. 2011, 2020; Grant and Pestal 2013; DFO 2015, 2016). These WSP integrated status assessment processes involved broad collaboration across salmon stock assessment experts both within DFO and across Indigenous groups, consultants, NGOs, etc.\nThe WSP status assessment approach builds on the status assessment approach used by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) for global species (Rodrigues et al. 2006; Mace et al. 2008; IUCN 2022), which has been adopted by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) for Canadian species (COSEWIC 2021). A COSEWIC species is roughly equivalent to a WSP CU. The WSP Red status zone largely aligns with COSEWIC’s Endangered status; Amber aligns with Threatened and Special Concern status; and Green aligns with Not at Risk status (See Appendix A.5 in Pestal et al. 2023).\n\n\nThe second core principle is the vetting of data and evaluation of WSP rapid statuses by CU\n\nexperts. DFO stock assessment leads work in collaboration with Indigenous groups, consultants, and others that support or lead salmon stock assessment programs. These CU experts work iteratively to fine tune the CU data used (determining appropriate spawner escapement enumeration sites, years, data treatment, etc.), and select applicable WSP status metrics and metric calculation details, given their knowledge of the data. WSP rapid statuses generated by the algorithm are used to evaluate these settings.\n\nThe third core principle is continual learning and refinement. This means that data sets and status metrics for each CU will be regularly reviewed and updated, and that the rapid status algorithm will be reviewed through ongoing iterative work with CU experts (described in the second core principle). By evaluating WSP rapid status algorithm outputs for the CUs for which they have expertise, CU experts can identify where decision-rules may be revised or added to the WSP rapid status algorithm. As new CU cases are added, where common new and/or revised decision-rules are proposed, the revised WSP rapid status algorithm performance can be tested for overall improvements.\n\nAnalysis and Response\nAlgorithm Development Background\n• A set of candidate WSP rapid status algorithms were developed as decision trees. A CU’s WSP rapid status is assigned depending on answers to a sequence of dichotomous Yes/No questions using status metrics (see Figure 1 for the Learning Tree 3 algorithm). The combination of metrics applied, and their individual values or statuses, leads to a final WSP\n3\n\fPacific Region\nScience Response: Rapid Status Assessments for Pacific Salmon\nrapid status determination. The WSP rapid status decision trees approximate the decision- making process that experts used in WSP integrated status assessment processes to determine final CU statuses. Decision-making in WSP integrated status assessments was conducted by experts using standard data summary packages and their own expert input on CU data, within a structured process.\n• Seven candidate algorithms were developed and evaluated (Table 2).\no Three fitted algorithms: developed using Classification and Regression Tree (CART)\nanalyses (more details provided in subsequent sections) (Table 2; Section 2.4.2 in Pestal et al. 2023);\no Four constructed algorithms: developed with a combination of CART decision tree\nelements and common rationale from the WSP integrated status assessment processes (Table 2; Section 2.4.3 in Pestal et al. 2023). Common rationale are extracted from the narratives that experts developed in each WSP integrated status assessment process; narratives describe the metrics, statuses, and additional related information that experts used to determine the final integrated WSP status for each CU (see Appendix B in Pestal et al. 2023).\n• Depending on the candidate WSP rapid status algorithm, the status for a CU can be assigned as: one of the five status zones described for WSP integrated statuses (above); one of the three key status zones (Red, Amber or Green); or one of two zones (Red or Not Red) (Tables 1 and 2).\n• A performance evaluation was conducted across the seven candidates to select the\nalgorithm for WSP rapid status evaluations (see next section: Analysis Outline). A set of six criteria were established to evaluate the performance of each candidate algorithm. These were evaluated with quantitative performance measures and qualitative considerations. Quantitative performance evaluations compared past WSP integrated statuses (considered ‘true statuses’) to WSP rapid statuses generated by each algorithm, using identical data across CUs.\n• Algorithms were developed using a standard suite of metrics that align with those\napplied in the WSP integrated status processes. A standard suite of metrics is foundational to assessing wildlife species’ status. Such a suite has been established globally through the IUCN (Rodrigues et al. 2006; Mace et al. 2008; IUCN 2022) and adopted in Canada by COSEWIC (COSEWIC 2021). The WSP emphasizes ‘standardized monitoring of wild salmon status’ (DFO 2005; Holt et al. 2009).\n• Standardized metrics enable objective and transparent assessments of status, and the production of consistent status results. This is key in order to compare statuses across assessed species, or CUs in the case of the WSP. Standardized metrics also need to be widely applicable and relatively easy to use and update regularly (Mace and Lande 1991).\n• The standard metrics used in WSP rapid status algorithms were generally the same metrics used in the WSP integrated status assessments. These metrics assess abundances and trends in Pacific salmon CUs.\n• The WSP rapid status algorithm provides a method to readily compare statuses\nacross CUs and years. The rapid statuses are designed to approximate expert-driven WSP integrated status assessment processes, and similar to IUCN and COSEWIC, be broadly applicable to the assessed group, in this case Pacific salmon CUs. Expert opinion is critical in the selection of appropriate data and metrics to use in the algorithm, and to propose new and revised decision-rules that may improve overall algorithm performance. Expert input is\n4\n\fPacific Region\nScience Response: Rapid Status Assessments for Pacific Salmon\nalso critical when the WSP rapid statuses are used in more formal processes like LRP status assessments, prioritization activities, state of salmon reporting, climate change vulnerability assessments, etc. The WSP rapid statuses can form the foundation of status assessments required for these more formal processes. Similar to past WSP integrated status assessment processes, expert input can be provided in a structured way in these processes, to fine tune WSP rapid statuses while ensuring that they remain consistent and comparable.\nAnalysis Outline\nThe WSP rapid status approach has evolved from previously developed peer-reviewed methods (Holt 2009; Holt et al. 2009; Grant et al. 2011, 2020; Grant and Pestal 2013; DFO 2015, 2016). Analyses details are provided in two accompanying technical reports (Pestal et al. 2023; Pestal et al. In prep1). To develop the WSP rapid status algorithm that approximates the detailed WSP integrated status assessment approach, we worked through the following 11 steps (details provided in Pestal et al. 2023).\n\nCompiled the learning data set. This includes key metric values, corresponding metric\n\nstatuses, and WSP integrated statuses (considered ‘true’ statuses) for CUs from the four past WSP integrated status assessments (Grant and Pestal 2013; DFO 2015, 2016; Grant et al. 2020).\n\nIdentified six performance criteria to guide the construction, evaluation, and selection of candidate algorithms. Performance evaluation of algorithms included quantitative error evaluation, and qualitative considerations relative to these criteria.\nFit Classification and Regression Tree (CART) models to the learning data set: this includes metric values or statuses and corresponding WSP integrated statuses (‘true’ statuses) derived from existing WSP integrated status assessments. Trees were fit using various combinations of predictor (metric values and statuses on those metrics) and response variable (CU status) formats, data subsets, and model fit settings (e.g., complexity penalty, error weighting).\nSelected candidate CART algorithms (‘fitted algorithms’) to span the range of trees possible\n\nfrom the available data and settings, from very simple to very complex.\n\nReviewed narratives provided by experts for their CU WSP integrated status designations, in order to extract common rationale for these designations across CUs. These narratives are reprinted in Appendix B in Pestal et al. 2023 from published reports for Fraser Sockeye (Grant and Pestal 2013; Grant et al. 2020), and unpublished reports for Interior Fraser Coho2 and Southern BC Chinook3.\n\n1 Pestal, G., MacDonald, B.L., Grant, S.C.H., and Carr-Harris, C.

Integrated Biological Status Assessments under the Wild Salmon Policy Using Standardized Metrics and Expert Judgement: Southern British Columbia.\n5\n\fPacific Region\nScience Response: Rapid Status Assessments for Pacific Salmon\n\nDeveloped custom algorithms (‘constructed algorithms’) by combining CART-derived\n\nalgorithm branches from step 4, with common rationale from WSP integrated status assessment processes in step 5.\n\nImplemented candidate algorithms as an R function to estimate WSP rapid statuses using\n\nexisting WSP status assessment metrics (learning data set).\n\nEvaluated algorithm performance according to the criteria identified in Step 2.\nComplied out-of-sample data sets for years and CUs that do not have WSP integrated\n\nstatus assessments completed (see next Data Section for adding new data for out-of- sample testing). Conducted out-of-sample testing.\n\nReviewed results with salmon stock assessment experts.\nPerformed sensitivity tests (with and without using relative abundance metrics).\n\nSteps 3 and 4 above were repeated through an iterative, collaborative process as authors of Pestal et al. 2023 explored the effect of alternative CART settings and identified a shortlist of candidate CART algorithms.\nSteps 5–10 above were also repeated through an iterative process. Constructed algorithms were developed and refined through evaluating performance and reviewing documentation from the status workshops to identify missing components and uncover special considerations.\nData\nLearning Data Set\nThe first phase of algorithm development was to build a learning data set. The purpose of the learning data set was to support the development and evaluation of the candidate algorithms.\nThe learning data set for this analysis consists of the exact WSP metric values, metric statuses, and corresponding WSP integrated statuses from the four completed WSP integrated status assessments. This included two assessments for Fraser Sockeye (Grant and Pestal 2013; Grant et al. 2020), one for Interior Fraser Coho2 (DFO 2015) and Southern BC Chinook3 (DFO 2016; Brown et al. 2019). These assessments covered 47 CUs, or 65 cases, from these three species groups (see Section 2.2.1.1 in Pestal et al. 2023 for details). WSP integrated status assessment processes relied on years of work selecting and treating the data, and identifying relevant metrics, benchmarks, and specifications (such as average generation length) required to assess WSP status. Processes also relied on workshops and CSAS peer review to finalize data, metrics, metric interpretation, and status assignments.\nMetric values used in the completed WSP integrated status assessments had to be transformed for the algorithm inputs, because algorithm fitting requires that a single value and status be identified for each of the four metrics used to assess rapid status (see Section 2.2.4.1 in Pestal et al. 2023 for details).\nOut-of-Sample Data Set\nAn out-of-sample data set was also built to support the evaluation of candidate algorithms for years with no existing WSP integrated status assessments. This data set was also used for the selected algorithm on CUs with no existing WSP integrated status assessments.\nFor each group of new CUs, such as those used in the out-of-samples test, and when adding new annual data for previously assessed CUs, we worked with the CU stock assessment experts to assign and evaluate statuses. Vetting data in collaboration with CU experts is the second core principle of WSP rapid status assessments. For each CU, initial development of a\n6\n\fPacific Region\nScience Response: Rapid Status Assessments for Pacific Salmon\nWSP rapid status data set requires that DFO CU stock assessment experts work in collaboration with their DFO teams, Indigenous groups, consultants, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and others that support, lead or collaborate on salmon stock assessment programs. Through the vetting process, we eliminate any data sets or metrics that would not produce reliable status results. This also ensures that data selection and treatment are standardized.\nWe moved through the following steps to develop data sets for new years and CUs with no previous WSP integrated status assessments (as described in Pestal et al. In prep1):\n\nReview the CU list to identify and document any changes from the last published version.\nReview CU-level data, document any major changes from the last published version, and\n\ncalculate status metrics.\n\nReview a range of input specifications that identify applicable data, data treatment and\n\nappropriate WSP status metrics for the CU. This includes selecting spawner escapement enumeration sites that are appropriate for status assessments, start years for data that will ensure consistent escapement time series, appropriate gap-filling and data smoothing treatments if required, appropriate relative-abundance benchmarks if available and applicable, etc.\n\nApply the WSP rapid status algorithm with a range of input specifications, as recommended\n\nby CU experts, and review preliminary rapid statuses.\n\nRepeat steps 3-4 until there is consensus among the stock assessment experts that the\n\nWSP rapid statuses generated by the algorithms are reasonable.\nPestal et al. (In prep)1 documents the data and specification details for each group of CUs included in the case studies. Here we briefly list any major changes made to the CU list or data treatment steps that would cause the data used for this assessment to deviate from previously published versions:\n• Fraser Sockeye: No changes in the CU list. No changes in the data treatment for 23 of the 24 CUs since the last integrated status assessment. Data for 2016–2019 were added using consistent data treatment methods (Grant et al. 2020). The only exception is Cultus-L, which was changed from a previous Red status to data deficient. This change was due to unresolved questions regarding how to interpret the data for recent years affected by the captive brood (hatchery enhancement) program.\n•\nInterior Fraser Coho: no changes in the CU list and the data treatment since the last integrated status assessment2 (DFO 2015), just additional years of data.\n• Southern BC (SBC) Chinook: No changes in the CU list. For most CUs, the data treatment was as per the last published (Brown et al. 2019), using foundations from an unpublished data report3. Changes were implemented for several CUs:\no Data treatment for the three west coast Vancouver Island (WCVI) CUs was revised for consistency with a recent case study reviewed by CSAS (Holt et al. 2023b) and further revised based on guidance from CU experts. Specifically, the set of indicator sites used to build the CU-level time series was revised based on new information (Proportionate Natural Influence (PNI), Withler et al. 2018) on hatchery contribution. This PNI-based revision to CU-level time series is potentially applicable to many other SBC Chinook CUs that are currently data deficient due to the enhancement rating for indicator sites, and could greatly expand coverage of the rapid status scan (e.g., Inner South Coast).\n7\n\fPacific Region\nScience Response: Rapid Status Assessments for Pacific Salmon\no New data were provided by BC Interior staff for Okanagan Chinook, using estimates of\nnatural-origin spawners developed by the Okanagan Nation Alliance.\n• Fraser Pink: No changes in CU list. Data provided by DFO (M. Townsend and J.A. Tadey,\nDFO).\n• Fraser Chum: No changes in CU list. Data provided by DFO (M. Townsend and J.A. Tadey,\nDFO).\n• Skeena and Nass Sockeye: Stock-level data were recently peer reviewed (Pestal et al. In prep4). Stocks mostly match up with WSP CUs. For cases where stock-level data combine multiple CUs, mostly groups of 2–3 small lakes, CU-level data were developed by assigning the available time series to the largest CU and assessing the smaller CUs as data deficient. This is consistent with how the same data issue was handled for the Chilko-S/Chilko-ES combined time series in the Fraser Sockeye status assessments. For Babine Lake, the three CUs identified by Holtby and Ciruna (2007) were revised to timing-based CUs (Early, Mid, Late). Pinkut and Fulton were excluded from the WSP rapid status assessment data sets because the majority of Sockeye production comes from large-scale actively-managed spawning channels.\nWSP Metrics\nThe WSP rapid status approach uses two abundance metrics (relative abundance and absolute abundance) and two trend in abundance metrics (long term trend and percent change). Benchmarks unique to each metric were used in past WSP integrated status assessments to delineate the metric’s Red, Amber, and Green status zones.\nAll four metrics (relative abundance, absolute abundance, long-term trend, and percent change) incorporate an estimate of the generational average of spawner abundance in their calculation. However, this was calculated differently for different groups of CUs. The generational average is calculated as the geometric mean across the number of years corresponding to the most common age class (e.g., four years for most Fraser Sockeye). For Fraser Sockeye CUs, spawner time series were smoothed prior to calculating generational averages, whereas for Interior Fraser Coho and Southern BC Chinook, generational averages were calculated using unsmoothed time series, in part because of high proportions of missing data that made generational smoothing unreliable.\nMore details on the metrics are as follows:\n• Relative abundance: This metric compares a CU’s current generational average of\nspawner abundance (geometric mean) to upper and lower benchmarks. For the purpose of the WSP rapid status algorithm process, relative abundance metric values are calculated as two proportions (current generational average abundance / lower benchmark; current generational average abundance / upper benchmark). Benchmarks are estimated with a) stock-recruitment models (Holt et al. 2009; Grant et al. 2011; Grant and Pestal 2013), b) freshwater habitat capacity models (Parken et al. 2006; Grant et al. 2011, 2020; Grant and Pestal 2013; DFO 2015, 2016), or c) percentiles of the spawner abundance time series (Holt et al. 2018). These benchmarks are unique to each CU. Across all approaches, the relative\n4 Pestal, G.P., Carr-Harris, C., Cox-Rogers, S., English, K., Alexander, R., and the Skeena Nass Sockeye Technical Working Group. 2023.

In preparation.\n8\n\fPacific Region\nScience Response: Rapid Status Assessments for Pacific Salmon\nabundance metric is applied only when CU experts both confirm its applicability to the existing CU data, and provide benchmarks they consider appropriate.\n• Stock-recruitment-based benchmarks are recommended for CUs with applicable stock- recruitment data. Using this method, the lower benchmark is Sgen, the escapement that would result in recovery to SMSY in one generation, and the upper benchmark is 80% SMSY. SMSY is the spawner abundance at maximum sustainable yield (Holt 2009, 2010; Holt et al. 2009). Where these were used for Southern BC Chinook CUs, the upper benchmark was 85% SMSY to align with the Pacific Salmon Treaty (PST) process.\n• Where stock-recruitment data are not available, benchmarks derived from a CU’s freshwater habitat capacity have been used for the relative abundance metric. Benchmarks for one Fraser Sockeye CU (Chilliwack-ES) were based on the capacity of the rearing lake used during the freshwater juvenile stage (Holt et al. 2009; Grant et al. 2011). For Southern BC Chinook CUs, habitat-capacity benchmarks were based on the CU’s watershed area (Parken et al. 2006) using Sgen (lower benchmark) and 85% SMSY (upper benchmark), to align with PST benchmarks. However, expert consensus in the WSP integrated status workshop was to not use these benchmarks for CUs where only relative indices of abundance were available, which includes most of the Southern BC Chinook CUs (DFO 2015). Recent work has identified habitat-based biological benchmarks for WCVI Chinook CUs based on habitat capacity for sites included in the index of abundance (Holt et al. 2023b), and these have been incorporated into the out-of-sample data sets: the retrospective for CUs with previous WSP integrated status assessments completed (Pestal et al. 2023), and for CUs with no previous assessments (Pestal et al. In prep1).\n• Percentile benchmarks were not used in past WSP integrated status assessment processes (learning data set), and were not provided by experts for new CUs in the out-of-sample data set.\n• Absolute abundance: This metric compares the average escapement of the most recent generation (geometric mean) to COSEWIC criterion D1 and part of criterion C, which are used to define ‘Threatened Species’ (COSEWIC 2021). The lower benchmark is set at 1,000 to align with criterion D1, and the upper benchmark is set at 10,000, which is used in combination with other abundance metrics under criterion C (COSEWIC 2021). Similar to the relative abundance metric, metric values are calculated as two proportions (current generational average abundance / lower benchmark; current generational average abundance / upper benchmark).\n• The absolute abundance benchmarks are grounded in fundamental principles of population and conservation ecology. The value 1,000 is a critical threshold from conservation biology (National Research Council (US) Committee on Scientific Issues in the Endangered Species Act 1998; McElhany et al. 2000). Below 1,000 a population is more at risk from demographic stochasticity, such as randomly in a given year producing mostly males or females. They also are at greater risk from environmental change and catastrophic events, have greater risk of accumulating deleterious genetic mutations, and have a low evolutionary potential to adapt to environmental change.\n• The value 10,000 is an upper limit on population size particularly at risk from environmental variation and catastrophes. Population sizes above 10,000 are protected from moderate to high environmental variation, as one example (National Research Council (US) Committee on Scientific Issues in the Endangered Species Act 1998; McElhany et al. 2000). Currently, deteriorating environmental conditions are increasingly occurring in salmon habitats due to climate change, with more extreme events like flooding, drought, fires, and heatwaves (Bush\n9\n\fPacific Region\nScience Response: Rapid Status Assessments for Pacific Salmon\nand Lemmen 2019; Cheung et al. 2021; IPCC 2022; Cheng et al. 2023). These events can also occur concurrently, compounding their impacts on wildlife species.\n• For these reasons, the IUCN and COSEWIC include small population size criteria to account for increased extinction risk within their status assessment process (COSEWIC 2021; IUCN 2022). Wildlife species assessed by these organizations may be perpetually classified in Threatened or Endangered at risk categories if populations are small. Conservation science shows that higher extinction risk exists for such small populations regardless of whether they have remained stable at low abundances for several generations.\n• The 1,000 benchmark was used by experts in the past WSP integrated status assessments, in combination with other metrics and additional information, to determine CU status, as documented in the narratives for Fraser Sockeye, Southern BC Chinook and Interior Fraser Coho (see Appendix B in Pestal et al. 2023 for narratives reprinted from CSAS publications).\n• Long-term trend in abundance: This metric compares the ratio of the current generational average (geometric mean) spawner abundance to the long-term average (geometric mean). Lower and upper benchmarks for this metric are 50% and 75%, respectively.\n• Percent change (short-term trend in abundance): This metric quantifies the linear change in total spawner abundance (or effective female spawners for Fraser Sockeye CUs) over the most recent three generations. Lower and upper benchmarks for this metric are -25% and -15%, respectively.\n• To calculate the percent change metric, all CU spawner abundance time series were log-\ntransformed. For most CUs, the time series was also smoothed using a running generational average (Fraser Sockeye, Fraser Chum, Fraser Pink, Interior Fraser Coho, and Skeena- Nass Sockeye). However, for Interior Fraser Coho and Southern BC Chinook, no smoothing was done, in part because of high proportions of missing data that made generational smoothing unreliable.\nFitted Algorithms using CART Analyses\nCART analyses were a useful starting point for algorithm construction (Section 2.4.2 in Pestal et al. 2023). Three algorithms were developed using CART analyses: Minimalist (Table 2; Appendix D.1 in Pestal et al. 2023), Fancy Pants (Table 2; Appendix D.2 in Pestal et al. 2023), and Categorical Realist (Table 2; Appendix D.3 in Pestal et al. 2023).\nBriefly, CART searches for a binary split in available data or cases, which uses a criterion to divide the original group of cases into two smaller groups of cases. Tree branches are added as these new groups are further split into even smaller groups.\nWhat determines the ‘best’ grouping of cases depends on error rates (i.e., number of incorrect classifications), error type (e.g., false positives vs. false negatives in a classification tree that screens for a medical condition), and tree complexity (i.e., the number of branches on the tree). In CART, the fitting step balances the number of branches (complexity) against the magnitude and type of misclassifications.\nWe used the R package Rpart (Therneau and Atkinson 2023) to fit classification trees to our learning data set of 65 completed WSP status assessments, using the metrics as predictor variables and WSP integrated statuses as the response variables. Rpart uses cross-validation to estimate error between predictor and response variables. We explored alternative fitted trees working through variations of response variables, predictor variables, model fits, and data sub- setting (Section 2.4.2 in Pestal et al. 2023). When using metric values as the predictor variable,\n10\n\fPacific Region\nScience Response: Rapid Status Assessments for Pacific Salmon\nthe CART analysis finds threshold metric values to create binary splits in the data. These thresholds do not align with the WSP metric benchmarks in all cases (see below).\nConstructed Algorithms\nUsing the CART-fitted algorithms as a baseline, we built constructed algorithms (Section 2.4.3 in Pestal et al. 2023) to more closely align with the six performance criteria (next section). We started with the construction of two candidate algorithms for a detailed performance evaluation, one very simple: Simply Red (Table 2; Appendix D.4 in Pestal et al. 2023), and the other more complex: Learning Tree 1 (Table 2; Appendix D.5 in Pestal et al. 2023). Subsequently, the complex algorithm went through two further steps of evolution, producing the Learning Tree 2 (Table 2; Appendix D.6 in Pestal et al. 2023) and Learning Tree 3 (Table 2; Appendix D.7 in Pestal et al. 2023).\nThe Learning Tree evolution from version one to three illustrates the adaptive approach we are proposing for future implementation of this algorithm. We constructed the Learning Tree family of algorithms using decision nodes found in the CART-fitted trees, and integrated these with the common rationale extracted from existing WSP integrated status assessments (Appendix B in Pestal et al. 2023). Development of the Learning Tree algorithms was highly iterative. As each branch evolved, this algorithm was evaluated for biological rationale and consistency with the WSP integrated status assessment processes, and error rates were investigated.\nMetric thresholds in the Learning Tree algorithm were based on those determined through CART analyses, though some were minorly adjusted to better align with the data and common rationale from WSP integrated status assessments. These thresholds differ from WSP metric benchmarks in some cases, particularly where they are being applied in sequence with multiple other metrics:\n• Absolute abundance: the lower threshold equals the WSP lower benchmark plus 50%;\nspecifically, this is a buffer of 500 on the COSEWIC metric benchmark of 1,000, increasing the threshold to 1,500. This aligns with how experts in past WSP integrated status assessment processes considered uncertainty in the data, and how experts compared each of the past four to twelve years to the COSEWIC criterion D1 (small population size) threshold of 1,000. Since the algorithm compares a CU’s current generational average of spawner abundances, not individual years, to the COSEWIC threshold, applying a buffer to the benchmark for this metric is consistent with the precautionary approach taken by experts when considering this metric.\n• Relative abundance: the upper threshold equals the WSP upper benchmark plus 10%; this buffer was included to account for how this metric was treated in the WSP integrated status processes. In the Learning Tree 3 algorithm, the relative abundance lower threshold is equal to the WSP lower benchmark.\n• Long term trend: the lower threshold is 79%, while the WSP lower benchmark is 50%; the upper threshold is 233%, while the WSP upper benchmark is 75%. Long term trend thresholds applied in the Learning Tree 3 algorithm emerged from the CART analyses. These thresholds are applied by the algorithm in combination with additional information, namely, the absolute abundance metric, if available. The upper threshold (233%) is only applied in concert with the percent change metric, and is conditional on that value.\n• Percent change: the lower threshold is -70%, while the lower benchmark is -25%. The\nLearning Tree 3 algorithm only applies one threshold to the percent change metric, -70%. This threshold emerged from the CART analyses, with minor adjustments to better align with the data and common rationale used in the WSP integrated status assessment processes\n11\n\fPacific Region\nScience Response: Rapid Status Assessments for Pacific Salmon\n(see subsequent sections). The percent change metric is conditionally applied by the Learning Tree 3 algorithm. That is, it is applied if the long term trend metric has a value greater than 79%, and if an absolute abundance metric is available, the value of this metric falls above it’s upper benchmark (equivalent to a generational average of 10,000 spawners).\nPerformance Criteria\nWe iteratively evaluated and altered candidate algorithms based on their performance against a set of predetermined criteria. For some algorithms, this was done by adjusting the CART tree fit settings. For other algorithms we actively revised or reorganized the decision nodes (Section 2.4 in Pestal et al. 2023). The criteria used to guide the construction and evaluation of candidate algorithms were as follows:\n\nAlgorithms should have relatively low error rates when comparing WSP rapid statuses to\n\nintegrated statuses, the latter which are assumed to be ‘true’ statuses.\n\nAlgorithm errors should be precautionary, meaning that estimated WSP rapid statuses\n\nshould err on the side of being poorer, indicating a higher risk of extirpation, when compared to ‘true’ WSP integrated statuses. For example, if a ‘true’ integrated WSP status is Amber, a status error should be more likely to be Red over Green.\n\nAlgorithms must be broadly applicable across CUs with different data types and metric\n\navailability.\n\nAlgorithms that estimate WSP rapid status for three main status zones, Red, Amber, and\n\nGreen are preferred.\n\nAlgorithms should reflect thresholds that emerged as those distinguishing statuses in WSP integrated status assessment. These tend to be equal to or more biologically conservative than WSP benchmarks from Holt et al. (2009).\nAlgorithm decisions should adhere to the logic applied in the WSP integrated status\n\nassessments. This includes the following common rationale applied in the detailed WSP integrated status assessment processes. Narratives from past processes are reprinted in Appendix B in Pestal et al. (2023). The original publications are published through CSAS for Fraser Sockeye (Grant and Pestal 2013; Grant et al. 2020) and unpublished for Interior Fraser Coho2 and Southern BC Chinook3.\nPerformance of the algorithms on criteria 1, 2, and 3 can be quantified using error rates, measures of bias (specifically over-prediction), and completion rates, respectively. Completion rate is the proportion of the 65 cases in the learning data set for which rapid status could be assigned. These quantitative performance measures were calculated across all CUs and by species.\nPerformance on criterion 4 can be easily evaluated by checking that all three simple WSP integrated status zones (Red, Amber, and Green) are included as branches of the algorithm trees.\nPerformance on the remaining criteria, 5 and 6, is subjective and was evaluated by experts.\nQuantitative Performance Measures\nFor the 65 cases in the learning data set, we compared WSP rapid statuses generated by each of the candidate algorithms to existing WSP integrated statuses (considered ‘true’ statuses).\n12\n\fPacific Region\nScience Response: Rapid Status Assessments for Pacific Salmon\nWe used the entire learning data set to evaluate performance using the six criteria above. Due to the small sample size, we did not use cross-validation approaches that split data into learning and testing data sets, as is commonly done for forecasting models (see review in MacDonald and Grant 2012). Cross-validation is generally recommended to minimize the risk of over-tuning models to the idiosyncrasies of the data being used; this is intended to minimize overly optimistic expectations for how models will perform with new data sets (Picard and Cook 1984). However, the learning data set had a relatively small sample, making cross-validation inappropriate (Picard and Cook 1984).\nInstead, to prevent overfitting the candidate algorithms to CUs and years in the learning data set, and to ensure that the algorithms were broadly applicable to all BC and Yukon CUs, we applied the following methods:\n• We developed performance criteria to guide the construction, evaluation and selection of\ncandidate algorithms (see previous section). If we had relied exclusively on model performance determined through cross-validation, this would have increased the risk of selecting an algorithm that is ‘overfitted’ to the learning data set.\n• Algorithm development included both fitted and constructed algorithms:\no Three fitted algorithms were developed using CART analyses (Section 2.4.2 in Pestal et al. 2023), which uses cross-validation to determine error rates and types. Using CART analyses, algorithm fit is determined by balancing error rates and types, and tree complexity. Different fitted algorithms were developed by altering both the complexity setting from low to high, and altering the use of metric values or statuses. CART analysis was conducted using the R package rpart (Therneau and Atkinson 2023).\no Four constructed algorithms (Section 2.4.3 in Pestal et al. 2023) were developed using the CART algorithms as a baseline. These algorithms were built to more closely align with the performance criteria, and incorporate common rationale extracted from existing WSP integrated status assessments. Considering common rationale that would be applicable to a broad range of CU data types reduced the risk of overfitting algorithms to the learning data set.\n• We conducted an out-of-sample test with the seven candidate algorithms for years that do not have WSP integrated status assessments completed (Pestal et al. 2023). We also did an out-of-sample test for the selected Learning Tree 3 algorithm for CUs that were not used in the learning data set (Pestal et al. 2023). Experts verified statuses in these cases to confirm the applicability of the algorithm(s) to these new data sets.\nTo calculate prediction errors we first converted statuses to scores from 1 = Green to 5 = Red (Table 1). We then calculated the difference between WSP integrated status scores and the rapid status scores (i.e., observed-predicted) (Section 2.4.4 in Pestal et al. 2023). A negative error means that the algorithm predicted a poorer status than the WSP integrated status. Note that candidate algorithms differed in terms of possible outcomes (e.g., whether Red/Amber and Amber/Green options are included), and the status scores were adapted accordingly.\nWe used the following quantitative performance measures to compare algorithm performance for all cases:\n• Number and percent correct: the total number of cases and the percent of cases where the rapid status assigned by the algorithm matches the WSP integrated status (‘true’ status). This measures alignment with Criterion 1. Note that percent correct is calculated from the number of completed cases (see below), not the total number of cases.\n13\n\fPacific Region\nScience Response: Rapid Status Assessments for Pacific Salmon\n• Number and percent over-predicted: the total number and percentage of cases with positive errors in status estimates; where the rapid status assigned by the algorithm is better than the WSP integrated status. This measures alignment with Criterion 2. Percent over- predicted is calculated from the number of completed cases.\n• Number and percent completed: the number and percent of cases where the algorithm was able to generate rapid statuses. This partially measures alignment with Criterion 3 to the extent that different data types and metric availability are represented in the learning data set.\n• Median, mean, and range of prediction errors: summary statistics that describe the\ndistribution of prediction errors and identify any bias.\nIn addition, we cross-tabulated WSP integrated statuses against the WSP rapid statuses predicted by an algorithm. The frequency of each type of possible error resulting from misclassification was estimated. For example, a CU with a Green WSP integrated status that is misclassified by the algorithm as Amber will have the same error of +2 as an Amber CU misclassified as Red, but the biological implications of the error are different. The practical implications of errors were evaluated qualitatively through discussions with CU experts.\nAlgorithm Performance Evaluation\nPerformance was compared across the four fitted and three constructed rapid status algorithms (Tables 2 and 3; Figures 2 and 3). The Learning Tree 3 rapid status algorithm (Figure 1; Table 4) was selected as the best performing among the suite of seven candidate algorithms (Table 2 and 3; Figures 2 and 3; Section 3.2 in Pestal et al. 2023). It is applicable to the largest proportion of CUs in the learning data set (100% of cases), with the highest accuracy (83% correct overall, 84% Fraser Sockeye, and 80% for SBC Chinook and Interior Fraser Coho). It also adheres to the decision-making processes that occurred in the WSP integrated status assessments. Since the Learning Tree 3 algorithm has the highest completion rate for the learning data set, it should also be the algorithm that is most widely applicable to other species and areas (Table 3).\nThe Learning Tree 3 was designed to account for differences in both data type (relative index versus absolute abundance) and metric availability. The Learning Tree 3 provides branch options that are conditional on whether or not certain metrics are available for the CU. Outside of the learning data set, few CUs in the Pacific Region will have absolute or relative abundance metrics available. Flexibility to accommodate differing metric availability is key to ensuring applicability across a broad range of data types across BC and Yukon CUs.\nConfidence Ratings for WSP Rapid Status Learning Tree 3 Algorithm\nGreater confidence in status is associated with some metrics and status results. In the WSP integrated status assessments, assigned statuses were more consistent across experts in some cases over others. In particular, cases that had relative abundance and absolute abundance metrics were more consistently assessed than those with only trend metrics and relative index data (Pestal et al. 2023). To apply these metrics, a CU must have higher quality data to be able to estimate benchmarks, or estimate this metric’s annual value for comparison with its benchmarks. Therefore, we have more confidence in statuses that are assigned using the absolute and relative abundance metrics, than statuses assigned using long-term trend metrics.\nThe long-term trend metric compares a CU’s metric value (ratio of the current generational average spawner abundance to the long-term average) to the metric’s benchmarks. The CU’s value for this metric is influenced by the length of the time series and degree of fisheries\n14\n\fPacific Region\nScience Response: Rapid Status Assessments for Pacific Salmon\nexploitation that occurred early in the time series. This metric can also be calculated for lower quality data, including indices of abundances. For these reasons, this metric was considered less reliable to assess status by experts in past WSP integrated status assessment processes.\nTo account for these differences in confidence identified from past WSP integrated status assessment processes, we used the branches of the algorithm to identify confidence in the statuses being assigned, based on the combination of metrics, metric values, and data types that determine each status node. Through expert judgement we can bin the end nodes into three confidence zones: High, Medium, and Low, and then evaluate this binning by referring to the learning data set CUs that end up in each zone (Section 2.5 in Pestal et al. 2023).\nConfidence ratings below were applied to each end node of the Learning Tree 3 algorithm (Figure 1) as follows:\n• High confidence – Red: either absolute abundance is available and falls below 1.5 times the lower benchmark on this metric (node 3), OR relative abundance benchmarks are available and generational average spawner abundance falls below the lower benchmark (nodes 19 or 23).\n• High confidence – Green: abundance is above the upper benchmark on the absolute\nabundance metric, or this cannot be assessed AND relative abundance benchmarks are available and generational average spawner abundance falls above 1.1 times the upper benchmark (node 36).\n• High confidence – Amber: abundance is above the upper benchmark on the absolute abundance metric, or this cannot be assessed; relative abundance benchmarks are available and generational average spawner abundance fall between the lower and 1.1 times the upper benchmarks (node 37).\n• Medium confidence – Red: (1) absolute abundance falls between the upper and 1.5 times the lower benchmarks and status is based on long-term trend (node 21), or (2) abundance is above the upper benchmark on the absolute abundance metric, or cannot be assessed, relative abundance metrics are not available but status can be assessed based on long-term trends alone (nodes 17) or with both long-term and percent change (short-term) trends (node 33).\n• Medium confidence – Amber: either (1) have relative abundance benchmark and absolute abundance is between the upper and 1.5 time the lower benchmark (node 22), or (2) relative abundance metrics are not available, but absolute abundance is between the upper benchmark and 1.5 times the lower benchmark, and based on long-term trend (node 20).\n• Low confidence – Amber: abundance falls above the upper benchmark on the absolute\nabundance metric, or cannot be evaluated on this metric, and relative abundance metrics are not available so CU status is assessed based on long-term trend and percent change (node 65).\n• Low confidence – Green: abundance falls above the upper benchmark on the absolute\nabundance metric, or cannot be evaluated on this metric; relative abundance metrics are not available; status is based on trends alone (long-term and percent change) (node 64).\nRapid statuses assigned by the Learning Tree 3 were categorized as High, Medium or Low confidence for most of the 65 cases in the learning data set (Section 3.3 in Pestal et al. 2023; Table 5). These confidence ratings were compared to the errors between the rapid statuses and the WSP integrated statuses (considered ‘true’ statuses). Given the high overall success rate of this algorithm, there were only a few errors. Specifically, there were five cases where the\n15\n\fPacific Region\nScience Response: Rapid Status Assessments for Pacific Salmon\nalgorithm assigned a better status than the WSP integrated statuses, and did so with High confidence. These are the outcomes we would want to minimize, since they are less precautionary.\nIn all five cases, the discrepancy between WSP rapid and integrated statuses is small, and can be readily explained by the additional information considered in the expert deliberations, as documented in the status narratives for each CU within the WSP assessment reports (Appendix B in Pestal et al. 2023). In all of these cases, Learning Tree 3 generates rapid statuses that match the starting point for the experts’ status discussions, but the algorithm cannot capture the nuances of additional information used in the workshop consensus to downgrade the statuses by half a category (i.e., from Amber to Red/Amber or from Green to Amber/Green). On the 3- status scale, these half-category statuses were then simplified to the lower status (i.e., Red/Amber became Red, Amber/Green became Amber), and therefore these show up as a full category error in the comparison.\nOut-of-Samples Test: Applying Learning Tree to CUs and Years without WSP Integrated Status Assessments\nWe evaluated the application of the Learning Tree 3 rapid status algorithm to years and CUs that currently do not have WSP integrated statuses assigned (Table 6; Pestal et al. In prep1). Six salmon case studies, with a total of 105 CUs, were used for this evaluation (Table 6). This includes three groups of salmon not previously assessed for WSP integrated status: Skeena- Nass Sockeye, Fraser Pink and Fraser Chum. This also includes the three groups of salmon previously assessed: Fraser Sockeye, Southern BC Chinook and Interior Fraser Coho. For these latter three, the evaluation of WSP rapid status is expanded to years with no WSP integrated statuses assigned. Each CU and year with sufficient data was assigned a WSP Red, Amber or Green rapid status and High, Medium or Low confidence rating.\nThere were a total of 69 CUs where a WSP rapid status could be assigned to at least one year of data (Table 6). There were 36 CUs for which WSP rapid statuses could not be assigned for any year due to insufficient data or other considerations (Table 6). Summaries for each CU, showing spawner abundance trends, metrics, and rapid statuses over time, are provided in Appendices A–G in Pestal et al. (In prep.1). An example CU showing the summary information is presented in Figure 4.\nWSP rapid statuses for Fraser Pink, Fraser Chum, and Skeena/Nass Sockeye Salmon were reviewed by CU experts from DFO Stock Assessment (Interior Fraser Area and North Coast Areas). These experts agreed that data compilation and treatment methods, metric calculations, and WSP rapid status outputs were relevant and accurate according to their expert knowledge of the available data sets. Out-of-sample WSP rapid status results for Fraser Sockeye, Coho, and Southern BC Chinook were generated using the same data treatment methods and metric calculations previously reviewed and applied in the WSP integrated status assessments. DFO stock assessment experts reviewed the out-of-sample WSP rapid status outputs for these CUs.\nFor Fraser Sockeye, Southern BC Chinook and Interior Fraser Coho, the Learning Tree 3 algorithm was able to assign rapid statuses to the years before and after the WSP integrated status assessments were conducted (Table 7). This was expected, since the rapid status algorithm was designed using past WSP integrated status assessments for these CU groups in the learning data set (Pestal et al. 2023). These CUs covered both absolute abundance and relative index data types and included a range of metric availability.\nThe application of WSP rapid statuses to Skeena-Nass Sockeye, Fraser Pink, and Fraser Chum CUs increased the number of assessed CUs to 69 from 43 CUs previously assessed through\n16\n\fPacific Region\nScience Response: Rapid Status Assessments for Pacific Salmon\nWSP integrated status assessments (Table 6). This was anticipated since the Learning Tree 3 algorithm had the highest completion rate for the learning data set (Pestal et al. 2023), and is applicable to other species and areas. Also, the new data sets met minimum data requirements to assess WSP rapid status. Learning Tree 3 was designed to account for differences in both data type and metric availability through its multiple branch options. This flexibility is key to ensuring applicability across CUs both within the learning data set and as the algorithm is applied to additional data sets in the future.\nThe number of CUs that can be assessed has generally increased over time, and the relative mix of Red, Amber, and Green assigned statuses has changed. Specifically, across all 105 CUs in the six case studies, the percentage of Red and Amber CU statuses increased over time, and, conversely, the percentage of Green CU statuses decreased (Table 8; Figure 5). The same pattern is observed when looking at only the CUs where a status could be assigned each year. For example, Table 8 shows that:\n• For 1995, WSP rapid statuses could be assigned to 36 CUs. Seven were assigned Red status (19% of assessable CUs, 7% of all CUs), 14 were assigned Amber status (39% of assessable CUs, 13% of all CUs), and 15 were assigned Green status (42% of assessable CUs, 14% of all CUs) (Table 8).\n• For 2018, one of two years when the largest number of CUs could be assessed (67 out of\n105 CUs in the six case studies), there were a total of 28 CUs with Red rapid statuses (42% of assessable CUs, 27% of all CUs), 29 CUs assigned Amber status (43% of assessable CUs, 27% of all CUs), and 10 CUs assigned Green status (15% of assessable CUs, 10% of all CUs) (Table 8).\nAny unassessed years are due to data deficiencies, including no surveys, no assessment of sites classified as ‘wild’, and unresolved questions regarding data treatment.\nSince the last WSP integrated status assessments, the WSP rapid statuses indicate that statuses have deteriorated for many CUs (Sec. 4.2 of Pestal et al. 2023). Specifically, WSP rapid statuses for 11 of the 23 Fraser Sockeye CUs, and for 4 of the 15 Southern BC Chinook CUs with enough data from wild sites to complete an assessment (Sec. 4.2 of Pestal et al. 2023) deteriorated. This highlights the urgent need for up-to-date status assessments and demonstrates the usefulness of the recommended algorithm.\nSensitivity Analyses\nThe relative abundance metric sensitivity test compared how rapid statuses changed when this metric was included or excluded from a candidate algorithm (Table 9). The relative abundance metric was available for 37 of the 65 cases in the learning data set. Details on what CUs included this metric included are available in a separate report (see Section 3.5 in Pestal et al. 2023).\nCompletion rate was almost 100% for the three Learning Tree algorithms for this sensitivity analysis. As the Learning Tree evolved from 1 to 3, the algorithm became more consistent in the statuses assigned with the relative abundance metric versus without. Statuses changed when the relative abundance metric was removed for the following number of cases: Learning Tree 1: 17/37 cases; Learning Tree 2: 13/37 cases; Learning Tree 3: 9/37 cases (Table 9).\nLearning Tree 3 is more precautionary when the relative abundance metric is not available, compared to when it is available, and compared to Learning Trees 1 and 2. In most cases (7/9), the rapid status assigned with less information (i.e., without the relative abundance metric) was\n17\n\fPacific Region\nScience Response: Rapid Status Assessments for Pacific Salmon\npoorer than with it included (Table 9: Number Worse by 1 status zone: 5; Number Worse by 2 status zones: 2; out of the total Number Changed: 9).\nLayers of Precaution\nWe chose to be precautionary at multiple stages of the WSP rapid status algorithm process to align this approach with the WSP integrated status assessment approach, which provides ‘true’ CU statuses. Precautionary actions taken were:\n\nTo evaluate algorithm performance, we downgraded mixed WSP integrated statuses to the\n\npoorer of the two statuses (Red/Amber became Red, Amber/Green became Amber).\n\nIn the evaluation of alternative algorithms, we looked at the direction of errors and\n\nconsidered underestimates of status (e.g., assigning Red status to an Amber CU) less of a concern than overestimates of status (e.g., assigning a Green status to an Amber CU). This relates to criterion 2 in the previous Performance Criteria section).\n\nIn the Learning Tree 3 algorithm:\n\n\nwe included a buffer of 500 above the COSEWIC absolute abundance Criterion D1\n\nthreshold of 1,000 for small population size; the threshold for this metric is set at 1,500. This was to account for how this metric was treated by experts in the workshops, where CU statuses were downgraded if one year in a generation fell below 1,000, if the estimates were considered uncertain, or if the generational average was close to the 1,000 threshold.\n\nsimilar to the buffer on the absolute abundance metric lower benchmark (previous bullet),\n\nwe added a 10% buffer to the upper threshold of the relative abundance metric.\nThis level of precaution in the WSP rapid status assessment approach is consistent with the approach taken by experts in the completed WSP integrated status assessments (Appendix B in Pestal et al. 2023; Grant and Pestal 2012; DFO 2015, 2016; Grant et al. 2020). This is demonstrated by the relatively low error between CU statuses generated by the WSP rapid status algorithm compared to the ‘true’ status, provided by past expert-driven WSP integrated status assessments (Table 5).\nExamples of where experts in the WSP integrated status assessment processes included precautionary approaches are provided below:\n•\nIn the WSP integrated status assessment processes, the relative abundance metric drove status designations where it was available. In evaluating this metric, experts considered the consistency in status across all probability levels (10% to 90%) of the estimated benchmarks to determine status. If statuses were mixed across probability levels, status was down- weighed towards the lower status level, or a mixed status was assigned (e.g., Red/Amber or Amber/Green) (Appendix B in Pestal et al. 2023). The WSP rapid status approach compares the current generational average (or ‘dominant’ cycle, in the case of Fraser Sockeye cyclic CUs), to the median (50% probability level) estimates of the relative abundance benchmarks, instead of presenting the full probability distribution of the benchmarks. Since this metric is so heavily relied upon in status designations, using only the median benchmarks in the WSP rapid status algorithm has the potential to assign overly optimistic statuses in comparison to the WSP integrated status approaches. The three decisions listed above were therefore made to remain consistent with the degree of caution applied in the expert-driven processes.\n18\n\fPacific Region\nScience Response: Rapid Status Assessments for Pacific Salmon\n• When considering absolute abundance in WSP integrated status workshops, experts\nconsidered uncertainty in the data, and also compared each of the past four to twelve years to the COSEWIC criterion D1 (small population size) threshold of 1,000. In contrast, the algorithm compares the last generation average abundance to the COSEWIC threshold. To make this algorithm threshold more consistent with the precautionary approach used by experts in the WSP integrated status approach, a buffer was added. The buffer accounts for data uncertainty, and some of the masking of individual low abundance years (falling below the 1,000 COSEWIC threshold) that might occur, when averaged together with larger abundance years in the most recent generation. The buffer of 500 increases the COSEWIC metric threshold to 1,500 in the algorithm.\nNote that biological thresholds for WSP rapid status are currently stationary. They do not consider deteriorating salmon productivity observed for many salmon CUs (Dorner et al. 2008, 2018; Grant et al. 2019, 2021). As the climate continues to change and habitats continue to deteriorate due to human activities, larger salmon population size thresholds may be required to ensure a CU’s persistence under these conditions (McElhany et al. 2000). See next steps section below on consideration of time-varying productivity in the WSP rapid status approach.\nConclusions\nThe Learning Tree 3 algorithm (Tables 2 and 4; Figure 1) was used to provide annual WSP rapid statuses for Pacific salmon CUs with applicable data in BC and the Yukon. This algorithm estimated Red, Amber or Green CU statuses annually with High, Medium or Low confidence. This algorithm performed best across a suite of seven candidate algorithms on CUs with previous WSP integrated status assessments (Tables 2–3; Figures 2–3; Section 3.2 in Pestal et al. 2023). Further, out-of-samples testing was conducted on years and CUs without previous WSP integrated status assessments to further validate the use of the WSP rapid status algorithm (Table 8; Figure 5). Combined, these performance evaluations included 105 CUs, covering all five species of Pacific salmon DFO manages: Sockeye, Chinook, Coho, Pink and Chum. It also spanned a broad geographic area including the following: Fraser River, Skeena and Nass watersheds, Inner South Coast, and West Coast of Vancouver Island.\nThe WSP rapid status approach ensures that statuses are scientifically objective, consistent, and comparable across BC and Yukon salmon CUs. It also ensures that they are relatively easy to implement, broadly applicable to data rich and data poor CUs, and can be updated annually. This approach is grounded in the principles of conservation biology, which emphasize using abundance and trends in abundance criteria to evaluate conservation risk (Caughly 1994; Mace et al. 2009). It is also grounded in past scientific research and processes where CUs were identified (Holtby and Ciruna 2007; Grant et al. 2011; Brown et al. 2019), and CU statuses were assigned (Holt 2009, 2010; Holt et al. 2009; Grant et al. 2011, 2020; Grant and Pestal 2013; DFO 2015, 2016).\nThe WSP rapid status algorithm is designed to be flexible. It can assess status for CUs that have different data types: absolute abundance or indices of abundance; and metric availability. It can improve as more CUs are added for status assessments, and as new methods are developed to consider time-varying productivity in relative abundance benchmarks, distribution information, etc. It is named the Learning Tree for this reason. We recommend that prior to including new metrics in the algorithm, expert-driven WSP integrated status assessments are conducted to ground-truth the effects of new metrics on WSP status determinations.\nTo demonstrate the flexibility of the WSP rapid status algorithm, it was successfully applied to the full time-series of data available for the CUs in the learning data set: Fraser Sockeye, Southern BC Chinook and Interior Fraser Coho CUs (Pestal et al. 2023; Pestal et al. In prep.1).\n19\n\fPacific Region\nScience Response: Rapid Status Assessments for Pacific Salmon\nIt was also successfully applied to CU groups that did not have completed WSP integrated status assessments: Skeena/Nass Sockeye and Fraser Pink and Chum CUs (Pestal et al. In prep1). WSP rapid status summaries for these 65 CUs indicate that that statuses have deteriorated over time; the percentage Red and Amber CUs have increased, relative to Green (Figure 5).\nThe WSP rapid status approach can be used by experts to support scientific exploration and help them to incorporate science into decision-making processes. WSP rapid status assessments support the evaluation of Pacific salmon SMU statuses relative to their LRP’s (Holt et al. 2023a, 2023b; DFO 2023). The assessment of SMU LRPs is a legal obligation prescribed under the revised Fisheries Act’s new Fish Stock Provisions. WSP rapid statuses and their underlying data can also be used to track and detect patterns in annual salmon CU statuses, support climate change vulnerability assessments, and may also support the prioritization and evaluation of hatchery, harvest and habitat management actions.\nOngoing/Future Work\n\nDevelop a Data Management Strategy for WSP rapid status inputs\n\nA DFO data management strategy is recommended as the key next step. This step would enable the expansion of WSP rapid status assessments across all BC and Yukon CUs with applicable data, and also provide annual updates to each CU’s rapid statuses. Due to DFO’s Pacific Salmon Strategy, there is currently both increased resourcing, and an opportunity to put these pieces in place to ensure that all applicable Pacific Salmon CU data are available annually to assess WSP rapid statuses. Note, we assume DFO Area Stock Assessment leads integrate expertise from Indigenous groups, NGOs, consultants and others in the management of CU stock assessment data. We recommend the following roles and responsibilities as a starting point for consideration, and expect these to evolve as the data management strategy emerges:\nDFO Pacific Salmon Strategy Initiative (PSSI) Data Policy and Analytics Team\n• Create and maintain a central database (DB) to warehouse annual composite data for WSP rapid status assessments, and the annual CU WSP rapid statuses, and available WSP integrated statuses. These data would be accessible to DFO staff and external groups such as Indigenous communities, COSEWIC, IUCN, academics, and the Pacific Salmon Foundation.\nDFO Science: Data Management Unit (DMU)\n• Establish governance by ensuring annual CU composite data for WSP rapid status\nassessments and WSP rapid statuses are provided by DFO Stock Assessment leads.\n• Automate data treatment steps where possible, including development of appropriate\ncomputer code packages and input specification files in collaboration with PSSI Data Policy and Analytics Team and DFO Stock Assessment leads.\n• Ensure standardization in approaches across CUs and years by working directly with Stock\nAssessment leads, and with support from State of Salmon (SOS) leads for new CUs.\nArea and Core DFO Stock Assessment\n• Set up data treatment and specification files for the WSP rapid status application for new CU data sets (following data steps in previous data section) in collaboration with SOS leads and DMU.\n20\n\fPacific Region\nScience Response: Rapid Status Assessments for Pacific Salmon\n• Provide annual selected and treated data for WSP rapid status application to DMU.\n• Support the automation of data treatment steps where possible, including the development of appropriate computer code packages and input files in collaboration with the DMU.\n• Support standardization processes across groups of CUs led by DMU.\nDFO Science: State of the Salmon (SOS) Program (Authors of current paper)\n• Work with DFO Stock Assessment leads to determine data needs and metric specifications for WSP rapid statuses for new CU data sets being added (following data steps in previous data section).\n• Provide annual time series of WSP rapid statuses and their associated data sets to DMU\nDB. Pull data from database and update rapid statuses.\n\nImproving End-User Access\n\nDFO’s new Salmon Scanner data visualization tool for Pacific salmon will provide interactive displays of the rapid statuses generated by the Learning Tree 3 algorithm, and their underlying data (Sections 4.5 in Pestal et al. 2023). DFO’s Salmon Scanner has been developed and will be released shortly. This tool was developed as an R-Shiny application. Shiny is a widely used freeware with many applications in fisheries science and decision support. It has been designed as a code package to be run on R, but can also be used in a browser format. DFO’s Salmon Scanner generates data by calculating annual WSP rapid statuses for Pacific Salmon CUs. It also centralizes and makes key salmon data readily available to experts, including escapement, recruitment, life-history, and spawner distribution.\n\nAlgorithm Revisions as Required\n\nRevising the WSP rapid status algorithm can include directly altering the decision-tree, or adding new metrics. Such revisions or improvements may be identified as new CU data sets are assessed. In such cases, we recommend that experts perform additional WSP integrated status assessments to expand the learning data set. WSP integrated status assessment processes should include DFO, Indigenous groups, and other experts, similar to past processes. With the existing or updated learning data set, performance of the WSP rapid status algorithm should be re-evaluated and compared between the existing algorithm and new proposed algorithm revisions. This would ensure that the algorithm’s performance improves overall when compared to the ‘true’ statuses, versus hyper-tuning the algorithm to particular CU cases.\nAdditional metrics could be added to the Learning Tree 3 algorithm. New metric considerations, however, should align with the WSP emphasis on ‘standardized monitoring of [Pacific] salmon status’ (DFO 2005; Holt et al. 2009).\nWhile there is a considerable amount of ancillary information (fish disease or parasite prevenance, genetics, fish behavior, etc.) that could be included to assess salmon status, we do not recommend using these sources of information for the WSP rapid status approach. Instead we recommend continuing to emphasize standardized metrics and additional information that focuses on abundance and trends in abundance at this time (Appendix A in Pestal et al. 2023; Holt et al. 2009; Holt 2009; Grant et al. 2011; Grant and Pestal 2013; DFO 2015, 2016; Grant et al. 2020b). These status metrics are based on conservation biology theory, particularly with emphasis on two paradigms: small population size and declining population (Caughley 1994; Mace et al. 2008).\nA distribution metric is not currently included in the WSP rapid status algorithm. Distribution metrics were included in a WSP status toolkit (Holt et al. 2009), and CU distribution trends were\n21\n\fPacific Region\nScience Response: Rapid Status Assessments for Pacific Salmon\nprovided in the Southern BC Chinook and Interior Fraser Coho integrated status assessment processes. However distribution information did not influence WSP integrated statuses (Appendix B in Pestal et al. 2023; DFO 2015, 2016). Further, no benchmarks have been resolved for distribution metrics through expert processes or research.\nDistribution metrics might be particularly important for broadly distributed CUs, like those of Chum and Pink Salmon. Considerable information on spawning distribution exists among salmon experts within DFO and among Indigenous communities and other groups. If work is done to develop benchmarks and explore their use by experts in WSP integrated status assessment processes, distribution metrics could be added to subsequent iterations of the Learning Tree 3 algorithm. However, another important consideration is how broadly available these data will be across CUs, and how readily they can be updated annually.\nDistribution information might be more relevant for subsequent steps involving the use of rapid statuses, rather than in the evaluation of status. For example, information on changes within a CU’s spawning or juvenile rearing distribution should be captured when developing recovery or rebuilding plans.\n\nAdding or updating relative-abundance benchmarks for CUs, including\n\nincorporating time varying productivity into benchmarks.\nRelative-abundance metric benchmarks should be added and updated for CUs where possible. Although WSP rapid statuses can be developed without relative-abundance metrics, the confidence in rapid statuses increases when these metrics are applied.\nThese benchmarks are added by CU experts, based on their knowledge of the applicability of the data to this metric. There are CUs we have included in the current assessment, like Fraser Pink and Chum CUs, where experts did not provide relative-abundance metric benchmarks, and therefore, the relative-abundance metric was not included. An evaluation of whether or not stock-recruitment, habitat capacity or percentile benchmarks are applicable to these CUs is recommended in order to potentially assess the WSP rapid statuses of these CUs with higher confidence.\nPercentile benchmarks could be considered in cases where stock-recruitment or habitat- capacity benchmarks are unavailable, and where applicable spawner abundance data exist. However, percentile benchmarks have been shown to be appropriate only for CUs with moderate to high productivity over their time-series (&gt;2.5 recruits per spawner) and low to moderate harvest rates (&lt;40%) (see Table 6 in Holt et al. 2018).\nBroad declines in Canadian salmon abundances and productivity suggest that time-varying productivity should be considered in the relative abundance metric benchmarks. This is recommended for CUs where persistent changes in abundances and productivity have occurred. Time-varying productivity benchmarks, estimated from stock-recruitment models, were used in the first WSP integrated status assessment process for Fraser Sockeye (Grant et al. 2011; Grant and Pestal 2013). However, these were not included in the subsequent WSP integrated status assessment since statuses of these CUs had returned to average, relative to the previous five years of poor productivity (Grant et al. 2020). Therefore, the more recent WSP integrated status assessment for Fraser Sockeye CUs relied on models that considered average productivity for each CU (Grant et al. 2021). Since this last assessment, however, productivity declines have resumed. Further, since climate change is expected to continue to significantly change the quality of ecosystems and habitats, persistent CU productivity and distribution changes are expected (Bush and Lemmen 2019; Cheung and Frölicher 2020; IPCC 2021).\n22\n\fPacific Region\nScience Response: Rapid Status Assessments for Pacific Salmon\nIncorporating time-varying productivity into relative abundance benchmarks is challenging when CU productivity has not stabilized (Peterman et al. 2003; Dorner et al. 2008, 2018; Malick et al. 2017), and when large productivity shifts continue to occur between years (Grant et al. 2021). Questions to consider include: how often to adjust benchmarks to account for time-varying CU productivity; how to interpret status over time if benchmarks are adjusted frequently, or are not adjusted despite productivity changes; and how to ensure consistency in applying time-varying productivity considerations to benchmarks in the WSP rapid status algorithm. Work is ongoing in DFO to investigate these types of questions and develop guidelines with regard to developing and applying time-varying productivity to status and other applications such as forecasts (C.A Holt, DFO, pers. comm.).\n\nExplore revisions to data sets with hatchery influence using the Proportionate\n\nNatural Influence (PNI) in salmon CU statuses.\nHatcheries are expected to play an increasing role in the conservation of salmon CUs. Hatchery enhancement programs are being expanded for this purpose through DFO’s Pacific Salmon Strategy Initiative (PSSI). Although all WSP integrated status assessments to date have attempted to exclude hatchery populations (Grant et al. 2011; Brown et al. 2019), this may be increasingly challenging to do going forward given the larger role hatcheries will play in salmon conservation.\nRecent work explores Proportionate Natural Influence (PNI) in hatchery influenced salmon populations (Withler et al. 2018). The PNI is a metric used to assess the genetic risks of hatchery production on natural populations as an index of gene flow. Guidance provided in a recent publication is being considered for adjusting which salmon populations should be included for a CU status assessment, depending on the level of PNI (see Table 3 in Withler et al. 2018).\n\nApplying WSP rapid statuses in formal decision making processes\n\nThis Canadian Science Advisory Secretariate (CSAS) review of the WSP rapid status assessment approach was requested by DFO Science Branch to support the evaluation of Pacific salmon Stock Management Unit (SMU) statuses relative to their Limit Reference Points (LRPs). An SMU defines a group of one or more Pacific salmon CUs that are managed together with the objective of achieving a joint status. The LRP represents the status below which serious harm is occurring to the stock, based on biological criteria established by DFO Science through peer review. An SMU below its LRP triggers a rebuilding plan. A recent CSAS process recommended that LRPs for SMUs be defined as a percentage, with the objective being that 100% of all CUs in the SMU are above the WSP Red status zone (DFO 2023; Holt et al. 2023a, 2023b). An SMU falls below the LRP if one or more CUs in an SMU are in the WSP Red status zone. The WSP rapid status approach was recommended for assessing LRP status (DFO 2023; Holt et al. 2023a). Through the current CSAS process, reported here, a recommended next step is the vetting of the individual CU WSP rapid status results, and LRP status determination, by experts in a structured process.\nThe WSP rapid statuses with expert input could also be combined with non-science considerations prior to and after rebuilding plans are triggered:\n• Before rebuilding plans are triggered by science, SMUs are prioritized for consideration in\nthe rebuilding plan process. Prioritization includes both scientific and resource management considerations. Prioritization could include combining WSP rapid statuses with expert input to determine whether or not the SMU is below its LRP. However, prioritization also includes other social, cultural, economic and other factors such as considerations of First Nations\n23\n\fPacific Region\nScience Response: Rapid Status Assessments for Pacific Salmon\nFood, Social and Ceremonial (FSC) needs, international treaty obligations, various stakeholder interests, the vulnerability of CUs to climate change, and more.\n• After rebuilding plans are triggered by science/expert input, determination of rebuilding actions is led by resource management, with scientific inputs. SMU statuses, based on statuses of individual CUs within the LRP process, could be used to help isolate the particular CUs that require rebuilding considerations. This would help to narrow down the scope of the rebuilding plan. It could also help narrow down the type of actions taken broadly. For example, though a small but persistent CU may not need specific actions to increase its population size (i.e., rebuild), it likely would require increased protection and maintenance of its existing habitat, due to its small and restricted geographic range and increased extinction risk. CUs of Pink or Chum Salmon, for example, span broad geographic areas in freshwater, therefore, the risk of environmental change or catastrophe are moderated. In contrast, smaller Sockeye CUs are likely much more vulnerable to any perturbation or extreme event, which is occurring at an increasing frequency due to climate change.\nOther applications of the WSP rapid statuses, when combined with expert input, may include the following:\n• State of salmon reporting: trends in salmon CU statuses can be presented by area, species, life-history, and stock management units. By combining expert input with WSP rapid status information, and other information providing in DFO’s Salmon Scanner, regular reporting on state of the salmon can be provided.\n• Prioritization of hatchery, harvest, habitat management actions: there is an increasing number of stocks of concern, and therefore, increasing demand for management interventions. Annual CU WSP rapid statuses and trends may be one input that can support prioritization activities. Other science-based inputs to support prioritization may also include the future vulnerability of CUs to climate change (see next bullet). Other non-science inputs may also be required in prioritization processes, such as Indigenous FSC priorities, international treaty obligations, etc.\n• Climate change vulnerability assessments (CCVAs): climate change is a key factor\ninfluencing salmon and their ecosystems. CCVAs should be completed to determine salmon CU vulnerability to projected ongoing change. Salmon statuses could provide a key input to CCVAs, and DFO’s Salmon Scanner could provide a way to quickly compare and contrast, and test high level hypotheses for which salmon are more or less vulnerable to projected changes. These assessments may include additional information provided by DFO Science on climate change projections in freshwater/marine ecosystems, salmon responses, and more.\n24\n\fPacific Region\nScience Response: Rapid Status Assessments for Pacific Salmon\nTables\nTable 1. Alternative status scales for evaluating algorithm performance. WSP rapid statuses were converted to scores from 1–5 to capture the magnitude and direction of classification errors. WSP rapid statuses need to be simplified to the same scale as the WSP integrated status assessments to make meaningful comparisons within an algorithm and between algorithms. See Section 2.4.4 in Pestal et al. 2023 for more details. The 5 status scale is the scale used in previous WSP integrated status assessments (Grant and Pestal 2013; Grant et al. 2020; DFO 2015, 2016). Different WSP rapid status candidate algorithms were developed to assess status on one of the three scales (see Table 2), with statuses converted to each of the three scales for performance evaluation (Table 3; Section 2.4.4 in Pestal et al. 2023).\n5 Status Scale\n3 Status Scale\n2 Status Scale\nZone\nRed\nRed / Amber\nAmber\nAmber / Green\nGreen\nScore Zone\nScore Zone\nScore\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\nRed\nAmber\nGreen\nRed\nNot Red\n5\n2\n5\n3\n1\n25\n\fPacific Region\nScience Response: Rapid Status Assessments for Pacific Salmon\nTable 2. The seven candidate rapid status algorithms. Three fitted algorithms based on exploring alternative CART model fits, and four constructed algorithms based on combining CART fits with additional considerations. The fitted algorithms used all 65 cases from the learning data set. Exploratory CART fits using data split by species or data type were unstable and were therefore not included in the shortlist of candidate algorithms for detailed testing. Constructed algorithms use components of the fitted algorithms, so indirectly use all available data. This table summarizes the design approach for each algorithm. Section 2.4 in Pestal et al. 2023 describes the development steps. Appendix D in Pestal et al. 2023 shows the full algorithms as a diagram and as a set of classification rules. Note that these algorithms generate rapid statuses at different scales of resolution, from 5 (Red, Red/Amber, Amber, Amber/Green, Green), to 3 (Red, Amber, Green) to 2 (Red, NotRed), as shown by the ‘x’ in the right-hand columns (R = Red, nR = notRed, RA = Red/Amber, A = Amber, AG = Amber/Green, G = Green) (see Table 3).\nType Fitted\nName Minimalist Appendix E.1*\nDescription • 3 status scale: simplified status scale • Built using only the values for trend\nmetrics: long-term & short-term trend, which are broadly available metrics common to most CUs\n• Tree fitting with high complexity penalty to generate a simple tree with few branches.\nR nR RA A AG G X X\nX\n\n\n\n\n\nFancyPants Appendix E.2*\nCategorical Realist Appendix E.3*\nConstructed Simply Red\nAppendix E.4*\nLearning Tree 1 Appendix E.5*\nLearning Tree 2 Appendix E.6 Learning Tree 3 Appendix E.7\n• 5 status scale: matches WSP integrated\nX\n\n\n\nX\nX\nX\nX\nstatus scale\n• Built using values for all available metrics • Tree fitting with low complexity penalty to generate a more complex tree with finer resolution with more branches.\n• 2 status scale: simplified status scale • Simplified metrics: absolute abundance, relative abundance and long-term trend • Fit separate trees for different data types,\nbut only R and A were isolated as terminal nodes by the tree fit.\n• 2 status scale: simplified status scale • Simplified metrics: long-term & short-term\ntrend, and relative abundance\n• Combines all the criteria from the other\nalgorithms that flag a Red status • 3 status scale: simplified status scale • Built on the CART algorithms but\ncombined with WSP integrated status assessment narratives (Appendix B in Pestal et al. 2023).\n• 3 status scale: simplified status scale • Same as Learning Tree 1 but use R/A/G statuses instead of calculated metric values.\n• 3 status scale: simplified status scale • Evolution of Learning Tree 1, putting\nabsolute abundance first, and providing additional considerations for long-term trend and percent change metrics.\nX\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\nX\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\nX\nX\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\nX\nX\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\nX\n*in Pestal et al. (2023).\n26\n\fPacific Region\nScience Response: Rapid Status Assessments for Pacific Salmon\nTable 3. Summary of algorithm performance across all 65 cases in the learning set: Fraser Sockeye, Southern BC Chinook and Interior Fraser Coho CUs. Note in the learning set there are two years with WSP integrated status assessments completed for Fraser Sockeye CUs, in addition to one year for Southern BC Chinook CUs and one year for Interior Fraser Coho CUs. The table shows the completion rate (Number Complete): the number of cases the algorithm could assign a status to out of the total 65 learning data set cases; number of correct designations (Number Correct): the rapid status matches WSP integrated status; the number of close designations (Number Close): the rapid status is only 1 step different from the WSP integrated status; and the number of overestimates (Number Predicted a Better Status): the rapid status is better than the WSP integrated status. Median, Mean and Range of Errors are presented in the last 3 rows. All errors are calculated by converting status designations to a 2, 3, or 5-status scale (Tables 1 and 2). The status scale that matches the algorithm is marked with an asterisk, bold font and grey shading. A negative error means that the algorithm assigned a worse status than the integrated expert assessment. Table cells are highlighted in orange and marked with two asterisks if a rapid status could be assigned for less than 3/4 of the cases (Number Complete &lt; 49/65), or if the mean error was larger than 0.3 (Mean &lt; -0.3 or Mean &gt; 0.3).\nFancy Pants 54\nCategorical Realist 55\nSimply Red 55\nLearning Tree 1 65\nLearning Tree 2 65\nLearning Tree 3 65\nMinimalist\n64\n39\n49* 55\n54\n49* 55\n8\n8* 6\n0\n0* 0\n0.25\n0* -0.14\nPerformance Measure Number Complete Number Correct\nNumber Close\nNumber that Predicted a Better Status\nMedian Error\nMean Error\nRange of Error\nStatus Scale -\n5 3\n2\n5\n3\n2\n5\n3 2\n5\n3 2\n5\n3\n2\n5 3\n2\n47* 49\n50\n50* 49\n50\n2* 1 0\n0* 0 0\n0.2* 0.19\n0.22\n-2 to 4\n-2 to 4* -3 to 4\n-1 to 4* -2 to 4\n0 to 4\n30\n41* 50\n44\n41* 50\n5\n5* 5\n0\n0* 0\n23 26\n47* 47\n47\n47*\n10\n17\n2*\n0\n0\n0*\n39\n46* 58\n55\n46* 58\n17\n17* 6\n0\n0* 0\n41\n48* 58\n58\n48* 58\n16\n16* 7\n0\n0* 0\n44\n54* 59\n60\n54* 59\n7\n7* 4\n0\n0* 0\n0.4\n0.15* -0.27\n-2 to 2\n-2 to 2* -3 to 2\n0.27\n0.02\n0.22*\n-2 to 4 -3 to 4\n-3 to 4*\n-0.23\n-0.49** -0.23\n-4 to 4\n-4 to 4* -3 to 4\n-0.23\n-0.49 -0.32 -4 to 2\n-4 to 2* -3 to 2\n0.2\n-0.06* -0.09\n-2 to 4\n-2 to 4* -3 to 4\n27\n\fPacific Region\nScience Response: Rapid Status Assessments for Pacific Salmon\nTable 4.

WSP rapid statuses are either one of the three status zones (Red, Amber, Green) or None if there is at least one status metric available but no rapid status could be determined.\nSpecies Chinook Chum Coho Pink Sockeye Total\nWSP Rapid Status\nWSP Integrated Status Number Red Amber Green Number Red Amber Green None 300 24 25 8 115 472\n553 25 125 13 1.100 1.816\n123 1 87 3 417 631\n119 0 4 2 290 415\n11 0 9 0 278 298\n2 0 0 0 8 10\n15 0 5 0 45 65\n12 0 0 0 20 32\n1 0 5 0 17 23\n30\n\fPacific Region\nScience Response: Rapid Status Assessments for Pacific Salmon\nTable 8. The assessment of WSP rapid statuses for 105 CUs in the case studies, from 1995–2018. Number Rapid Status column shows the total number of CUs where a WSP rapid status could be assigned in each year. Of these cases, the percentage of Red (% Red Column) and Amber (% Amber Column) CU statuses increased, and conversely, the percentage of Green (% Green Column) CU statuses decreased over time. The final three columns are the percentage of CUs that could be assessed (% of CUs Assessed), versus unassessed (% of CUs Unassessed), and the percentages assigned a Red status (% Red), when compared to the total number of CUs in the case studies (105).

Summary of the relative abundance metric sensitivity test that compares how rapid statuses change when this metric was included or excluded from a CU’s metric set. The relative abundance metric is available for 37 of the 65 cases in the learning data set. This metric is used by the following algorithms: Categorical Realist, Simply Red, and Learning Tree 1, 2, and 3. The Minimalist does not use the relative abundance metric, so it was excluded. The Categorical Realist and Simply Red were included, but since they are relatively simple, they cannot assign statuses for 37/37 and 25/37 cases, respectively. This table shows the number of cases where the algorithm could assign status (Number Completed) versus where the algorithm could not assign a status (Number Not Completed). This is presented for the two scenarios: With and Without the relative abundance metric (RA). It also shows the number of cases where the rapid status changed, as well as the direction and magnitude of the changes. Notable results are highlighted in orange and marked with two asterisks. A single asterisk denotes where excluding the relative abundance metric results in an incomplete status for Chilliwack-ES Sockeye, which is an exceptional case (see Section 3.5 in Pestal 2023 for the description of the Chilliwack-ES sockeye CU exception).\nFitted\nConstructed\nLearning Tree\nSimply Red 36 1 12 25**\nLT1 37 0 36 1* 0 17 2 0 1 0 0 13 1 0\nLT2 LT3 37 0 36 1* 9** 5 2 2 0\n37 0 36 1* 13** 5 1 7 0\nWith RA metric\nWithout RA metric\nMeasure Number Completed Number Not Completed Number Completed Number Not Completed Number Changed Number Worse by 1 status zone Number Worse by 2 status zones Number Better by 1 status zone Number Better by 2 status zones\nCategorical Realist 37 0 0 37** 0 0 0 0 0\n32\n\fPacific Region\nScience Response: Rapid Status Assessments for Pacific Salmon\nFigures\nFigure 1. WSP rapid status Learning Tree 3 algorithm (Table 4 includes written descriptions). To assess a CU, metric values are compared to thresholds presented at each decision point. Yes or No answers split each path of the decision tree, terminating at WSP rapid status assignments. The different splits are identified as nodes: 1 to 65. Pathway 1 is taken when the CU has no absolute abundance data, or these data exist, but fall above its upper threshold of 10,000. Pathway 2 is taken when the CU has absolute abundance data and these fall under its upper benchmark of 10,000. AbsAbd: absolute abundance; AbsLBM: absolute abundance lower threshold (1,000 benchmark plus 500 buffer); AbsUBM: absolute abundance upper threshold; Rel LBM: relative abundance lower threshold; Rel UBM: relative abundance upper threshold, which is the upper benchmark for this metric + 10%; LongTrend: is long term trend metric; %Change: percent change metric. High, Medium, or Low confidence ratings are identified for each node.\n33\n\fPacific Region\nScience Response: Rapid Status Assessments for Pacific Salmon\nFigure 2. Number (lower horizontal axis) or percent (upper horizontal axis) of correct WSP rapid statuses, as compared to WSP integrated statuses, out of the total 65 cases in the learning data set for three fitted algorithms (Minimalist, Fancy Pants and Categorical Realist; and four constructed algorithms: Simply Red, LearningTree1, LearningTree2, LearningTree3). Results are shown for the three alternative WSP status scales (5,3, or 2 status categories), as explained in Table 1. This is one out of several performance measures used; the full set are presented in Table 3. Candidate algorithms were evaluated against criteria with a combination of quantitative and qualitative performance measures, not exclusively based on this figure.\n34\n\fPacific Region\nScience Response: Rapid Status Assessments for Pacific Salmon\nFigure 3. Number (lower horizontal axis) or percent (upper horizontal axis) of close WSP rapid statuses, as compared to WSP integrated statuses, out of the total 65 cases in the learning data set for three fitted algorithms (Minimalist, Fancy Pants and Categorical Realist; and four constructed algorithms: Simply Red, LearningTree1, LearningTree2, LearningTree3. Close indicates the WSP rapid status in only 1 status zone different from the WSP integrated status on a 5 status scale. For example, a CU assessed as Amber by the expert process and assigned Not Red by the Simply Red algorithm would be scored as incorrect in Figure 2, but scored as “close” in this figure. Results are shown for the three alternative WSP status scales (5,3, or 2 status categories), as explained in Table 1. This is one out of several performance measures used; the full set are presented in Table 3. Candidate algorithms were evaluated against criteria with a combination of quantitative and qualitative performance measures, not exclusively based on this figure.\n35\n\fPacific Region\nBowron-ES (SK-Fraser ES)\nScience Response: Rapid Status Assessments for Pacific Salmon\nNarrative: Generational average abundance has generally declined since the 1950s. The WSP rapid statuses switched from Amber to Red in 2004. The relative abundance metric drives the rapid statuses, with statuses matching in all years. Absolute abundance was Amber for most of the time series, except the final year, which was Red. Integrated statuses were Red in 2010 and 2015, matching the rapid statuses. Rapid statuses have subsequently remained Red.\nFigure 4. An example CU summary (Bowron_ES) of rapid statues by individual metrics (RelAbd: relative abundance; AbsAbd: absolute abundance; LongTrend: long-term trend; PercChange: percent change), the WSP rapid status by year, and associated confidence rating (H: High; M: Medium; L: Low). The WSP integrated status (IntStatus) is also indicated for the year this was assessed. The narrative at the top of this figure describes the metrics driving rapid statuses over time. All 62 CUs assessed for rapid status are found in Appendices A–G of Pestal et al. (2023).\n36\n\fPacific Region\nScience Response: Rapid Status Assessments for Pacific Salmon\nFigure 5. WSP rapid status changes over time. A) The number of CUs that were able to be assigned a WSP rapid status increases from 1995 to 2019. The increase over time is due to shorter time series, with data only being available in more recent years for a number of CUs. B) The proportion of Red and Amber CUs, relative to the total number of CU cases (105 total) increased over time. Conversely, the proportion of Green CUs declined. Table 8 lists the annual values.\n37\n\fPacific Region\nScience Response: Rapid Status Assessments for Pacific Salmon\nContributors\nAffiliation Role Contributor DFO Science, Pacific Region Gottfried Pestal Author DFO Science, Pacific Region Bronwyn L.

State of the Salmon: rapid status assessment approach for Pacific salmon under Canada’s Wild Salmon Policy. Can. Tech. Rep. Fish. Aquat. Sci. 3570: xiv + 200 p.\nWe developed an approach to rapidly assess the biological status of Pacific Salmon Conservation Units (CUs) under the Wild Salmon Policy (WSP). This approach assigns a Red (poor), Amber (intermediate), or Green (good) status, with High, Medium, or Low confidence, to CUs with applicable data. Existing integrated WSP status assessment approaches are labour intensive, and therefore, have only been completed for ~11% of the ~377 current Pacific Salmon CUs, and have not been updated since they were assigned in expert workshops. The WSP rapid status approach can provide a more complete and current picture of status across Pacific salmon species in BC & the Yukon. We developed seven candidate WSP rapid status algorithms based on completed WSP integrated status assessments, evaluated algorithm performance against a set of criteria, and identified the best performing algorithm. WSP rapid statuses are incorporated into DFO’s new Pacific Salmon Status Scanner, an interactive data visualization tool for salmon experts. Rapid statuses in DFO’s Salmon Scanner will be combined with expert review to support Fisheries Act Stock Management Unit (SMU) Limit Reference Point (LRP) status requirements, state of salmon reporting, climate change vulnerability assessments, and planning, prioritization and monitoring of hatchery, harvest and habitat actions.\nxi\n\fRÉSUMÉ\nPestal, G., MacDonald, B.L., Grant, S.C.H., and Holt, C.A. 2023. State of the Salmon: rapid status assessment approach for Pacific salmon under Canada’s Wild Salmon Policy. Can. Tech. Rep. Fish. Aquat. Sci. 3570: xiv + 200 p.\nNous avons élaboré une approche visant à évaluer l’état des unités de conservation (UC) de saumons du Pacifique en vertu de la Politique concernant le saumon sauvage (PSS). Dans le cadre de cette approche, on attribue un état rouge (mauvais), ambre (moyen) ou vert (bon), ainsi qu’un degré de confiance élevé, moyen ou faible aux UC selon les données applicables. Les approches intégrées d’évaluation de l’état en vertu de la PSS qui sont utilisées actuellement exigent beaucoup de travail; des évaluations de l’état ont donc seulement été réalisées pour environ 11 % des quelque 377 UC actuelles de saumons du Pacifique et elles n’ont pas été mises à jour depuis leur réalisation dans le cadre d’ateliers d’experts. L’approche rapide d’évaluation de l’état en vertu de la PSS peut fournir une représentation plus complète et à jour de l’état des différentes espèces de saumons du Pacifique présentes dans les eaux de la Colombie-Britannique et du Yukon. Nous avons développé sept choix d’algorithmes pour l’approche rapide d’évaluation de l’état en vertu de la PSS, puis nous avons déterminé l’algorithme le plus performant d’après des évaluations de l’état réalisées selon l’approche intégrée et la performance des algorithmes selon des critères établis. Les états obtenus selon l’approche rapide de la PSS ont été intégrés au nouvel explorateur de l’état des saumons du Pacifique du MPO, un outil de visualisation de données interactif destiné aux experts du saumon. Ces états intégrés dans l’explorateur du MPO seront combinés à un examen effectué par des experts afin d’appuyer les exigences en matière d’état relatives au point de référence limite d’une unité de gestion des stocks en vertu de la Loi sur les pêches, la production de rapports sur l’état du saumon, les évaluations de la vulnérabilité aux changements climatiques, ainsi que la planification et le suivi des mesures prises en matière d’écloserie, de pêche et d’habitat, et l’établissement des priorités connexes.\nxii\n\fACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nWe humbly and respectfully acknowledge that this paper was written on the unceded traditional territories of the xʷməθkʷəy̓ əm (Musqueam), Sḵwx̱ wú7mesh (Squamish), səlilwətaɬ (Tsleil-Waututh) Nations. We recognize that these Nations have been stewards of the land and water for time immemorial, and we honour their deep understanding of the interconnectedness between people and natural systems.\nWe would like to thank all the DFO Staff, First Nations, NGO’s, and consultants that work in the field, labs, and offices to generate salmon escapement, catch and recruitment data. The dedication, attention to detail, and hard work through all environmental conditions to collect these data is a testament to the passion and concern for salmon that so many in British Columbia and the Yukon share. These data are the foundation for all the analyses being done to support salmon resource management, including the status assessments. Algorithms can automate some steps, but without the basic data sets these WSP rapid status assessment approaches could not be conducted.\nWe would also like to thank all those that supported this work through the direct provision of data and many meetings and discussion on how to apply their data to the current project. This includes Joe Tadey, Matt Townsend, Chuck Parken, Antonio Vélez-Espino, Lynda Ritchie, Helen Olynyk, and Tracy Cone.\nFinally we would like to thank all reviewers of this publication. This includes Chuck Parken, Antonio Vélez-Espino, Brendan Connors, Pete Nicklin, biologist for the Upper Fraser Fisheries Conservation Alliance (UFFCA), Kelsey Campbell, biologist for A-Tlegay Fisheries Society, and Ann-Marie Huang (DFO), who have supported many of the more detailed status integration processes, and have been extremely thoughtful and generous with the advice and input they provided towards this work.\nxiii\n\fFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\nWhy did we develop a WSP rapid status assessment approach?\nCanadian Pacific salmon abundances are broadly declining, and this is expected to continue under climate change. To track and manage these changes, it is increasingly important to have up-to-date assessments of the biological statuses for Pacific Salmon Conservation Units (CUs), which represent the fundamental units of salmon biodiversity. Annual CU status information is urgently needed to help adapt our hatchery, harvest, and habitat management approaches to changing salmon production. Existing Wild Salmon Policy (WSP) integrated status assessment processes only get us part-way there. Since they are labour and time intensive, they have only been completed for 11% of the 377 Canadian Pacific Salmon CUs and are 5-10 years out of date. The WSP rapid status assessment approach we developed enables us to assess status annually for BC and Yukon salmon CUs with applicable data.\nWhat is a WSP rapid status assessment?\nWSP rapid status assessments can assign a Red (poor), Amber (intermediate), or Green (good) status, with a Low, Medium, or High confidence rating, to CUs with applicable data. These statuses are generated by a computer-coded WSP rapid status algorithm, which is applied to salmon CU data. A WSP rapid status algorithm is a set of decision rules that approximate the decision-making process that experts used in WSP integrated status assessments. The algorithm assigns a WSP rapid status depending on answers to Yes/No questions for CU status data sets. The combination of metrics applied, and their individual status values compared to metric thresholds, leads to a final WSP rapid status determination.\nHow was the WSP rapid status assessment algorithm selected?\nWe developed a suite of candidate algorithms based on past WSP integrated assessments. We evaluated the performance across multiple candidate WSP rapid status algorithms, by comparing their respective rapid statuses against WSP integrated statuses assigned from past expert-driven processes. The top-performing algorithm was the Learning Tree 3, which we recommend for use in future applications.\nWhat are the three core principles of the Learning Tree 3 WSP rapid status algorithm?\nThe first core principle is that WSP CUs were identified and WSP rapid statuses were developed based on conservation biology principles, and scientific peer-reviewed publications. This ensures that Pacific salmon statuses are scientifically objective, consistent, and comparable across BC/Yukon CUs. Standardized metrics also need to be widely applicable and relatively easy to use and update regularly. The second core principle of WSP rapid status assessment is the vetting of data and evaluation of WSP rapid statuses by experts on specific salmon CUs. The final core principle is continual learning & refinement.\nHow will we use the Learning Tree 3 algorithm?\nThe Learning Tree 3 is central to DFO’s Salmon Scanner. DFO’s Scanner is an interactive data visualization tool specifically designed for experts to support their work on Pacific salmon. This tool enables users to compare status trends across CUs and years throughout BC and the Yukon to support scientific discovery, and decision-making processes. The Scanner will support status evaluations for stock management units against their limit- reference-points (LRP), which is a legal requirement under the modernized Fisheries Act (2019). Other applications could include updates on the state of the salmon, and to support climate change vulnerability assessments. In these decision-making contexts, WSP rapid statuses would be combined with expert input and peer-review.\nxiv\n\f1 INTRODUCTION\n1.1 THE URGENT NEED FOR RAPID WILD SALMON\nPOLICY (WSP) STATUS ASSESSMENTS\nWe present a Wild Salmon Policy (WSP) rapid status assessment approach to annually assess salmon conservation units (CUs) as Red (poor), Amber (intermediate), or Green (good) status, with High, Medium or Low confidence. Regular tracking of the state and distribution of salmon biodiversity is increasingly important in a changing climate. Broad declines in Canadian Pacific salmon abundances have been linked to global climate change and other factors, such as deteriorating habitats, increased fish disease, and invasive species (Grant et al. 2019).\nAlthough adaptive diversity of Pacific salmon occurs at a range of scales that include the species, CU, population and deme, the WSP identifies diversity at the scale of CUs as fundamental units that cannot be recolonized if lost (DFO 2005; Holtby and Ciruna 2007).\nDFO’s WSP applies to five species of Pacific salmon: sockeye (Oncorhynchus nerka), Chinook (O. tshawytscha), coho (O. kisutch), pink (O. gorbuscha) and chum salmon (O. keta). DFO has the authority to manage these species and their habitat under the federal Fisheries Act (2019). The management of steelhead (O. mykiss) and cutthroat trout (O. clarkii) has been delegated to the Province of British Columbia and the Yukon territory, and these species are therefore not included in DFO’s WSP rapid status assessments.\nThe WSP rapid status assessment approach builds on previously completed WSP integrated status assessments (Appendix A; Holt 2009; Holt et al. 2009; DFO 2012, 2015, 2016, 2018; Grant and Pestal 2012; Grant et al. 2020). WSP status assessments are grounded in conservation biology principles, which consider population size and trends as key components in the evaluation of conservation risk (Caughley 1994; Mace et al. 2008). The WSP status assessments also build on International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) status assessment approaches for global species (Rodrigues et al. 2006; Mace et al. 2008; IUCN 2022), which have been adopted by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC’s) for Canadian species (COSEWIC 2010).\nThe detailed WSP integrated assessments are labour intensive, taking 10-40 experts up to three days to complete for each group of CUs. For this reason, assessments have only been completed for ~11% of the 377 current Pacific Salmon CUs, and are currently 5-10 years out of date (Wade et al. 2019). The WSP rapid approach can fill gaps by expanding coverage of CU statuses across time, species, and geographic areas. The WSP rapid status approach ensures statuses are scientifically objective, consistent, and comparable across BC/Yukon CUs. This approach is also relatively easy to implement, applicable to data rich and data poor CUs, and can be updated annually.\nWSP rapid statuses are included in DFO’s Salmon Scanner, which is an interactive data visualization tool. DFO’s Salmon Scanner is specifically designed for experts to support their work and help them contribute to scientific discovery and decision-making processes. It will be used in expert processes to track annual salmon trends, support climate change adaptive science advice to manage hatchery, harvest and habitat actions, and support Fisheries Act limit reference point (LRP) status evaluations for stock management units (DFO 2022).\n1\n\f1.2 STATUS ASSESSMENTS UNDER THE WSP\nRapid status algorithms are part of the next implementation phase of the WSP. Therefore, methods used to generate WSP rapid statuses must fit within the concepts, definitions, and practices established through 20 years of previous work (Table 1; Figures 1 and 2; Appendix A; DFO 2005, 2012, 2015, 2016, 2018; Holt 2009, 2010; Holt et al. 2009; Grant and Pestal 2012; Grant et al. 2020). The WSP rapid status approach must also remain flexible and adaptable to changes in metrics and benchmarks and lessons learned from new WSP integrated status assessments for other species and geographic areas. To set the stage for the WSP rapid status assessment work, this section presents a brief overview of key WSP concepts and terminology. Appendix A provides details that include:\n• additional background on the need for standardized monitoring of Pacific salmon\n(WSP Strategy 1);\n• details on work that has been completed to date to implement WSP Strategy 1;\n• and a comparison of WSP status assessments to those completed by COSEWIC\nunder the Species at Risk Act (SARA).\nA CU status can fall into one of five status zones: Red (poor); Red/Amber; Amber (intermediate), Amber/Green, and Green (good). Red, Amber, and Green statuses were part of the original WSP (Figure 1; WSP 2005), while Red/Amber and Amber/Green were added through subsequent WSP integrated status assessment processes (Table 1; Grant & Pestal 2012; DFO 2015; DFO 2016; Grant et al. 2020), to represent statuses that were intermediary between Red and Amber, and Amber and Green, respectively. There is also a data deficient category (DD), for when a CU does not have sufficient data quantity or quality to assess status, and an undetermined category (UD), when an integrated status cannot be resolved.\nThe basic sequencing of past WSP integrated status assessment processes included:\n\nCompiling CU escapement, recruitment, survival and other data for the group of CUs being assessed (Section 2.2). Spawner enumeration sites are selected, and data gaps are filled as required to assess WSP status.\nSelecting applicable metrics for each CU’s status assessments from a suite of\n\npossible metrics: abundance, trends in abundance, fishing mortality, and distribution- based metrics (Figure 2; Holt et al. 2009; Holt 2009; Holt 2010). Metric applicability depends on the type of data available for the assessed CU, and the quantity and quality of these data. Benchmarks for abundance metrics are estimated if possible.\n\nCalculating statuses for each individual metric. Depending on the metrics used and the CU data available, not all metrics may indicate the same WSP status. For example, there were cases where a CU’s percent change (recent three generation trend) metric might indicate a Red status, while a long-term trend metric might indicate a Green status (Holt et al. 2009; Grant et al. 2011; Grant & Pestal 2012; DFO 2015; DFO 2016; Grant et al. 2020).\nAssessing CU WSP integrated statuses. In this step, experts determine WSP\n\nintegrated statuses by combining individual metric statuses, with other CU information, in a workshop setting (Grant and Pestal 2012; DFO 2015, 2016; Grant et al. 2020). This generates a CU’s consensus designation: WSP status; or DD; or UD. This approach was essential to developing a common rationale for considering information across different metrics in a structured and consistent way.\n2\n\f1.3 CORE PRINCIPLES OF THE WSP RAPID STATUS\nASSESSMENT APPROACH\nThere are three core principles of the WSP rapid status assessment approach:\n\nThe first core principle is that WSP CUs were identified and rapid statuses were developed based on conservation biology principles (Mace and Lande 1991; Mace et al. 1992, 2008; Caughley 1994; National Research Council (US) Committee on Scientific Issues in the Endangered Species Act 1998; McElhany et al. 2000; Rodrigues et al. 2006), and are aligned with scientific peer-reviewed publications (see Appendix A for more details) (Holtby and Ciruna 2007; Holt 2009; Holt et al. 2009; Holt 2010; Grant et al. 2011; Grant and Pestal 2012; DFO 2015, 2016; Brown et al. 2019; Grant et al. 2020). This ensures that Pacific salmon statuses are scientifically objective, consistent, and comparable across BC/Yukon CUs. Standardized metrics also need to be widely applicable and relatively easy to use and update regularly. Specifically:\n\no The WSP identifies diversity at the scale of CUs, as fundamental units that\ncannot be recolonized if lost (DFO 2005). Methods to identify CUs (Holtby and Ciruna 2007), revisions (Grant et al. 2011; Brown et al. 2019), and process to revise CUs (Wade et al. 2019) have been peer reviewed through DFO CSAS (see Appendix A.2).\no The CU WSP integrated status assessments that have been completed were based on ~15 years of development, including CSAS meetings that took up to 3 days and 40 experts to complete (Holt 2009; Holt et al. 2009; Grant et al. 2011; Grant and Pestal 2012; DFO 2015, 2016; Grant et al. 2020). These processes were collaborations across CU experts including DFO staff, Indigenous community members, consultants, NGO’s, etc. (see Appendices A.3 & A.4).\no The WSP status assessment approach builds on the status assessment approach used by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) for global species (Rodrigues et al. 2006; Mace et al. 2008; IUCN 2017), which has been adopted by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC’s) for Canadian species (COSEWIC 2010). A COSEWIC species is roughly equivalent to a WSP CU. The WSP Red status zone largely aligns with COSEWIC’s Endangered status; Amber aligns with Threatened and Special Concern status; and Green aligns with Not at Risk status (See Appendix A.5).\n\nThe second core principle of WSP rapid status assessment is the vetting of data and evaluation of WSP rapid statuses by CU experts. DFO stock assessment leads work in collaboration with Indigenous groups, consultants, and others that support or lead salmon stock assessment programs. These CU experts work iteratively to fine tune the CU data used (determining appropriate escapement sites, years, data treatment, etc.), and select applicable WSP status metrics and metric calculation details, given their knowledge of the data.\nThe final core principle of the WSP rapid status algorithm is continual learning and refinement. This means that data sets and status metrics for each CU will be regularly reviewed and updated, and that the rapid status algorithm will be reviewed through on-going work with CU experts (described in the second core principle). By evaluating WSP rapid status algorithm outputs for the CUs for which they have 3\n\n\fexpertise, CU experts can identify where decision rules may be revised or added to the WSP rapid status algorithm. As new CU cases are added, where common new and/or revised decision-rules are proposed, the revised WSP rapid status algorithm performance can be tested for overall improvements.\n1.4 KEY TERMINOLOGY FOR THE WSP RAPID STATUS\nASSESSMENT APPROACH\nThroughout this report several terms are used with specific definitions.\n• Metrics: quantitative metrics developed for WSP status assessment: relative\nabundance; absolute abundance; long-term trend in abundance; and percent change (short-term trend in abundance)(Section 2.2.2).\n• Benchmarks: specific values identified under the WSP to delineate between Red, Amber, and Green status zones for each metric. For example, 50% is the lower benchmark for the long-term trend metric, that delineates this metric’s Red and Amber status zones (Section 2.2.2). This metric compares the ratio of the current generational average (geometric mean) spawner abundance to the long-term average (geometric mean) to lower (50%) and upper (75%) benchmarks.\n• WSP rapid status algorithms: sets of decision rules that approximate the decision\nmaking process that experts used in WSP integrated status assessments (Section 2.4); see Figure 20 as a candidate algorithm used in the WSP rapid status process.\n• Performance measures: summary statistics used to compare the performance of candidate algorithms (e.g. number of correct WSP rapid statuses across CU cases, compared to WSP integrated ‘true’ statuses for identical data) (Section 2.3).\n1.5 REPORT OUTLINE\nThe objective of this paper is to present a WSP rapid status approach for Pacific Salmon CUs. This is central to DFO’s new Pacific Salmon Status Scanner, which is an interactive data visualization tool designed for experts. Experts include research scientists, Indigenous technical experts, stock assessment biologists, habitat, harvest, and hatchery management biologists etc. This paper provides the following:\n• Methods & Results that include:\nthe learning and retrospective (out-of-samples) data sets used;\no o development of candidate WSP rapid status algorithms; o\nthe performance evaluation of rapid status algorithms, which uses various performance metrics to compare rapid statuses to ‘true’ WSP integrated statuses from previous assessments; criteria are identified to evaluate results; two sensitivity tests: an evaluation of past annual WSP rapid statuses produced for a CU: retrospective (out-of-samples) test; and a comparison of CUs rapid statuses with and without their relative-abundance metric;\no\no capturing confidence in WSP rapid status designations;\n• Discussion: selected algorithm, future considerations, and potential applications.\n4\n\f2 METHODS\n2.1 ANALYSIS OUTLINE\nTo develop a rapid status algorithm that approximates the detailed WSP integrated status assessment approach, we worked through the following 11 steps:\n\nCompiled the learning data set. This includes metric values, corresponding metric\n\nstatuses, and WSP integrated statuses (considered ‘true’ statuses) for CUs from the four past WSP status assessment processes (Grant and Pestal 2012; DFO 2015, 2016; Grant et al. 2020) (Section 2.2).\n\nIdentified six performance criteria to guide the construction, evaluation, and selection\n\nof candidate algorithms. Performance evaluation included quantitative error evaluation, and qualitative considerations (Sections 2.3 & 2.4)\n\nFit Classification and Regression Tree (CART) models to the learning data set: this\n\nincludes metric values or statuses and corresponding WSP integrated statuses (‘true’ statuses) derived from existing WSP integrated status assessments. Trees were fit using various combinations of predictor variables (metric values and statuses on those metrics) and response variable formats (CU status), data subsets, and model fit settings (e.g. complexity penalty; error weighting).\n\nSelected candidate CART algorithms (‘fitted algorithms’) to span the range of trees possible from the available data and settings, from very simple to very complex.\nReviewed narratives provided by experts for their CU WSP integrated status\n\ndesignations, in order to extract common rationale for these designations across CUs: these narratives are reprinted in Appendix B from published (Grant and Pestal 2012; Grant et al. 2020), and unpublished reports (Brown et al. 2014; Parken et al. 2014).\n\nDeveloped custom algorithms (‘constructed algorithms’) by combining CART-derived\n\nalgorithm branches from step 4, with common rationale from WSP integrated status assessments in step 5.\n\nImplemented candidate algorithms as an R function to estimate WSP rapid statuses\n\nusing existing WSP status assessment metrics (learning data set).\n\nEvaluated algorithm performance according to the criteria identified in Step 2.\nConducted retrospective (out-of-samples) tests using the selected algorithm on years\n\nthat do not have WSP status assessment completed.\n\nReviewed results with salmon stock assessment experts.\nPerformed sensitivity tests (with and without using relative abundance metrics).\n\nSteps 3 and 4 above were repeated through an iterative, collaborative process as we explored the effect of alternative CART settings and identified a shortlist of candidate CART algorithms.\nSteps 5-10 above were also repeated through an iterative process. Constructed algorithms were developed and refined through evaluating performance and reviewing documentation from the status workshops to identify missing components and uncover special considerations.\n5\n\f2.2 DATA\n2.2.1 Two Data Sets: Learning vs. Retrospective (Out-of-Samples)\nWe used two data sets for the development and performance evaluations of WSP rapid status algorithms: the learning data set and the retrospective (out-of-samples) data set. The key differences between these data sets are that the learning data set used the exact data and metric values from past WSP integrated status assessments, and the retrospective (out- of-samples) data set used the latest available data and metrics at the time of this publication, for each CU (details below).\n2.2.1.1 Learning Data Set\nThe first phase of algorithm development was to build a learning data set. The purpose of the learning data set was to support the development and evaluation of the candidate algorithms.\nThe learning data set for this analysis consists of WSP metric values, metric statuses, and corresponding WSP integrated statuses from the four completed WSP integrated status assessments (Appendices B & C). This included two assessments for Fraser sockeye (Grant et al. 2011; Grant and Pestal 2012; Grant et al. 2020), one for Interior Fraser coho (Parken et al. 2014; DFO 2015), and one for Southern BC Chinook (Brown et al. 2014; DFO 2016; Brown et al. 2019).\nThe learning data set includes 65 cases for which integrated statuses were assigned by experts in the WSP integrated status assessment workshops: 22 Fraser sockeye CUs from the first status assessment, 23 Fraser sockeye CUs from the reassessment, five Interior Fraser coho CUs, and 15 Southern BC Chinook CUs.\n• There are more cases than CUs, since Fraser sockeye (24 CUs in total) had two WSP integrated status assessments completed and three cases were excluded, totalling 45 cases for this CU group (Table 5). Chilko-ES was excluded for both assessments since it was rolled up into a merged Chilko-S/Chilko-ES CU due to data issues. Spawner estimates for the two CUs could not be separated at the time of assessment. Since Chilko-S contributes the most to the abundance of this pair of CUs, the WSP status will be more representative of this CU, while the Chilko-ES CU is considered data deficient (Grant et al. 2011). The first WSP integrated status assessment of Seton-Late was excluded because its status was assigned undetermined (UD) by experts (Grant & Pestal 2012).\n• There are five cases for five Interior Fraser coho CUs (DFO 2015) (Table 5).\n• There are 15 cases for 15 Southern BC Chinook CUs (Table 5). WSP integrated\nstatus assessments were completed for the wild component of 15 Southern BC Chinook CUs, using data from persistent survey sites classified as low or unknown enhancement (DFO 2016).\n2.2.1.2 Retrospective (Out-of-Samples) Data Set\nA retrospective data set was also built to support the evaluation of candidate algorithms for all applicable years in each CU’s time series. The purpose of the retrospective data set was to produce an out-of-samples data set, where previous WSP integrated status assessments have not been completed. This was done to examine the applicability of the algorithm to new\n6\n\fyears. The retrospective data set also serves as an update to the data used in the status workshops, so that we can evaluate whether status has likely changed for a CU since the WSP integrated assessments were completed 5-10 years ago.\nThis data set used the most up to date data available at the time of this publication. This can include revisions to historical numbers, and changes in approach. Therefore, the metrics calculated for the retrospective data set do not align exactly with those in the learning data set for the same year.\nThe most up-to-date escapement data sets available were obtained for each CU from DFO Stock Assessment experts (Fraser sockeye: T. Cone; Interior Fraser coho: L. Ritchie; Southern BC Chinook: L.A. Vélez-Espino). CU data were prepared using the same methods used in the WSP integrated status processes including spawner abundance site selection, infilling, and, considerations of hatchery abundance proportions (Grant et al. 2011; Grant & Pestal 2012; Grant et al. 2020; Brown et al. 2014; Parken et al. 2014). We then applied the WSPMetrics R package (Pestal and Holt 2020) to calculate the key metrics for the time period 1995-2019, or starting three generations after the first data point for shorter data sets.\nThe retrospective data set covers a total of 42 CUs: 22 Fraser sockeye CUs (combines Chilko-S/ES and excludes Cultus-L), five Interior Fraser coho CUs, and 15 Southern BC Chinook CUs. Differences in the number of CUs covered are due to reviews or reconsiderations of the available data and, for Chinook, updated classifications of hatchery abundance proportions for component sites. Specifically, for each of these groups we provide the differences between the retrospective time series compared to the learning data set, where these occur:\nFraser Sockeye: There were no changes in the CU list or data treatment for 23 out of the 24 CUs between the retrospective and the learning data set. Note that similar to the learning data set, Chilko-ES/S were combined in the retrospective data set, dropping the total CUs from 24 to 23. Data for 2016-2019 were added to the retrospective data set using consistent data treatment methods (Grant et al. 2020). Cultus-L was excluded from the retrospective data set due to high hatchery contributions, and, therefore, it is not considered ‘wild’ according to the WSP (DFO 2005).\nSalmon are considered ‘wild’ if they have spent their entire life cycle in the wild and originate from parents that were also produced by natural spawners that continuously lived in the wild’ (DFO 2005). In the WSP integrated status assessments (Grant et al. 2011; Grant & Pestal 2012; Grant et al. 2020), adipose-fin clipped adults were removed from the escapement time series, since they represent hatchery origin fish. A significant proportion of returning adults, however, came from parents that themselves were hatchery origin, therefore, these fish would not be considered ‘wild’ according to the WSP. Since considerations of how to consider hatchery origin fish in this time series are outstanding at the time of this publication, we excluded this CU in the retrospective data set. This contrasts with the learning data set where Cultus-L was included because it was assessed in past WSP integrated status assessments.\nInterior Fraser Coho: There were no changes in the CU list and data treatment between the retrospective and learning data set. Specifically, there were 5 cases for Interior Fraser coho (DFO 2015) included both data sets.\nSouthern BC Chinook: There were no changes in the CU list, and some data treatment changes between the retrospective and learning data set, based on an unpublished data report (Brown et al. 2014) a more recent published report (Brown et al. 2019), and updates provided by DFO Area staff in the summer of 2023. There were 15 cases for Southern BC Chinook in the retrospective data set, with some differences from the learning data set. These\n7\n\fdifferences are due to the more recent reclassification of some Southern BC Chinook sites, and a review of site-specific classifications of enhancement level (Brown et al. 2020). As a result, four of the original 15 CUs can no longer be assessed: a) because the data were determined to be too poor for calculating metrics; and b) because there are now no wild sites. However, four additional CUs can be assessed, two because survey sites were re-classified from high or moderate to low enhancement (Lower Shuswap River in the Shuswap River_SU_0.3 CU, CK-15, Marble and Cayeghle in the West Vancouver Island-North_FA_0.x CU, CK-33) , one because data quality was reassessed (Lower Fraser River_SP_1.3, CK- 04), and one because new data was provided by area staff for a CU that was previously data deficient (Okanagan_1.x, CK-01). The retrospective data set, therefore, covers 15 CUs of Southern BC Chinook.\n2.2.1.3 Annual Updates\nThe data processing procedures and R code we developed to create the retrospective data set also set the stage for annual updates and expansion to additional CUs. This includes code and other inputs developed to clean, infill and merge CU data, and calculate the annual metrics. This process also generates required input files for DFO’s Salmon Scanner, which allows users to interactively analyze statuses over time, as well as across species and areas (Section 4.5). These data processing procedures and R code will be used to update these time series annually, and may evolve as required by data analysts.\n2.2.2 Overview of the WSP Rapid Status Metrics and Benchmarks\nThe WSP emphasizes ‘standardized monitoring of [Pacific] salmon status’ (DFO 2005; Holt et al. 2009). A standard suite of metrics is foundational to assessing ‘wildlife species’ status (Rodrigues et al. 2006). Standardized status metrics have been established globally through the IUCN (Mace et al. 2008; IUCN 2022) and adopted in Canada by COSEWIC (COSEWIC 2010). Wildlife species assessed by the IUCN include plants, animals and fungi; and species assessed by COSEWIC include native mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish, arthropods, mollusks, vascular plants, mosses and lichens. Standardized metrics enable the objective and transparent assessment of status, and the production of consistent status results. A COSEWIC ‘species’ largely aligns with WSP CUs. Standardized metrics enable comparisons of status across assessed species and CUs. Standardized metrics also need to be widely applicable and relatively easy to use and update regularly (Mace and Lande 1991).\nThe WSP status assessment approach was built on the status assessment methods developed by the IUCN and COSEWIC (DFO 2005; Holt et al. 2009). The WSP status approach currently includes metrics for a CU’s abundance and trends in abundance, described in subsequent sections (Appendix A; Holt et al. 2009; Holt 2009; Grant et al. 2011; Grant & Pestal 2012; DFO 2015; DFO 2016; Grant et al. 2020). Status criteria are based on conservation biology principles, which emphasizes two paradigms: small population size and declining population to assess conservation risk (Caughley 1994; Mace et al. 2008).\nOther related information on salmon CUs such as spawner fecundity, size-at-age, total productivity or survival at different life-stages has been considered in WSP integrated status assessments, directly through the data sets used, or in final status narratives.\nWhile there is a considerable amount of other ancillary information such as information on salmon disease, parasite prevalence, genetic diversity, etc. that could be included to assess salmon status, we do not recommend using these sources of information for the WSP rapid status approach. Instead we recommend continuing to emphasize standardized metrics and 8\n\fadditional information that focuses on abundance and trends in abundance. It would also be challenging to implement these in a standardized way across CUs to assess WSP status due to their limited availability across CUs, and gaps in determining thresholds to distinguish between poor, intermediate and good statuses for this information. Where this type of ancillary information would be particularly important, however, is to help understand threats faced by a salmon CU, and, therefore, support rebuilding considerations.\nThe following four metrics were applied in WSP status assessment processes conducted to date: relative abundance, absolute abundance, long-term trend and percent change. The learning data set and the retrospective (out-of-samples) data set include all four of these metrics, where available for a CU. We also discuss distribution metrics and ancillary information used specifically in past WSP integrated status assessments, and rationale for exclusion in the WSP rapid status approach. Specifics on these metrics are provided below:\nRelative abundance\nThis metric compares a CU’s most recent generational average spawner abundance to benchmarks estimated with a) stock-recruitment models (Holt et al. 2009; Grant et al. 2011; Grant and Pestal 2012), b) freshwater habitat capacity models (Parken et al. 2006; Grant et al. 2011; Grant and Pestal 2012; DFO 2015, 2016; Grant et al. 2020), or c) percentiles of the spawner abundance time series (Holt et al. 2018). These benchmarks are unique to each CU. Across all estimation approaches, the relative abundance metric is applied only when CU experts both confirm its applicability to the existing CU data, and provide a benchmark they consider appropriate.\nStock-recruitment-based benchmarks are recommended for CU’s with applicable stock- recruitment data. Using this method, the lower benchmark is Sgen, the escapement that would result in recovery to Smsy in one generation, and the upper benchmark is 80% Smsy, which is the spawner abundance at maximum sustainable yield (Holt 2009, 2010; Holt et al. 2009). When used for southern BC Chinook CUs, the upper benchmark differed slightly (85% Smsy) to align with those used in the Pacific Salmon Treaty (PST) process.\nFor CUs where stock-recruitment data are not available, habitat-capacity-derived benchmarks have been used for the relative-abundance metric. For lake-rearing sockeye CUs, habitat capacity based on the rearing lakes used by a CU’s juvenile stages in freshwater have been used. The lake(s) photosynthetic rate (PR) and juvenile sockeye competitors (Grant et al. 2011) are used to estimate Smax, which are spawners at maximum juvenile production. The recommended lower and upper benchmarks are respectively, 20% and 40% of Smax (Holt 2009; Grant et al. 2011). For a number of Chinook CUs, freshwater habitat capacity has been used to develop relative-abundance-metric lower (Sgen) and upper benchmarks (85% Smsy) (Parken et al. 2006).\nPercentile benchmarks have been recommended for data limited CUs. However, they have been shown to be appropriate only in cases where CU productivity is moderate to high (&gt;2.5 recruits-per-spawner) and harvest rates are moderate to low (≤ 40%) (Holt et al. 2018). They have not yet been used in WSP integrated status assessment processes, and since these were not provided by any CU experts for this current WSP rapid status assessment process, they are not included here.\nAbsolute abundance\nThis metric compares the average escapement of the most recent generation (geometric mean) to COSEWIC criterion D1 and part of criterion C, which are used to define ‘Threatened Species’ (COSEWIC 2020). The lower benchmark is set at 1,000, to align with criterion D1,\n9\n\fand the upper benchmark is set at 10,000, which is used in combination with other abundance metrics under criterion C (COSEWIC 2020).\nThese benchmarks are grounded in fundamental principles of population and conservation ecology. The value 1,000 is a critical threshold identified in conservation biology (National Research Council (US) Committee on Scientific Issues in the Endangered Species Act 1998; McElhany et al. 2000). Below 1,000, a population is more at risk from demographic stochasticity, such as randomly in a given year producing mostly males or females. They also are at greater risk from environmental change and catastrophic events, accumulating deleterious genetic mutations, and have a low evolutionary potential to adapt to environmental change.\nThe value 10,000 is an upper limit on population size conservation risk from environmental variation and catastrophic events; sizes above 10,000 individuals protect populations from moderate to high environmental variation as one example (National Research Council (US) Committee on Scientific Issues in the Endangered Species Act 1998; McElhany et al. 2000). Currently, deteriorating environmental conditions are increasingly occurring in salmon habitats due to climate change, with more extreme events like flooding, drought, fires, and heatwaves (Bush and Lemmen 2019; Cheung et al. 2021; IPCC 2022a; Cheng et al. 2023). These events can also occur concurrently, compounding their impacts on wildlife species.\nFor these reasons, the IUCN, and COSEWIC also include a small population size criteria to account for this increased extinction risk within their status assessment process (COSEWIC 2010; IUCN 2022). Wildlife species assessed by these organizations may be perpetually classified in Threatened or Endangered categories. Conservation science shows that higher extinction risk exists for such small populations regardless of whether they have remained stable at low abundances for several generations. This 1,000 benchmark was used by experts in the past WSP integrated status assessments, in combination with other metrics and additional information, to determine CU status documented in the narratives for Fraser sockeye, Southern BC Chinook and Interior Fraser coho (see Appendix B for narratives reprinted from CSAS publications).\nLong-term trend in abundance\nThis metric compares the ratio of the current generational average (geometric mean) spawner abundance to the long-term average (geometric mean) to lower (50%) and upper (75%) benchmarks.\nPercent change (short-term trend in abundance)\nThis metric compares the linear change in total spawner abundance (or effective female spawners for Fraser sockeye CUs) over the most recent three generations to lower (-25%) and upper (-15%) benchmarks.\nDistribution Metrics\nAn additional class of metrics summarizing spawner distribution was included in the WSP status assessment toolkit (Holt et al. 2009), but was not included in the WSP rapid status assessment approach. Further, no benchmarks have been resolved for distribution metrics through expert processes or research.\nDistribution metrics were only applied in WSP integrated status assessments for Southern BC Chinook and Interior Fraser coho, and they did not consistently influence statuses where they were considered (DFO 2015, 2016). For other species like Fraser sockeye, they were not considered applicable. This was due to the relatively small spatial distribution of spawners\n10\n\fwithin a CU relative to other species (Grant et al. 2011), with sockeye CUs generally being defined based on rearing lake and timing. Further, common sockeye assessment methods such as using fences, mark recaptures, or sonar, do not provide readily available data on spawning distribution to assess this. These stock assessment methods provide single escapement estimates for an entire system, rather than spawning locations within the CU.\nDetermining if salmon abundance data are a suitable proxy for changing spawner distributions should be investigated for WSP status assessments. Distribution metrics might be particularly important to broadly distributed CUs, like those of chum and pink salmon. If work is done to develop benchmarks and explore their use by experts in WSP integrated status assessment processes, this metric could be added to the WSP rapid status approach. However, another important consideration is how broadly available these data will be across CUs, and how readily they can be updated annually.\nInformation on changes within a CU’s spawning or juvenile rearing distribution should be captured when developing recovery or rebuilding plans. Considerable information on spawning distribution exists among salmon experts within DFO and among Indigenous communities and other groups. This might be more relevant at this subsequent step, rather than in the evaluation of status, where abundance and abundance trends could potentially be used as a proxy for changes in distribution over time.\nAncillary Information used in past WSP integrated status assessment processes\nAdditional information that supported WSP integrated status assessments but was excluded from the WSP rapid assessments included: time series plots of CU escapements, recruitment, productivity, marine and/or freshwater survival, individual population escapements within a CU, exploitation rates, and hatchery information wherever relevant and available. It also included additional context for the metrics themselves, such as retrospective metric values, and uncertainty in the metrics, or, in the case of the relative abundance metric, uncertainty in the benchmark estimates (Sgen and Smsy). This information was included alongside the WSP metrics in CU data summaries, which were used in each of the WSP integrated status assessment processes. However, since the interpretation and use of this information varied by CU, as well as among expert groups in the workshop setting, it could not be used to inform the WSP rapid status approach.\n2.2.3 WSP Rapid Status Metric Calculations\nAll four metrics (relative abundance, absolute abundance, long-term trend, and percent change) incorporate an estimate of the generational average of spawner abundance in their calculation. These calculations differed among groups of CUs. The generational average is calculated as the geometric mean across the number of years corresponding to the most common age class (e.g., four years for most Fraser sockeye). For Fraser sockeye CUs, spawner time series were smoothed prior to calculating generational averages, whereas for Interior Fraser coho and Southern BC Chinook generational averages were calculated using unsmoothed time series, in part because of high proportions of missing data that made generational smoothing unreliable (SBC Chinook).\n2.2.4 WSP Rapid Status Metrics and Metric Values Applied\nEach of the four metrics cannot be applied to every CU. The two most broadly applicable metrics are the long-term trend and percent change, since they can be applied to both types\n11\n\fof escapement data available for Pacific salmon that include: absolute abundance or indices of abundance (i.e. relative index). Use of these metrics, however, requires a sufficient recent time series, with limited gaps. In contrast, relative and absolute abundance metrics are less broadly applicable across CUs. They require absolute abundance data, which is available for a smaller proportion of CUs.\nMetric availability by CU was handled differently in the learning data set, which focused on the information used for past WSP integrated status assessments, and the retrospective data set, which captures our current understanding of best available information.\n2.2.4.1 Learning Data Set Metrics\nThe learning data set included the exact metric values that were used in the past WSP integrated status assessments (Pestal & Grant 2012; DFO 2015; DFO 2016; Grant et al. 2020). This means that we did not re-calculate metric values with updated data sets and/or recalculate CU-specific benchmarks for the relative abundance metric. Published WSP metric values and statuses, and the resulting WSP integrated statuses from the past four integrated WSP integrated status assessment processes are listed in Appendix C, filtered according to the conditions listed below. We also removed cases from the learning data set where the WSP integrated status is DD or UD; this results in a total of 65 cases of combined metrics and WSP statuses. Note that the majority of cases in the learning data set are Fraser sockeye CUs (45/65 = 69%), because those WSP status assessments covered a lot of CUs, and it is the only CU group where a second status assessment was completed (Grant et al. 2020).\nRelative abundance metric benchmarks included in the learning data set include stock- recruitment model benchmarks, used for most Fraser sockeye and Interior Fraser coho CUs, and one Southern BC Chinook CU (Lower Fraser River_FA_0.3); see benchmark nuances for cyclic and non-cyclic Fraser sockeye CU in subsequent paragraphs. This also included lake-carrying-capacity benchmarks for one Fraser sockeye CU (Chilliwack-ES).\nAlthough habitat-capacity approaches were used to estimate relative abundance metric benchmarks for a number of Southern BC Chinook CUs in past WSP integrated status assessments (Parken et al. 2006), these were not used by experts to determine CU status. Therefore, these benchmarks were excluded from the learning data set because the participating experts considered them not applicable as calculated at the time. This was because most of the Chinook spawner time series used to compare recent abundances to the benchmarks represented index systems only (not the total CU), while benchmarks were calculated based on the freshwater capacity of entire CUs.\nMetric values used in the completed WSP integrated status assessments had to be transformed for the algorithm inputs. This is because algorithm fitting requires that a single value and status be identified for each of the four metrics used to assess WSP rapid statuses:\n• Trend metrics: The long-term trend metric values were originally expressed as a ratio (e.g.1.28 if the current generation average is 128% of the long-term average) and the percent change metric (previously called the short-term trend metric) values were originally expressed as a percent (e.g. -40 for a 40% decline). For consistency in the WSP rapid status assessment approach, both were expressed as percent values; however, the underlying changes over time are the same as in the past WSP integrated status assessments.\n12\n\f• Non-Cyclic Fraser Sockeye CUs; capturing uncertainty in biological benchmark\nestimates: This is specific to non-cyclic Fraser sockeye CUs. Uncertainty in relative abundance metric benchmarks was incorporated into data summaries in two ways to support the WSP integrated status assessments (Grant and Pestal 2012; Grant et al. 2020): a) Relative abundance benchmarks and associated metric statuses were presented across a range of probability levels (10% to 90%) to incorporate assessment uncertainty in the benchmark estimates; b) benchmarks, and associated relative abundance statuses, were also shown using multiple stock-recruitment models for each CU, where appropriate.\nTo streamline the WSP rapid status approach, we chose one value for each upper and lower benchmark per CU. We used the 50% probability level estimates of the Ricker model-derived benchmarks for non-cyclic Fraser sockeye CUs, as these benchmarks held the most weight in the completed Fraser sockeye WSP status assessments. Fraser sockeye cyclic CUs are described in a subsequent bullet. Note that assessment uncertainty in relative abundance benchmark estimates was also presented in the Southern BC Chinook and Interior Fraser coho WSP integrated status assessments; however, relative abundance metric statuses were not explicitly presented across benchmark probability levels for these assessments. Future work could test the sensitivity of WSP rapid statuses to alternative probability levels for the benchmark values in the relative abundance metric.\n• Highly cyclic Fraser Sockeye CUs: In the current assessment, five of the 24 Fraser\nsockeye CUs are considered cyclic: Takla-Trembleur-EStu; Shuswap-ES; Quesnel-S; Takla-Trembleur-Stuart-S; Shuswap-L. Cyclic CUs exhibit persistent abundance patterns that include one large and three smaller abundance years over a four year period, which represents a cycle period of predominantly four year old Fraser sockeye. The larger abundance year is referred to as the ‘dominant’ cycle year, and the smaller abundance years are referred to as ‘off-cycle’ years. These highly cyclic Fraser sockeye CUs presented unique considerations in the integrated status assessments (Grant et al. 2011; Grant & Pestal 2012; Grant et al. 2020). We calculated metrics for these cyclic Fraser sockeye CU cases as follows:\no Relative abundance metric: Data summaries used in the first WSP Fraser sockeye integrated status assessment did not present relative abundance metrics for cyclic Fraser sockeye CUs (Grant & Pestal 2012). In the second WSP Fraser sockeye integrated status assessment, Larkin model-derived relative abundance benchmarks were produced for each of the four cycle-lines of each cyclic CU, across a range of probability levels (Grant et al. 2020). Abundances from each recent cycle line year were compared to corresponding cycle-line benchmarks to determine statuses for each of the four cycles on this metric. We used the ‘dominant’ cycle spawner abundance and the 50% probability level benchmark in the learning data set. This was the rationale provided by experts to designate WSP integrated statuses by experts in the second integrated status assessment (Appendix B; Grant et al. 2020).\no Absolute abundance metric: Generally, during the WSP integrated status assessment workshops, the experts considered the distribution of recent abundances (annual values) against the relative and absolute abundance benchmarks when determining status. The more years that fell below the lower benchmarks on these metrics, the more likely the CU was Red, though experts were less likely to downgrade statuses for cyclic CUs than non-cyclic CUs,\n13\n\fparticularly when the recent dominant cycle abundance was relatively high. We used the most recent generation geometric average to compare against the absolute abundance benchmarks (1,000 and 10,000) in the learning data set. This was identical to the approach used for non-cyclic Fraser sockeye CUs.\n• Wild vs. Enhanced: In the Southern BC Chinook WSP integrated status assessment (DFO 2016), experts completed three status assessments for each case. They evaluated the CU (i.e. fish from wild spawning sites), the enhanced unit (EU; fish from sites with moderate or high enhancement), and the total unit (TU; all sites). We include only the metrics and associated status for the CU (wild) to ensure consistency across species.\n2.2.4.2 Retrospective (Out-of-Samples) Data Set Metrics\nFor the retrospective (out-of-samples) data sets, we included the same suite of metrics for each Fraser sockeye and Interior Fraser coho CU that was used in the WSP integrated status assessments. A CU’s relative abundance metric benchmark stayed the same throughout the retrospective (out-of-samples) data set.\nSpecifically, for Fraser sockeye CUs, we used the benchmark estimates from the 2017 re- assessment (Grant et al. 2020), not the benchmark estimates from the first assessment in 2012 (Grant & Pestal 2012). This included Ricker model derived benchmarks for non-cyclic CUs, and Larkin model derived benchmarks for cyclic CUs on the dominant cycle line.\nFor Southern BC Chinook, however, more recent work was used to identify the appropriate metrics for the retrospective (out-of-samples) data set, the results of which deviate from those used in the WSP status assessments, and learning data set, for some CUs (Brown et al. 2020). We used the metric usability categorizations from Table 5 in Brown et al. 2020, and the most recent site classifications, to define which CUs and metrics to include in the retrospective data set. The classification of enhancement level was also updated for some sites in some CUs since the WSP integrated status assessments.\n• Data treatment for the three WCVI CUs was revised for consistency with a recent case study reviewed by CSAS (Holt et al. 2023b) and further revised based on guidance from CU experts. Specifically, the set of indicator sites used to build the CU- level time series was revised based on new information (PNI, Proportionate Natural Influence, Withler et al. 2018) on hatchery contribution. This PNI-based revision to CU-level time series is potentially applicable to many other SBC Chinook CUs that are currently data deficient due to the enhancement rating for indicator sites, and could greatly expand coverage of the WSP rapid status scan (e.g., Inner South Coast).\n• New data were provided by BC Interior staff for Okanagan Chinook, using estimates\nof natural-origin spawners developed by the Okanagan Nation Alliance.\nFor the retrospective analysis, and for future case studies, we standardized the metric calculations. The WSPMetrics R package (Pestal and Holt 2020) implements the same approach used in the learning data set, producing a single value for each metric as inputs to the algorithms.\n14\n\f2.3 PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF WSP RAPID STATUS\nALGORITHMS\n2.3.1 General Approach\nTo evaluate the performance of candidate algorithms, we first established agreed-upon criteria to identify which aspects of model performance to prioritize. These criteria determined which performance measures and data to use, how to weight performance measure results, and what other criteria to consider when evaluating algorithms.\nPerformance criteria were used to both define and evaluate algorithms:\n\nThey were first used for pre-screening algorithm variations that were explored in the\n\ndevelopment step, leading to a shortlist of candidate algorithms.\n\nThen they were used for a detailed performance evaluation of the candidate\n\nalgorithms.\nDepending on the criterion, the algorithm performance evaluation was either qualitative or quantitative. Quantitative evaluations were done by using the learning data set to compare predicted values (in this case: WSP rapid statuses) to observed values (in this case: WSP integrated statuses from expert consensus) and quantify the magnitude and direction of errors.\nWe next performed two sensitivity tests to (1) evaluate the stability of the algorithm statuses over time (retrospective (out-of-samples) test), and (2) test how the inclusion or exclusion of the relative abundance metric affects WSP rapid statuses produced by the different algorithms. Status is intended to trend over time without large annual variations. The first sensitivity analysis evaluates the extent to which this holds for the candidate algorithms, using the retrospective data set. The second sensitivity analysis evaluates the extent to which the accuracy of candidate algorithms depends on the availability of the relative abundance metric, which typically is only available for data-rich CUs. For this test we excluded the relative abundance metric from the learning data set and evaluated algorithm performance.\nThe rest of this section documents the criteria, performance measures, and qualitative considerations, including sensitivity tests, we used.\n2.3.2 Criteria for Selecting WSP Rapid Status Algorithms\nThe criteria we used to guide the construction, evaluation, and selection of candidate algorithms are as follows:\n\nAlgorithms should have relatively low error rates when comparing WSP rapid statuses\n\nto integrated statuses, the latter which are assumed to be ‘true’ statuses.\n\nAlgorithm errors should be precautionary, meaning that estimated rapid statuses\n\nshould err on the side of being poorer, indicating a higher risk of extirpation, when compared to ‘true’ integrated WSP statuses. For example, if a ‘true’ integrated WSP status is Amber, a rapid status error should be more likely to be Red over Green.\n\nAlgorithms must be broadly applicable across CUs with different data types and metric\n\navailability.\n15\n\f4. Algorithms that estimate WSP rapid status for three main status zones: Red, Amber,\nand Green are preferred.\n\nAlgorithms should reflect thresholds that emerged from those distinguishing statuses in WSP integrated status assessment. These tend to be equal to or more biologically conservative than WSP benchmarks for individual metrics from Holt et al. (2009).\nAlgorithm decisions should adhere to the logic applied in the WSP integrated status assessments. This includes following common rationale applied in the detailed WSP status assessment processes, as documented in the CU status narratives reprinted in Appendix B, which includes extracts from Grant and Pestal (2012), Grant et al. (2020), Brown et al. (2014) and Parken et al. (2014).\n\nPerformance of the algorithms on criteria 1, 2, and 3 can be quantified using error rates, measures of bias (specifically over-prediction), and completion rates, respectively. Completion rate is the proportion of the 65 cases in the learning data set for which WSP rapid status could be assigned. These quantitative performance measures were calculated across all CUs and by species.\nPerformance on criterion 4 can be easily evaluated by checking that all three simple WSP integrated status zones (Red, Amber, and Green) are included as branches of the algorithm trees.\nPerformance on the remaining criteria, 5 and 6, is subjective and was evaluated by expert opinion.\nWe iteratively evaluated and altered candidate algorithms based on their performance against these criteria. For some algorithms, this was done by adjusting the CART tree fit settings. For other algorithms we actively revised or reorganized the decision nodes. Section 2.4 describes the details.\n2.3.3 Quantitative Performance Measures\nFor the 65 cases in the learning data set (Section 2.2), we compared WSP rapid statuses generated by each of the candidate algorithms to the existing WSP integrated statuses (considered ‘true’ statuses).\nWe used the entire learning data set to evaluate performance of candidate algorithms using the six criteria above. Due to the small sample size, we did not use cross-validation approaches that split these data into learning and testing data sets, as is commonly done for forecasting models (see review in MacDonald and Grant 2012). Cross-validation is generally recommended to minimize the risk of over-tuning models to the idiosyncrasies of the data being used; this is intended to minimize overly optimistic expectations for how models will perform with new data sets (Picard and Cook 1984). However, the learning data set had a relatively small sample size, making cross-validation inappropriate (Picard and Cook 1984).\nInstead, to prevent overfitting the candidate algorithms to CUs and years in the learning data set, and to ensure the algorithms were broadly applicable to all BC and Yukon CUs, we applied the following methods:\n• We developed performance criteria (Section 2.3.2) to guide the construction, evaluation and selection of candidate algorithms. If we had relied exclusively on model performance determined through cross-validation, this would have increased the risk of selecting an algorithm that is ‘overfitted’ to the learning data set.\n16\n\f• Algorithm development included both fitted and constructed algorithms:\no Three fitted algorithms were based on CART analyses (Section 2.4.2), which\nuses cross-validation to determine error rates and types. Using CART analyses, algorithm fit is determined by balancing error rates and types, and tree complexity. Different fitted algorithms were developed by altering both the complexity setting from low to high, and altering the use of metric values or statuses. CART analysis was conducted using the R package rpart (Therneau and Atkinson 2019).\no Four constructed algorithms (Section 2.4.3) were developed using the CART algorithms as a baseline. These constructed algorithms were built to more closely align with the algorithm criteria in Section 2.3.2. and incorporate common rationale extracted from existing WSP integrated status assessments. Considering common rationale that would be applicable to a broad range of CU data types reduced the risk of overfitting algorithms to the learning data set.\n• We conducted a retrospective (out-of-sample) test with the seven candidate\nalgorithms for years that do not have WSP integrated status assessments completed. Another companion report conducts an out-of-sample test for CUs not previously assessed (Pestal et al. 2023). Experts verified status results in these cases to confirm the applicability of the algorithm(s) to these new assessed years.\nTo calculate prediction errors we first converted statuses to scores from 1 = Green to 5 = Red (Table 4). We then calculated the difference between WSP integrated status scores and the WSP rapid status scores (i.e. observed-predicted). A negative error means that the algorithm predicted a poorer status than the WSP integrated status. Note that candidate algorithms differed in terms of possible outcomes (e.g. whether Red/Amber and Amber/Green options are included), and the status scores were adapted accordingly. Section 2.4.4 describes the status scales (Table 4) and how they were used.\nWe used the following quantitative performance measures to compare algorithm performance for all cases:\n• Number and percent correct: the total number of cases and the percent of cases\nwhere the WSP rapid status matches the WSP integrated status (‘true’ status). This measures alignment with Criterion 1. Note that percent correct is calculated from the number of completed cases (see below), not the total number of cases (e.g. if an algorithm can assess 40 of the 65 cases, and 30 WSP rapid statuses match the WSP integrated statuses, then the percent correct is 30/40 = 75%, not 30/65 = 46%).\n• Number and percent over-predicted: the total number and percentage of cases with positive errors in status estimates, where the WSP rapid status assigned by the algorithm is better than the WSP integrated status. This measures alignment with Criterion 2. Percent over-predicted is calculated from the number of completed cases.\n• Number and percent completed: the number and percent of cases where the\nalgorithm was able to generate WSP rapid statuses. This partially measures alignment with Criterion 3 to the extent that different data types and metric availability are represented in the learning data set.\n• Median, Mean, and Range of Prediction Errors: summary statistics that describe the\ndistribution of prediction errors and identify any bias.\n17\n\fIn addition, we cross-tabulated WSP integrated statuses against the WSP rapid statuses predicted by an algorithm. The frequency of each type of possible error resulting from misclassification was estimated. For example, a CU with a Green WSP integrated status that is misclassified by the algorithm as Amber will have the same error of +2 as an Amber CU misclassified as Red, but the biological implications of the error are different. We present the details for each error type to explore these differences. The practical implications of observed errors were evaluated qualitatively through discussions with species experts (C. Parken and A. Vélez-Espino, DFO, pers. Comm).\n2.3.4 Sensitivity Test 1: Retrospective (Out-of-Sample) Test\nFor the retrospective (out-of-samples) test, we applied all candidate algorithms to the data and metrics for each year in the retrospective data set, which does not include any ‘true’ WSP integrated statuses. Therefore, the retrospective (out-of-samples) test can only evaluate status changes over time.\nWe looked at whether the WSP rapid statuses for a CU were stable or gradually changed over time (desired properties), or bounced between status zones frequently between years, possibly due to assessment errors. Status is intended to focus on the overall signal in the data and not vary inter-annually in response to noise.\nWe also compared the time series of annual WSP rapid statuses between algorithms to look for similarities and differences in these patterns. For example, several algorithms may identify a worsening status for the same year, even if they assign different statuses, resulting in similar patterns.\nThe out-of-sample test also serves as a practical test of how the selected algorithm can be used going forward, with annual status updates and decision-support tools focusing on status changes over time.\n2.3.5 Sensitivity Test 2: Excluding Relative Abundance Metrics\nThe relative abundance metric is not available for all CUs (see Section 2.2). In fact, most Pacific salmon CUs likely will not have this metric. Therefore, for CUs in the learning data set with relative abundance metrics, we tested the influence of including or excluding this metric on the WSP rapid statuses generated relative to the ‘true’ WSP integrated statuses.\nThere were 37, out of 65 cases in the learning data set, that have values for the relative abundance metric. We compared the inclusion or exclusion of these values for the relative abundance metric for these cases, on the WSP rapid statuses, compared to ‘true’ WSP integrated statuses.\n18\n\f2.4 DEVELOPING A SHORTLIST OF CANDIDATE\nALGORITHMS\n2.4.1 Overview\nWe developed two types of algorithms (Appendix D):\n• Fitted: based on Classification and Regression Tree (CART) analyses;\n• Constructed: candidate CART trees adapted based on common rationales extracted\nfrom existing WSP integrated status assessments.\nWe explored algorithms that predict WSP rapid statuses based on either the metric values (e.g. percent change shows a decline steeper than -25%) or the metric statuses (e.g. percent change is Red). Similarly, we explored algorithms that predict all five WSP integrated status zones: Red, Red/Amber, Amber, Amber/Green, and Green; just the three simplified status zones: Red, Amber, and Green; or two simplified zones: Red, and Not Red. These align with, respectively, the 5 status scale, the 3 status scale and 2 status scale for error calculations described below (Table 4; Section 2.4.4).\n2.4.2 Fitted Algorithms using CART Analysis\nClassification and Regression Tree (CART) analyses are widely used in decision analysis and machine learning to identify complex patterns in data and develop algorithms for classification of new cases (Ripley 1996). The approach is very versatile but comes with highly specialized terminology (Table 2).\nBriefly, CART searches for a binary split in available data or cases, which uses a criterion to divide the original group of cases into two smaller groups of cases. Tree branches are added as these new groups are further split into even smaller groups. In technical terminology, the approach uses machine learning methods to build a dichotomous key to the data.\nWhat determines the ‘best’ grouping of cases depends on error rates (i.e. number of incorrect classifications), error type (e.g. false positives vs. false negatives in a classification tree that screens for a medical condition), and tree complexity (i.e. the number of branches on the tree). In CART, the fitting step balances the number of branches (complexity) against the magnitude and type of misclassifications.\nThe strength of binary trees comes from recursive partitioning. At each node, a single criterion is used to split the cases into two more homogeneous subsamples. That means that a binary tree can pick up conditional interactions between variables in a very straight-forward way. As an illustration, consider a field guide for species identification. Once the data on species traits have been worked through several of the steps and the options are narrowed down to two possible species, then a single easily identifiable traits can tell them apart. However, that same characteristic would not yield a proper classification if it were applied to the entire sample of possible cases.\nWe used the R package rpart (Therneau and Atkinson 2019) to fit classification trees to our learning data set of 65 completed WSP status assessments, using the metrics as predictor variables and WSP integrated statuses as the response variables. Rpart uses cross- validation to estimate error between predictor and response variables. We explored many\n19\n\falternative fitted trees working through variations of response variables, predictor variables, model fits, and data subsetting (Table 3).\nFrom the many variations of fitted algorithms that we explored, we selected a shortlist of candidate algorithms. Shortlisted CART algorithms were chosen to bookend the range of complexity possible through this analysis, including one very simple algorithm (Minimalist) and one very complex (Fancy Pants) (Table 6). This pre-screening step used the criteria, quantitative performance measures, and qualitative considerations documented in Sections 2.3.2 and 2.3.3, which are then used again to evaluate the performance of the shortlisted algorithms.\nWe identified three candidate fitted algorithms for detailed performance evaluation (Table 6):\nMinimalist\nThe Minimalist algorithm (Appendix D.1) was created by setting the complexity penalty high and working with the simplified status categories (Red, Amber, Green). It is the simplest model fit using the CART analysis (Table 6). The intent with this algorithm is to have the greatest applicability to the broadest range of CUs. This algorithm uses only trend-based metrics (long-term trend and percent change), as these metrics are the most likely to be available across the range of Pacific salmon CUs in the Pacific Region.\nThe Minimalist algorithm relies on metric values, not metric statuses, as predictor variables. Therefore, the splitting thresholds are extracted by the CART fit from the expert assessments, and do not simply carry over the official metric benchmarks.\nFancy Pants\nThe Fancy Pants algorithm (Appendix D.2) was created by setting the complexity penalty low and working with the full range of status categories (including Red/Amber and Amber/Green). Fancy Pants is the most complex algorithm fit by the CART analysis (Table 6). This algorithm uses all of the available metrics and is the only algorithm that can assign statuses to all five status zones: Red, Red/Amber, Amber, Amber/Green and Green.\nCategorical Realist\nThe Categorical Realist algorithm (Appendix D.3) was included as a candidate algorithm to specifically incorporate absolute abundance vs. relative index data types into the CART analysis binary splits. The Categorical Realist algorithm was developed specifically to address algorithm Criterion 3 and 5 (Table 6). Therefore, this algorithm uses metric statuses, instead of values, to separate tree branches, since metric statuses are determined using the WSP benchmarks (Holt 2009). We incorporated an initial step that separates the data based on data type: absolute abundance, or relative index. Trees were fit individually to each data type, then combined into one tree. The drawback of this algorithm is that it only assigns Amber and Red statuses, there is no branch for the Green status zone (Criterion 4). This is a result of how the fitted tree splits the sample and assigns a designation to each subset. In this particular case none of the four endpoints (‘leafs’) has a majority of samples with Green status. However, it is extremely simple, relying on only two metrics once the initial data type screening is complete.\n2.4.3 Constructed Algorithms\nUsing the CART-fitted algorithms as a baseline, we built four constructed algorithms to more closely align with the six performance criteria identified in Section 2.3.2. One algorithm is relatively simple, aptly named Simply Red; and three are more complex, named Learning\n20\n\fTree 1, 2 and 3 (Table 6; Appendix D). The more complex Learning Tree algorithm represents an evolution of improvements over each subsequent version, representing the adaptive nature of this algorithm. This algorithm illustrates the approach we are proposing for future implementation, as new WSP integrated status assessments are completed for more CUs and Areas, which may require further improvements to the WSP rapid status algorithm.\nSimply Red\nThe Simply Red algorithm (Appendix D.4) was designed to specifically address Criterion 2. This criterion calls for algorithms to produce WSP rapid statuses that are more biologically conservative (i.e. err on the side of poorer status) than WSP integrated statuses (Table 6). To do this, we mined CART-fitted models to identify nodes where Red statuses were assigned, and combined these into one tree that includes all criteria used to flag Red CUs. The algorithm uses metric values identified in the Minimalist and Fancy Pants fitted algorithms to identify binary splits. However, these values have been adjusted to align with WSP benchmarks and COSEWIC criteria, where appropriate (Criterion 5).\nSince the objective with this algorithm is to identify Red CUs, it assigns only two statuses: Red, and Not Red (Criterion 4). The algorithm does not assign the Amber and Green status zones, therefore, its applicability for WSP rapid status assessments is limited to scanning for poor status CUs.\nThe Learning Tree family of algorithms\nFor the Learning Tree family of algorithms (Appendices D.5, D.6 and D.7; Table 6), our objective was to follow all of the criteria as closely as possible, though we placed the greatest emphasis on two qualitative criteria:\n•\nimproving algorithm applicability to populations with different metric availability (Criterion 5), and\n• algorithm adherence to the logic applied in the WSP status integration processes\n(Criterion 6).\nThis was to ensure that the algorithm can be applied to CUs outside of those included in the learning data set. The intention behind this series of algorithms is that they will continuously improve as more WSP integrated statuses across more CUs become available.\nFirst, we examined documentation of the completed WSP integrated status assessments in published peer-reviewed reports (Grant and Pestal 2012; Grant et al. 2020), and unpublished reports (Brown et al. 2014; Parken et al. 2014) (See Appendix B). We considered both the WSP integrated statuses and the narratives that experts developed when they assigned CU status (see Appendix B). Using this information, we extracted common rationale, either identified explicitly for the group of CUs being assessed, or indirectly through repeated mention across CUs. From these common rationales we identified those that were most broadly used across all species, and those that pertained to specific data types and situations.\nNext, we reviewed the CART-fitted trees for common decisions made in these analyses, and compared these to the common rationale from the WSP integrated status assessments. From this, we identified essential tree elements to include in the constructed algorithm from the existing branches of the fitted trees. We then incorporated important WSP integrated status assessment considerations that were missing from the CART-fitted trees where we could. Constructing this algorithm by hand allowed us to include conditional rules within tree branches that can better capture the nuances of the decision-making processes of the WSP\n21\n\fintegrated status assessments.\nDevelopment of the Learning Tree algorithms was highly iterative. As each branch evolved, this algorithm was evaluated for biological rationale and consistency with the WSP integrated status assessments, and error rates (Section 2.4.4) were investigated. Where there were differences between algorithm-generated WSP rapid statuses and the WSP integrated statuses, we had a deeper look at the documented rationale behind the WSP integrated status to identify missing components, and/or alternative metric breakpoints, as described below. These considerations were iteratively added to the algorithm where possible, hence the Learning Tree has three alternative versions so far (Learning Tree 1, 2 and 3) (Appendix D.5, D.6 and D.7). Learning Tree 3 is the most recent iteration of this algorithm (Appendix D.7).\nThe initial Learning Tree development used components of the Minimalist, Fancy Pants, and Categorical Realist algorithms, guided by common rationales used to assign status from past WSP integrated status assessments. Common rationales details are provided in Appendix B, and summarized below:\n• Where relative abundance metrics are available, these highly influence a CU’s status,\nindependent of other metrics in many cases.\n• Where absolute abundance data exist, absolute abundance metrics should be\nscanned against COSEWIC criterion D1 on small population sizes (&gt;1,000 fish). This step is not included in any of the fitted algorithms. In adding this step, we applied a precautionary buffer to the COSEWIC threshold for small populations (1,000 fish), setting the threshold at 1,500 in the Learning Tree 3. This was to account for how this metric was treated by experts in the workshops, where CU statuses may be downgraded if one year in a generation fell below 1,000, if the estimates were considered uncertain, or if the generational average was close to the 1,000 threshold.\n• Similar to the precautionary buffer on the lower benchmark of the absolute abundance metrics (previous bullet), we also added a 10% buffer to the upper threshold for the relative abundance metric. The standard WSP metric uses 80% of Smsy as the upper benchmark for relative abundance, but the Learning Tree algorithms treat abundances that are only a little bit above the benchmark as a flag for Amber status.\n• Long term trends and percent change are most heavily relied upon only in the absence of other metrics, and where COSEWIC criterion D1 is nottriggered\nUsing these WSP common rationale as the base for tree structure, we pulled nodes from the existing CART-fitted trees to build two versions of the Learning Tree.\nLearning Tree 1 was initially constructed using metric value thresholds from the Minimalist and Fancy Pants algorithms, or values based on the WSP benchmarks. Some thresholds were then adjusted to better align with patterns in the data and ensure that they are precautionary (Criterion 2). For example, the percent change threshold (i.e. short-term trend over 3 generations) was changed from -80% in the Minimalist to -70% in the Learning Tree algorithms. With this change, a less steep decline is needed to trigger the criterion.\nLearning Tree 2 uses metric statuses inferred from the threshold values extracted from the CART analyses, or from the WSP assessments. Learning Tree 2 was produced to ensure that Criterion 5 was being met, and metric thresholds are biologically justifiable.\nThe resulting Learning Tree algorithms are applicable across data types and metric availability (Criterion 3). In contrast to the other candidate algorithms, Learning Tree 1 and 2 use all available metrics: they use both the relative abundance and absolute abundance\n22\n\fmetrics where applicable, but also provide status pathways for CUs where these metrics cannot be calculated.\nLearning Tree 3 evolved from Learning Trees 1 and 2 after reviewing results for Southern BC Chinook and Interior Fraser coho with experts on these species and their WSP integrated status assessments. Learning Tree 3 includes the following considerations to improve results for Interior Fraser coho in particular; however, these additions are likely to be widely applicable across all Pacific salmon CUs:\n• CUs are scanned against the population size threshold used as part of COSEWIC Criterion C, where available. This corresponds to the upper benchmark used in the absolute abundance metric. If abundance falls below this threshold (10,000 fish), the only status options are Red and Amber, because COSEWIC would be more likely to assign a Threatened status when this criterion is met (Section 2.2.2).\n• The order of branches was changed to check whether the WSP rapid statuses were sensitive to changes in the sequence of decision nodes and was then settled to complete COSEWIC scans prior to other steps. Specifically, the first step in Learning Tree 3 is to check whether absolute abundance data are available, and if so, whether they fall close to or below the COSEWIC thresholds for small populations.\n• The consideration of long-term trend and percent change (i.e. recent short-term trend) was fine tuned in Learning Tree 3. That part of the tree applies to cases where relative abundance metric is not available. Specifically:\no The node identified by steep recent decline (percent change &lt; -70%) was\nchanged from Amber in Learning Tree 1 to Red in Learning Tree 3 to be consistent with COSEWIC criterion A, which states “An observed, estimated, inferred or suspected reduction in total number of mature individuals over the last 10 years or 3 generations, whichever is the longer, where the causes of the reduction are: clearly reversible and understood and ceased, based on (and specifying) any of the following: For endangered -70%, for Threatened - 50%. If the causes of decline are NOT known and reversible, this % is -50% for endangered and -30% for threatened.” So any CU that has -70% decline will be Red by COSEWIC regardless of abundance, and Learning Tree 3 was adapted to be consistent with that criterion.\no After this change, that part of Learning Tree 3 needed another step to split out Green vs. Amber, so the corresponding criterion from the fitted Minimalist algorithm was included as the final step.\n2.4.4 Error Calculations on Alternative Status Scales\nFor the completed status assessments in the learning data set, we compared WSP integrated statuses to the WSP rapid statuses to assess status classification error. To do this we converted all statuses to numeric scores (Table 4). WSP integrated statuses were originally designated for five status zones (Red, Red/Amber, Amber, Amber/Green and Green). These were converted to scores on three different status scales to match the status scales used by different WSP rapid status algorithms. WSP rapid status algorithm statuses were also converted to scores from 1 to 5 on their respective status scales (Table 4 and Table 6).\nThe 5 status scale directly aligned to the five status zones of the WSP integrated status assessments. WSP integrated statuses converted to a 5 point scale includes: Green = 1; Amber/Green=2; Amber=3; Red/Amber=4 and Red=5. This scale is most appropriate for the 23\n\fFancy Pants algorithm, which also provides status for all 5 status zones (Table 6). If Fancy Pants assigns a Red status (score 5) on its 5 point scale, and the WSP integrated status is Amber status (score 3) on its 5 point scale, then the error is 2. However, other algorithms were also compared to the 5 point WSP integrated status scale using their scores on the scale that aligns with their results (Table 4). For example, if the WSP integrated status was Amber/Green (score = 2) and the Simply Red status was Red (score = 5 on the 2 status scale), then the error is 2-5 = -3.\nThe 3 status scale was applicable to WSP rapid status algorithms that assign only simplified statuses (Red=5, Amber=3, Green=1) and do not include mixed status zones (Red/Amber and Amber/Green) (Table 4). To convert the mixed integrated statuses to simplified status zones we used only the lower zone from the mixed status. For example, a CU with an WSP integrated status of Red/Amber became Red on the 3 status scale (Table 4). This was necessary to accurately represent error across algorithms, without over-estimating the error rate of those algorithms that produce WSP rapid status using only the Red, Amber, and Green status zones. It weights the algorithms towards being more biologically conservative in their assignment of statuses. This status scale was aligned with the Minimalist and Learning Tree 1,2 and 3 algorithms. The Categorical Realist also aligns with the 3 status scale, except that it only produces Red or Amber statuses, not Green. Again, other algorithms were also compared using the 3 point scale to evaluate performance.\nThe 2 status scale was applicable to the Simply Red algorithm that assigns only Red=5 or Not Red=2 statuses (Table 4). For this scale we converted the WSP integrated status of Red or Red/Amber into a Red status, and all other statuses (Amber, Amber/Green, or Green) into Not Red. This was done for similar rationale as the 3 status scale. Specifically to accurately represent error across algorithms without over-estimating the error rate for the algorithm that was designed using only the Red and Not Red status zones. Although this status scale was aligned to the Simply Red algorithm, other algorithm results were also compared to this 2- point scale.\nIt is most appropriate to review an algorithm’s performance by comparing the algorithm status and the WSP integrated status on identical status scales.\n• 5 status scale: Fancy Pants\n• 3 status scale: Minimalist, Categorical Realist (although this only produces Red and\nAmber statuses), Learning Trees 1 to 3;\n• 2 status scale: Simply Red\nIf a mis-matched status scale is used to assess error for an algorithm, it is not entirely an apples-to-apples comparison. For example, if a case’s WSP integrated status is converted from Amber (score: 3) on the original 5 status scale, to Not Red (score: 2) on the 2 status scale, then algorithms with 3 status scales scores (either Green=1; Amber=3; or Red=5) will never align to the 2 status scale score of Not Red=2.\nWe evaluated performance of each algorithm on all three status scales, in order to allow comparisons across algorithms, but highlight for each algorithm the scale that is most appropriate for evaluating performance of that algorithm on its own.\nEach status scale is informative for a different purpose. The 5 status scale captures all the nuances of the integrated status assessments from the expert workshops, but can only be compared to the WSP rapid statuses from the Fancy Pants algorithm. The 3 status scale matches the outputs for most of the other candidate algorithms, but a direct comparison to integrated statuses on a 5 status scale would distort the error calculations (i.e. an Amber\n24\n\fdesignation produced by Learning Tree 3 for a CU with integrated status Amber/Green is not wrong, rather it is correct at a coarser level of resolution). The 2 status scale is the only one that gives an accurate picture of how the Simply Red algorithm performs, but it can also be used to compare all the candidate algorithms on the same scale. Finally, which status scale is the most useful depends on the question being asked. If the intent is to track patterns in status on a fine scale, then the 5 status or 3 status scales are more useful. If, however, the intent is to identify the number of Red CUs, then algorithm performance on the 2 status scale is highly informative.\n2.5 CAPTURING CONFIDENCE IN WSP RAPID STATUS\nDESIGNATIONS\nConfidence in the WSP rapid status designations can be increased through careful screening of the data and metrics being used (i.e. quality control of inputs). Once the inputs have been vetted, confidence in the status designations can be quantified.\nRobustness of fitted trees based on CART models can be evaluated by comparing alternative algorithms, but in our analysis we are already identifying the single best performing algorithm based on the set of criteria presented earlier.\nDuring the WSP integrated status assessment processes, confidence in status assessments increased when there was convergence in statuses across individual metrics (i.e., cases where the absolute abundance, relative abundance, percent change and long-term trends all indicated the same status). However, it is not clear how agreement across metrics could be considered consistently when there are mixed signals across metrics, due to the many possible variations.\nWe therefore capture confidence in the WSP rapid status results based on the type of information used to assign status, which has two components:\n\nData screening and metric applicability (Section 2.5.1) and;\nAssigning confidence based on algorithm node using the branches of the\n\nrecommended algorithm, which is based on the type of data available and the sequence of criteria used to assign the status (Section 2.5.2).\n2.5.1 Data Screening and Metric Applicability\nTo develop the learning data set used in the WSP rapid status approach, we used the data, specifications and metrics identified in past WSP integrated assessment processes (Grant et al. 2011, 2020; Grant and Pestal 2012; DFO 2015, 2016). These processes relied on years of work selecting and treating the data, and identifying relevant metrics, benchmarks, and specifications (such as average generation length) required to assess WSP status. Processes also relied on workshops and CSAS peer review to finalize data, metrics, metric interpretation, and status assignments.\nThrough these past processes, DFO Area stock assessment staff compiled the data sets used in this WSP rapid status assessment work. This data set was developed through their understanding of DFO field survey and escapement estimation approaches, and also through collaborations and engagement with external projects led by First Nations, consultants, etc. Through their local expertise on particular CUs, and their engagement with external local experts, data applicable for use in WSP status assessments is identified.\n25\n\fPoor quality data are not included in the data sets used for WSP status assessments as part of the data processing step. Area staff are involved in determining which data are included in the CU data sets, and which years require infilling for metric calculations. This step includes collaborative work with externals who are leading or collaborating on relevant stock assessment projects.\nDFO Area staff are also involved in selecting which metrics can and cannot be calculated from the data sets they provide. This step pre-screens all poor-quality data out of the process and ensures that the data are appropriate for the metrics being calculated. For example, absolute abundance metrics are only calculated where absolute abundance data are present or otherwise deemed appropriate. As a further screen, apart from absolute abundance, each metric either requires that the time-series provided be of a certain length in order to calculate the metric (e.g. need 3 generations of data to calculate percent change) or requires benchmarks provided by Area staff, which generally require adequate stock-recruit data.\n2.5.2 Assigning Confidence Based on Algorithm Node\nGreater confidence in status is associated with particular metrics and status results. In the WSP integrated status assessments, assigned statuses were more consistent across experts for some cases than others. In particular, cases that had absolute and relative abundance metrics were more consistently assessed than those with only trend metrics and relative index data (Figure 3 and Figure 4). To apply these metrics, a CU must have higher quality data to be able to estimate benchmarks, or estimate this metric’s annual value for comparison with its benchmarks. Therefore, we have more confidence in statuses that are assigned using the absolute and relative abundance metrics, than statuses assigned using long-term trend metrics.\nThe long-term trend metric compares a CU’s metric value (ratio of the current generational average spawner abundance to the long-term average) to the metric’s benchmarks. The CU’s value for this metric is influenced by the length of the time series and degree of fisheries exploitation that occurred early in the time series. This metric can also be calculated for lower quality data, including indices of abundances. For these reasons, this metric was considered less reliable to assess status by experts in past WSP integrated status assessment processes.\nTo account for these differences in confidence identified from past WSP integrated status assessment processes, we used the branches of the algorithm itself to identify confidence in the statuses being assigned, based on the combination of metrics, metric values, and data types that determine each status node. Through expert judgement we can bin the end nodes into three confidence zones: High, Medium, or Low, and then evaluate this binning by referring to the learning data set CUs that end up in each zone.\nConfidence ratings below were applied to each end node of the Learning Tree 3 algorithm as follows (Figure 20):\n• High confidence - Red: either absolute abundance is available and falls below 1.5\ntimes the lower benchmark on this metric (node 3), OR relative abundance benchmarks are available and generational average spawner abundance falls below the lower benchmark (nodes 19 or 23).\n• High confidence – Green: abundance is above the upper benchmark on the absolute abundance metric, or this cannot be assessed AND relative abundance benchmarks\n26\n\fare available and generational average spawner abundance falls above 1.1 times the upper benchmark (node 36).\n• High confidence – Amber: abundance is above the upper benchmark on the absolute abundance metric, or this cannot be assessed; relative abundance benchmarks are available and generational average spawner abundance fall between the lower and 1.1 times the upper benchmarks (node 37).\n• Medium confidence – Red: (1) absolute abundance falls between the upper and 1.5\ntimes the lower benchmarks and status is based on long-term trend (node 21); or, (2) abundance is above the upper benchmark on the absolute abundance metric, or cannot be assessed, relative abundance metrics are not available but status can be assessed based on long-term trends alone (nodes 17) or with both long-term trend and percent change (node 33).\n• Medium confidence – Amber: either (1) have relative abundance benchmark and\nabsolute abundance is between the upper and 1.5 time the lower benchmark (node 22), (2) relative abundance metrics are not available, but absolute abundance is between the upper benchmark and 1.5 times the lower benchmark, and based on long-term trend (node 20)\n• Low confidence - Amber: abundance falls above the upper benchmark on the\nabsolute abundance metric, or cannot be evaluated on this metric, and relative abundance metrics are not available so CU status is assessed based on long-term trend and percent change (node 65).\n• Low confidence – Green: abundance falls above the upper benchmark on the\nabsolute abundance metric, or cannot be evaluated on this metric; relative abundance metrics are not available; status is based on trends alone (long-term trend and percent change) (node 64).\n2.6 IMPLEMENTATION OF CANDIDATE ALGORITHMS\nComputational implementation of the candidate algorithms required substantial programming. When fitting CART models with the {rpart} package in R, the resulting tree object is fully integrated with the generic R functions for working with fitted models. For example, the output includes error summaries like the confusion matrix and surrogate splits for handling missing data (Table 2). The fitted tree can also be applied easily to new data with the R function predict(). This is extremely efficient when dealing with large data sets and many alternative complex trees, because it automates the full sequence from testing alternative fitting criteria to evaluating predictions.\nHowever, in our particular decision setting we are dealing with a small data set of cases where a broader planning process needs to be able to understand the rationale for each classification (i.e. fully transparent). The surrogate splits were creating challenges during our review of candidate algorithms, and there is no simple option for turning off surrogate splits in the R function, rpart().\nIn addition, there is no simple way for generating tree objects for constructed algorithms in a way that mimics the output from rpart() so that it can be fed into predict(). We therefore built a custom function, rapid_status(), which applies the fundamental logic of the trees generated by rpart(), such as the node numbering system described in Table 2, but with hardwired classification steps for each candidate algorithm and customized outputs specifically for our\n27\n\fdata structure (e.g. error calculations).\nThe rapid_status() function is available as source code and in an R package in a github repository available upon request (sue.grant@dfo-mpo.gc.ca).The code required a lot of trial and error to identify and handle special combinations of metrics values and missing data, so we recommend that any future applications work with the latest version of the function available through this repository, rather than trying to implement themselves the steps in the decision tree diagrams in Appendix D.\n3 RESULTS\n3.1 PERFORMANCE WITH LEARNING DATA SET\nDespite differences among the algorithms and across CUs in terms of available metrics, all algorithms were able to complete WSP rapid status assessments for most of the cases, with number complete ranging from 54/65 (83%) to 65/65 (100%) of the cases in the learning data set (Table 7). Most algorithms were also able to achieve a high number of correct WSP rapid status assignments on their associated status scales (see grey highlighted cells in Table 7; Figure 8). Comparisons of WSP rapid statuses generated by each algorithm compared to the WSP integrated statuses are presented for Fraser sockeye (Figures 5 & 6); Southern BC Chinook and Interior Fraser coho (Figure 7).\nWe focused on the total number of correct cases for comparing algorithms (Table 7; Figure 8), because this performance measure captures both the completion rate and whether the completed assignments are correct. For example, Learning Tree 3 could assign statuses for all 65 cases, and 54 of the assignments were correct (since all cases were completed, this represents 83% of the total 65 cases). By comparison, Fancy Pants completed only 54 cases, but 47 of those were correct (72% of all 65 cases; 87% of completed 54 cases). Depending on which percentage you look at, Fancy Pants performed either much better than Learning Tree 3, or a little bit worse. By focusing on the total number correct, we avoid potential confusion with these alternative percentages.\nPatterns in completion rates were similar across species for each algorithm (Table 8 to 10). All Learning Tree algorithms had 100% completion rates across species using the full learning data set. The Minimalist also had close to 100% completion rate across species. Other algorithm completion rates varied across species. The Categorical Realist completion rate was lower for Fraser sockeye in particular (78%), but was 100% for Chinook and coho. Simply Red and Fancy Pants had a lower completion rate for both sockeye and Chinook, but 100% completion for coho.\nMost errors across algorithms (&gt;60%) were within one gradation on the 5 status scale away from the WSP integrated status (Figure 9). This was categorized as ‘close’ in Table 7 to 10 (Figure 9).\nMore detail on errors can be found in Table 13; and Figure 10 to Figure 16. These show the distribution of errors for each algorithm. This provides additional information about the direction and magnitude of the classification errors summarized in Tables 7 to 10.\nAppendix E summarizes the performance for each algorithm. Appendix F provides detailed error diagnostics; this includes confusion matrices, which cross-tabulate WSP integrated statuses vs. rapid statuses assigned by the algorithm, for all cases in the learning data set.\n28\n\f3.2 RECOMMENDED ALGORITHM: LEARNING TREE 3\nWe assessed candidate algorithms qualitatively and quantitatively according to the criteria outlined in Section 2.3.2. No algorithm excels on all six criteria. However, Learning Tree 3 outperforms the other algorithms on the most criteria overall, due to its broad applicability, high accuracy, biologically conservative metric thresholds, and consistency with the common rationale used by experts in the WSP integrated status assessments.\nLearning Tree 3 outperformed all the other algorithms on both number completed and number correct. The Learning Tree 3 algorithm assigned a WSP rapid status to all 65 cases (100% completed) and has the highest overall number of correct completed assignment (54 cases, 83%; on the 3-status scale) (Table 7).\n3.2.1 Criterion 1: Low Error Rate\nCriterion1: Algorithms should have relatively low error rates when comparing WSP rapid statuses to integrated statuses, the latter which are assumed to be ‘true’ statuses.\nLearning Tree 3 performed best when each algorithm is compared to the most appropriate status scale (5, 3, or 2 status levels), achieving 54 correct on the 3 status scale out of 65 cases (grey shaded cells in Table 7). Learning Tree 3 also achieved the highest number of ‘close’ status assignments on all three status scales (within 1 step on the error scores in Table 4). The 2 status scale is most appropriate to evaluate performance of Simply Red. However, even on this scale, Learning Tree 3 has the greatest number correct (Table 7). On the 5 status scale Fancy Pants has the greatest number correct (47), higher than the Learning Tree 3 (44), though its completion rate is lower (54/65; 83%) than the Learning Tree 3 (65/65; 100%) (Table 7).\nOverall, Learning Tree 3 assigns almost as many CUs correctly as Fancy Pants even on the 5-point scale that Learning Tree 3 was not designed for (44 vs 47). Fancy Pants assigns some of the mixed status CUs correctly but fails to classify many of the other CUs with less data.\nThe Learning Tree 3 algorithm had the greatest number correct for sockeye (Table 8) and Chinook (Table 9), whereas for coho the Minimalist, Fancy Pants and Categorical Realist algorithms (Table 10) had the most correct cases. Though even for coho, Learning Tree 3 still had a high number of correct cases (4 out of 5).\nLearning Tree performance improved from version 1 to version 3, in number completed and also number correct (Table 7). This supports our decision to combine information from the fitted trees with information from common rationale generated in the expert workshops. It also highlights the importance of continuous review and tweaking of the Learning Tree algorithm as additional case studies are completed.\n3.2.2 Criterion 2: Precautionary\nCriterion 2: Algorithm errors should be precautionary, meaning that estimated rapid statuses should err on the side of being poorer, indicating a higher risk of extirpation, when compared to ‘true’ integrated WSP statuses. For example, if a ‘true’ integrated WSP status is Amber, a status error should be more likely to be Red over Green.\nAlgorithms differed substantially in terms of the total number of over-predicted cases, but for 29\n\fthis criterion the completion rate needs to be considered as well (Table 7). For example, Learning Tree 3 assigned better status than the expert consensus for 7 out of 65 completed cases (11%). Fancy Pants, on the other hand, only over-predicted 1 out of 54 completed cases (2%), which is a much better performance on this single criterion. However, Learning Tree 3 assigned more cases correctly (Criterion 1) than Fancy Pants (54 vs. 49 on the 3 status scale) and completed more cases (Criterion 3).\n3.2.3 Criterion 3: Broadly Applicable\nCriterion 3: Algorithms must be broadly applicable across CUs with different data types and metric availability.\nThe number of completed cases for the entire learning data set varied from 54 to 65 out of 65. The Learning Tree algorithms have the highest completion rate, each assigning statuses to 100% of the learning data set (Table 7).\nCompletion rate differed by species (Table 8 to 10) because data types and metric availability differ by species. Chinook CUs are much more limited in metric availability than coho and most sockeye CUs. Most (14 out of 15) Chinook CUs are missing both the relative abundance and absolute abundance metrics, while only four sockeye CUs are missing both of these metrics, and 11 sockeye CUs are missing the relative abundance metric only.\nFor Fraser sockeye, the three Learning Tree algorithms performed the best, with all 45 cases completed, and Categorical Realist performed the worst, with only 35 cases completed (Table 8). Most of the algorithms completed all 15 cases for Southern BC Chinook (Table 9), apart from Fancy Pants and Simply Red (11 cases completed each).\nAll algorithms completed all 5 cases for Interior Fraser coho (Table 10).\n3.2.4 Criterion 4: Three Status Zones\nCriterion 4: Algorithms that estimate WSP rapid status for three main status zones, Red, Amber, and Green are preferred.\nFour of the seven algorithms assign status on the 3 status scale: Minimalist, and Learning Tree 1-3.\nWhile Fancy Pants assigns status on the 5 status scale, the resulting status could be simplified to the 3 status scale (i.e. by converting any Red/Amber to Red, and any Amber/Green to Amber).\nCategorical Realist and Simply Red, however, assign only two status zones and do not meet this criterion. This was intentional for Simply Red, which was specifically designed to assign either Red or Not Red. It was a result of the CART fitting for the Categorical Realist, which only has branches assigning either Amber or Red. For both algorithms this characteristic restricts the ability to capture the full range of status required by WSP rapid status applications.\n30\n\f3.2.5 Criterion 5: Status Thresholds Consistent With Published WSP\nAssessments\nCriterion 5: Algorithms should reflect thresholds that emerged as those distinguishing statuses in WSP integrated status assessment. These tend to be equal to or more biologically conservative than WSP benchmarks for individual metrics from Holt et al. (2009).\nThe CART-fitted algorithms, and the Simply Red constructed algorithm, which was assembled from parts of the fitted algorithms, use fitted thresholds to distinguish tree branches (e.g. for the long-term trend metric). The Learning Tree algorithms combine these fitted thresholds with a review of the CU status narratives, to ensure that the thresholds are consistent with WSP intent.\nThe only algorithms that apply WSP benchmarks directly are the Categorical Realist and the Learning Tree 2, which use metric statuses instead of values to determine WSP rapid status. However, in Learning Trees 1 and 3 metric thresholds derived from the Minimalist and Fancy Pants algorithms were adjusted to better align with the WSP benchmarks, and also to better fit the data, and align with the common rationale used by experts to assign status during the WSP integrated status assessments. As mentioned, metric thresholds in Learning Tree 1 and Learning Tree 3 are generally more biologically conservative than the WSP benchmarks, with the exception of one tree branch (Section 2.4.3).\n3.2.6 Criterion 6: Rationale Consistent With Published WSP\nAssessments\nCriterion 6: Algorithm decisions should adhere to the logic applied in the WSP integrated status assessments. This includes following common rationale applied in the detailed WSP status assessment processes, as documented in the CU status narratives reprinted in Appendix B, which includes extracts from Grant and Pestal 2012, Grant et al. 2020, Brown et al. (2014) and Parken et al. (2014).\nOnly the Learning Tree algorithms were developed with explicit consideration of the overall and CU-specific common rationales used by experts to assign WSP integrated statuses (Appendix B). Basically, the Learning Tree algorithms incorporate both status considerations revealed in the 65 completed assessments as well as the stated broader rationale in the workshop consensus. The fitted trees only draw on the quantitative metrics and status designations. The Learning Tree algorithms have also been carefully vetted by experts for logical flow.\n3.3 CONFIDENCE RATINGS FOR LEARNING TREE 3\nSTATUS RESULTS\nWSP rapid statuses assigned by Learning Tree 3 were categorized as High, Medium, or Low for most of the 65 cases in the learning data set (Table 12). These confidence ratings were compared to the errors between the WSP rapid statuses and the WSP integrated statuses. Given the high overall success rate of this algorithm, there were only a few errors where WSP rapid statuses and integrated statuses did not align. Specifically, there were five cases where the algorithm assigned a better status than the WSP integrated status, and did so with High confidence (Table 12). These are the outcomes we would want to minimize, since they are less precautionary.\n31\n\fIn all five cases, the discrepancy between WSP rapid and integrated statuses was small, and can be readily explained by the additional information considered in the expert deliberations, as documented in the status narratives for each CU within the WSP assessment reports (Appendix B). In all these cases, Learning Tree 3 generates WSP rapid statuses that match the starting point for the experts’ integrated status discussions, but the algorithm cannot capture the nuances of additional information used in the workshop consensus to downgrade the statuses by half a category (i.e. from Amber to Red/Amber or from Green to Amber/Green). On the 3-status scale, these half-category statuses were then simplified to the lower status (i.e. Red/Amber became Red, Amber/Green became Amber), and therefore these show up as a full category error in the comparison.\nDetails for the five cases are:\nFrancois-Fraser sockeye (2010): Experts in the WSP integrated status assessment process classified this CU as Red/Amber, which is converted to Red on the 3 status scale to calculate error. Learning Tree 3 assigns a WSP rapid status of Amber due to the relative abundance metric, where the recent generational average is between lower and upper benchmarks. So in part, this discrepancy comes from converting the WSP integrated Red/Amber status to Red on the 3 status scale to calculate error. In the WSP integrated status assessments, experts used recent abundance and the long-term trend metric to move towards Amber, but then downgraded status based on additional information: low productivity (R/S) and sensitivity of the relative abundance metric (i.e. Red on some probability levels of the lower benchmark Sgen estimates for the time-varying productivity model).\nFrancois-Fraser sockeye (2015): Experts in the WSP integrated status assessment process classified this CU as Amber/Green. Learning Tree 3 assigns a WSP rapid status of Green because the recent generational average was more than 10% above the upper relative abundance benchmark (i.e. RelAbd &gt; 1.1*UBM). However, in the WSP integrated status assessments assessment the experts considered the full Bayesian posterior distributions for a suite of alternative benchmark estimates, as well as the retrospective pattern, both of which showed a mixture of Red and Amber metric statuses, and therefore the expert consensus was an Amber/Green designation. The algorithm uses a simplification of this, based on the median of a single benchmark estimate.\nShuswap-Late sockeye (2015): The expert workshop classified this CU as Amber/Green. Learning Tree 3 assigns a WSP rapid status of Green because generational average was more than 10% above the upper relative abundance benchmark (i.e. RelAbd &gt; 1.1*UBM). Experts in the status workshop used additional information to downgrade the status: (1) low abundance, (2) declining trends on off-cycle years, (3) percent change and long-term trend were given less weight in the expert workshop due to higher uncertainty in off-cycle estimates (last years in the time series). Note that the trend metrics are not used for this CU in the Learning Tree 3 algorithm, because the branch it lands on focuses on relative abundance.\nTakla-Trembleur-S sockeye (2015): The expert workshop classified this CU as Red/Amber. Learning Tree 3 assigns a WSP rapid status of Amber. The experts considered a broader suite of information to downgrade status: different probability level of the relative abundance benchmark statuses rather than just the median, and cycle-line abundance, in addition to the generational average. In addition, the experts highlighted the steep recent decline (percent change) and declining productivity (R/S) to downgrade the status assessment.\nNorth Thompson coho (2013): The expert workshop classified this CU as Amber/Green. Learning Tree 3 assigns a WSP rapid status of Green because generational average was more than 10% above the upper relative abundance benchmark (i.e., RelAbd &gt; 1.1*UBM). Experts in the status workshop used additional information with mixed signals to downgrade 32\n\fthe status: percent change was increasing, long-term trend was in the Amber or Red zone in recent years of the retrospective, productivity (R/S) was below replacement in recent years, and marine survival was low but stable.\nDiscrepancies between WSP rapid statuses and WSP integrated statuses indicate potential factors to consider in future versions of the algorithm (e.g. uncertainty in benchmark, trends in off-cycle lines, productivity, marine survival). However, it will be a challenge to develop standardized metrics for these factors that are applicable across data sets.\n3.4 PERFORMANCE IN THE RETROSPECTIVE (OUT-OF-\nSAMPLES) TEST\nStatus is intended to communicate the overall signal in the data. We tested algorithms retrospectively to evaluate the stability of statuses over time, as spawner abundances and resulting status metrics change, and across algorithms (Appendix G; Appendix H). The seven candidate algorithms were applied retrospectively to all CUs in the retrospective data set for years from 1995 to 2019, with applicable data. Figure 17 illustrates the resulting pattern in WSP rapid statuses for the Learning Tree 3 algorithm for Fraser sockeye CUs.\nOverall, this retrospective test generated 871 individual cases for which at least one metric was available for a CU, and a WSP rapid status could potentially be calculated. The total number of CUs that can be assessed increases over the course of the time series, as more data become available, and more metrics can be calculated (Figure 18 and Figure 19). This was consistent across algorithms despite large variation in the specific number of statuses completed by each.\nStatuses generally changed over the time series, but were relatively stable, staying on one status zone for one or more years, before changing to another status zone. There are examples, like Widgeon_RT (river-type) sockeye where the WSP rapid status stayed Red over the entire time series, since this CU has a small geographic distribution, and therefore, small numbers that make it more vulnerable to extinction.\nPatterns in the retrospective analysis show that the algorithms detect major population signals that are known to salmon experts. This illustrates how the algorithm results will be used within DFO’s Salmon Scanner to examine summary patterns over time, and across species/areas. Specifically, the total number of Red CUs increases over time across all algorithms (Figure 18). This pattern is interrupted in the early 2010s due to the large returns observed for several Fraser sockeye CUs in 2010, which improves some CU statuses for several years (Figure 18).\nThe consistency among algorithms in identifying CUs with Red status is reassuring for future applications of the WSP rapid status approach. This shows that the overall pattern in WSP rapid statuses is not highly sensitive to the technical details of the algorithms. A key reason for this is that participating experts in the WSP status workshops generally reached consensus relatively easily on CUs with clear-cut indications of poor status, and those consistent considerations could then be extracted by the algorithms.\nAppendix G and Appendix H document detailed results from the retrospective test. Notable observations are:\n• Appendix G, Table 49, shows the competition rate across years by CUs where a WSP rapid status could be estimated. It specifically looks at how completion rate compares based on number of algorithms (from 0 to 7), and number of metrics (from 0 to 4).\n33\n\fMetrics include relative abundance, absolute abundance, long-term trend, and percent change. An obvious result of the retrospective test is when there were 4 metric values that could be estimated, then all seven algorithms could assign status (total number of cases: 509). Conversely, when no metric values could be estimated, then there were no algorithms that could assign status (total number of cases: 316). For a varying number of metric values that could be estimated, there were a varying number of algorithms that could estimate WSP rapid status.\n• Appendix G, Table 50, also shows the completion rate across years by CU where a\nWSP rapid status could be estimated. However, it specifically looks at how completion rate compares across each of the seven candidate algorithms. There are pronounced differences in completion rate between algorithms. Learning Tree 3 was the only algorithm that could assign status to all 841 cases with two or more of the four standard metrics, outperforming all other algorithms. In cases where there were four metrics, completion rate was 100% for all seven algorithms, though among all Pacific Salmon CUs, a small proportion will have all four metrics.\n• The retrospective test identified CUs for which several of the candidate algorithms indicate a deteriorating status since the past WSP integrated status assessments (Appendix G.2). This includes two of the five coho CUs (Fraser Canyon coho, and North Thompson coho) and several sockeye CUS (5 changed from Amber to Green: Chilko-S-ES, Francois-Fraser-S, Pitt-ES, Shuswap-ES, Shuswap-L; 5 changed from Amber to Red: Chilliwack-ES, Kamloops-ES, Lillooet-Harrison-L, Nahatlatch-ES, North-Barriere-ES; and Harrison (River-type) changed from Green to Red.\n• Overall, the retrospective pattern of WSP rapid statuses was generally consistent for a CU across algorithms and years (Appendix H). What we mean by patterns is while the exact status might not be identical, directional changes in status such as improvements or deterioration in status are similar. Actual WSP rapid status designations could vary between algorithms for some years and CUs.\n• Across CUs patterns in WSP rapid statuses across time varied. Some CUs did not vary markedly over time, for example large and stable CUs like Pitt-ES, and were more consistently Green over their time series, and conversely small CUs like Taseko- ES or Widgeon river-type were consistently Red. Others showed varying statuses over time.\n3.5 PERFORMANCE IN THE RELATIVE BENCHMARK\nMETRIC SENSITIVITY TEST\nThe relative abundance metric sensitivity test compared how WSP rapid statuses changed when this metric was included or excluded from a candidate algorithm Table 11. The relative abundance metric was available for 37 of the 65 cases in the learning data set. Details on what CUs included this metric are in Appendix C. Only Learning Tree 1,2 and 3 algorithms sensitivity test results were considered further.\nTwo other algorithms can include the relative abundance metrics: Categorical Realist and Simply Red. The Categorical Realist and Simply Red, however, are relatively simple and cannot assign statuses for most cases, respectively 37/37 cases and 25/37 cases, once the relative abundance metric is excluded. Therefore, these are not discussed further below.\n34\n\fThe Minimalist does not use the relative abundance metric, so it was excluded. The Fancy Pants algorithm ran into challenges with special cases that could not be addressed with the current code. However, given the observed completion rates and errors (summarized above), Fancy Pants is not the recommended algorithm, so we did not dedicate effort to further adjust the code. Therefore, we first present the results of this sensitivity test only for the three versions of the Learning Tree, then conclude with a comparison performance of Learning Tree 3 without relative abundance metric to the much simpler Minimalist algorithm.\nCompletion rate was almost 100% for the three Learning Tree algorithms for this sensitivity analysis. There was only 1 unique case where statuses could not be assigned when the relative abundance metric was excluded (Table 11: 1 case in the Without Benchmark, Number Not Completed Row). This case is a special situation, because the initial WSP integrated assessment of Chilliwack-ES sockeye relied only on the relative abundance metric to assign status. At the time of this assessment, there was not sufficient data to calculate either percent change or long-term trend for this CU (Grant & Pestal 2012). The relative abundance metric for Chilliwack-ES required only the most recent generation of escapement data (last four years), because benchmarks were calculated using the rearing capacity of Chilliwack Lake (20% and 40% of spawners at maximum juvenile production (Smax)) (Grant et al. 2011). When the relative abundance metric was excluded, there was no other information available to assess status (Table 11: 1 case for Learning Trees).\nAs the Learning Tree evolved from 1 to 3, the algorithm became more consistent in the statuses assigned with the relative abundance metric versus without. Statuses changed when the relative abundance metric was removed for the following number of cases: Learning Tree 1: 17/37 cases; Learning Tree 2: 13/37 cases; Learning Tree 3: 9/37 cases (Table 11). Learning Tree 3 is more precautionary when the relative abundance metric is not available, compared to when it is available, and compared to Learning Trees 1 and 2. In most cases (7/9), the WSP rapid status assigned with less information (i.e. without the relative abundance metric) was poorer than with it included (Table 11: Number Worse by 1 status zone: 5; Number Worse by 2 status zones: 2; out of the total Number Changed: 9).\nThe opposite occurred with Learning Tree 1, where in most cases (13/17), the WSP rapid status assigned without the relative abundance metric was better than with it included (Table 11: Number Better by 1 status zone: 13; Number Better by 2 status zones: 1; out of the total Number Changed: 17). This is notable, because the metrics and thresholds used by Learning Tree 1 and 3 are very similar (see Section 2.4.3 for differences between Learning Tree 1 and 3).\nWhen constructing Learning Tree 3, we added a branch (at node 32, see Appendix E.7), so that one portion of the tree resembles the Minimalist algorithm. The Minimalist algorithm performed very well in terms of Number Correct and Number Close on the 3 status scale (tied for #2 rank across algorithms), despite being very simple and relying only on trends in abundance metrics. Cases that end up on this branch of the Learning Tree 3 are those CUs that have no relative abundance metric, and either have no absolute abundance data, or have absolute abundance estimates that are larger than 10,000.\nIn the relative benchmark sensitivity test, 21 CUs followed the branch of the Learning Tree 3 that resembles the Minimalist. For 19 of those 21, algorithm results matched those produced by the Minimalist. For the remaining two cases, Learning Tree 3 gives a different result, assigning Red statuses where the Minimalist assigns a WSP rapid status of Amber. For these 2 CUs the Learning Tree 3 (without the relative abundance benchmark) actually performs worse (0 correct statuses) than the Minimalist algorithm (1 correct status). However, this is because the Learning Tree 3 algorithm is intentionally more cautious for consistency with\n35\n\fCOSEWIC criterion A (as described in Section 2.4.3).\nSpecifically, the Learning Tree 3 assigns a Red status for CUs that show a 70% decline on the percent change metric, while the Minimalist algorithm requires an 80% decline on this metric to assign Red status.\n4 DISCUSSION\n4.1 WSP RAPID STATUSES\n4.1.1 Selected Algorithm: Learning Tree 3\nLearning Tree 3 (Figure 20) was selected to be used as the WSP rapid status algorithm going forward. This algorithm performed best across the seven candidate algorithms (See Section 4.1.3.1 below). The Learning Tree 3 assigns a Red, Amber or Green WSP rapid status, with a High, Medium, or Low confidence rating for CUs with applicable data.\nThe Learning Tree 3 algorithm consists of a set of decision rules that approximate the decision-making process that experts used to assign CU statuses in past WSP integrated status assessment processes (Figure 20). It assigns a WSP rapid status depending on answers to a series of Yes/No questions. The algorithm sequence is as follows:\n\nThe first question is whether or not a CU has a current absolute abundance value, and if so, whether or not this value falls below the lower threshold of 1,500 (which adds a buffer to COSEWIC’s Criterion D1 for small population size of 1,000). If the answer to this question is Yes, then the CU is assigned Red (node 3), with High confidence.\nIf the answer to the first question is No, then the second question is whether or not the CU has a current absolute abundance value, and if so, whether or not the current abundance is below the upper threshold of 10,000, which is COSEWIC’s Criterion C upper benchmark. This second question splits the decision nodes into two Pathways: Pathway 1 (No to this question) and Pathway 2 (Yes to this question).\n\no Pathway 1: is where a CU either does not have a current absolute abundance value, or has these data, and it falls above the upper threshold for this metric. This pathway is split with the question: can this CU be assessed with a relative abundance metric. If the answer is Yes, a Red (nodes 19), Amber (nodes 37) or Green (node 36) WSP rapid status is assigned, with High confidence, depending on where the current abundance value falls relative to this metric’s lower and upper thresholds. If the answer is NO, then comparisons are made between the CU’s current abundances and percent change to thresholds for these metrics, which assign a Red with Medium confidence, or Green or Amber with Low confidence status.\no Pathway 2: is where a CU has absolute abundance data, and these\nabundances fall between the lower and upper thresholds. In this pathway, absolute abundances restrict WSP rapid statuses to only Amber or Red. This pathway is split with the question: can this CU be assessed with a relative abundance metric. If the answer is Yes, an Amber (node 22) with Medium\n36\n\fconfidence, or Red (node 23) with High confidence, is assigned, depending on whether the CU’s current abundance value falls above the relative abundance metric lower threshold or below. If the CU cannot be assessed with a relative abundance metric, then it is compared to the lower threshold of the Long-Term trend metric and assigned Amber (node 20) with Medium confidence if above, or Red (node 21) with Medium confidence if below.\n4.1.2 Fitted CART Algorithms: Starting Point For Algorithm\nDevelopment\nThe fitted algorithms using CART models were a useful starting point in the algorithm development process, which concluded with Learning Tree 3. They helped us explore the range of algorithms that could be derived from the learning data set, from those that produce simple status results (Categorical Realist: Red and Not Red) to the full portfolio of status results (Fancy Pants: Red, Red/Amber, Amber, Amber/Green and Green), with one intermediate between these bookends (Minimalist: Red, Amber and Green) (Table 6).\nHowever, the fitted algorithms had several limitations. First, the small number of learning data set cases, which included only previously completed WSP integrated status assessments, limited the number of patterns the CART decision trees could extract.\nIn addition, the learning data set is not balanced across species, with 45 sockeye cases, 15 Chinook cases, and only 5 coho cases. This means that CART-fitted algorithms may be overfit to sockeye CUs, for which we have more cases, and therefore, perform less well for Chinook and coho CUs, for which we have fewer cases. This is particularly important because the sockeye CUs differ from both Chinook and coho in terms of data quality, length of CU time series, and the weighting of metrics in the WSP status assessments.\nMore metrics can typically be calculated for Fraser sockeye CUs than for Chinook CUs, and metrics for sockeye were generally considered well estimated in the WSP integrated status assessments, due to the availability of long, high quality data sets for many Fraser sockeye CUs. This translated into greater weight being placed on the relative abundance metric in the sockeye process than in the coho or Chinook assessments, where this metric was often down-weighted (coho) or not available (Chinook). Algorithms that are well fit to the learning data set therefore tend to place greater weight on the relative abundance metric than is appropriate for coho and Chinook. Finally, sockeye CUs also have very different abundance patterns than the coho CUs, with many having peaked in abundance in the late 1990s and early 2000s followed by declines. This influenced the weight attributed to the percent change metric in the WSP integrated status assessments for many sockeye CUs, which was more heavily relied upon for coho and Chinook.\nThe differences in metric weighting across WSP integrated status assessments for different species, historical trends, and data types are highly nuanced, and are not easily captured through the CART fitting process, particularly given the distribution of cases in the data set.\nThe fitted algorithms, therefore, did not represent an end point for algorithm development and selection. Instead, they provided a useful starting point for exploring and comparing the performance of a range of classification trees to support the development of constructed trees.\n37\n\f4.1.3 Constructed Algorithms: Concluding With Learning Tree 3\n4.1.3.1 Learning Tree development, performance, and broad applicability to BC\nand Yukon CUs\nThe Learning Tree algorithms were the final evolutionary step in developing the constructed algorithms. They were derived by combining components of CART-fitted trees with common rationale applied in the expert-driven WSP status assessment processes. This set of algorithms was developed iteratively as WSP status and CU experts incorporated and refined decision rules and metric thresholds and compared changes to the algorithm’s performance. The Learning Tree 3 (Figure 20) is the culmination of this iterative revision process. Already, Learning Tree 1 evolved into Learning Tree 3, improving in accuracy and over-prediction error as additional considerations were added. No further improvements in performance were found once the Learning Tree 3 algorithm version was reached.\nThe Learning Tree 3 performed best overall. It is applicable to the largest proportion of CUs in the learning data set (100% of cases), it has the highest accuracy (83% correct overall on the 3-status scale, 84% Fraser sockeye, 80% for SBC Chinook and Interior Fraser coho), and it adheres to the decision-making processes that occurred in the WSP integrated status assessments, including applying biologically conservative metric thresholds. Given that the Learning Tree 3 algorithm has the highest completion rate for the learning data set, it should also be the algorithm that is most widely applicable to other species and areas.\nLearning Tree 3 was designed to account for differences in type of data (i.e., relative index versus absolute abundance), and suite of metrics available. Learning Tree 3 provides branch options that are conditional on metric availability. This flexibility ensures its applicability across BC and Yukon CUs, where many CUs have abundance data that are indices only, and therefore, only trends in abundance metrics will be applicable.\nThe name Learning Tree was deliberately chosen to indicate that this algorithm can continue to improve over time. As new metrics and CUs are considered, additional WSP integrated status assessments are recommended. This will enable any necessary adjustments to the Learning Tree 3 algorithm, by expanding the learning data set to evaluate the performance of new Learning Tree algorithm adjustments, relative to previous versions.\nThe only other constructed algorithm Simply Red, is limited in its applicability across the range of data types and metric availability within the learning data set, due to its reliance on relative abundance and/or absolute abundance metrics to assign status. This algorithm also had among the lowest completion rate overall due to this limitation.\n4.1.3.2 Learning Tree Error\nThe Learning Tree 3 algorithm did a good job at replicating the expert decision-making processes of past WSP integrated status assessments (Grant & Pestal 2012; DFO 2015; DFO 2016; Grant et al. 2020). There are, however, nuances in the expert decision-making processes that were unique for particular CUs and could not be generalized within the Learning Tree 3 algorithm. This reflects the trade-off between having an algorithm that can rapidly and annually assess status for all Pacific Salmon CUs with applicable data, versus more detailed processes that only can assess a small percentage of CUs for single years but can address these nuances through expert input.\nNuances that could not be generalized in the Learning Tree algorithms include:\n38\n\f•\nrecent trends in productivity;\n• uncertainty in the relative abundance metric benchmarks, which placed the metric in\nadditional status zones when presented across a range of probability levels;\n•\nretrospective values of the key metrics;\n• specific cycle-line trends in the cases of some cyclic sockeye CUs; and,\n•\ninclusion of the relative abundance metric in decision-making for some Chinook CUs, where we have chosen to exclude this metric due to its inappropriate application given the data issues of the CU.\n4.1.3.3 Confidence in WSP Rapid Status\nWe incorporated a confidence rating for Learning Tree 3 statuses using three confidence categories: Low, Medium or High (Figure 20). This confidence rating largely addresses the fact that even expert consensus on a status designation, developed in a workshop setting, will be associated with higher or lower confidence, depending on the type of CU information available to assess status. Lower confidence in expert driven processes led to more divergence among experts in regards to their initial status designations (Figure 3 and Figure 4). For this reason, you cannot identify confidence using errors in the learning data set for the Learning Tree algorithm. WSP rapid status errors were associated largely with the additional information that experts used to assess WSP integrated status for particular cases, as opposed to confidence in the metrics and data available to assess status.\nHigh confidence statuses are generally those that are assigned using relative abundance and/or absolute abundance metrics. Low confidence statuses rely exclusively on long-term trend, and may also include the percent change metric, and provide statuses of Green or Amber. Medium confidence statuses include nuances between these two categories.\n4.2 CHANGES IN STATUS SINCE THE LAST WSP\nINTEGRATED STATUS ASSESSMENTS\nFour integrated status assessments under the WSP have been completed; two for Fraser sockeye, and one for Interior Fraser coho, and one for Southern BC Chinook. These assessments covered 47 CUs from three species of salmon. Learning Tree 3, the recommended algorithm, indicates changes in status for many of these CUs since their last formal integrated assessment, using available data up to 2018 or 2019, depending on the CU. The WSP rapid statuses show a deterioration since the last formal assessment for 11 of the 23 Fraser sockeye CUs, and for 4 of the 15 Southern BC Chinook CUs with enough data from wild sites to complete an assessment (Appendix G; Appendix H). The number of CUs with a Red status increased from 1995 to 2019 (Figure 18). Conversely, the percentage of CUs assigned a Green or Amber declined over time (Figure 19). This confirms the urgent need for up-to-date status assessments and demonstrates the usefulness of the recommended algorithm.\nWe are documenting the details of these status changes in a companion report, which applies the recommended Learning Tree 3 algorithm to the latest available data sets for Fraser sockeye, Interior Fraser coho, Southern BC Chinook, Fraser pink, Fraser chum, Skeena sockeye, and Nass sockeye CUs (Pestal et al. 2023).\n39\n\f4.3 LAYERS OF PRECAUTION\nWe chose to be precautionary at multiple stages of the WSP rapid status algorithm process to align this approach with the WSP integrated status assessment approach, which provides ‘true’ CU statuses. Precautionary actions taken were:\n\nTo evaluate algorithm performance, we downgraded mixed WSP integrated statuses to the poorer of the two statuses (Red/Amber became Red, Amber/Green became Amber).\nIn the evaluation of alternative algorithms, we looked at the direction of errors, and\n\nconsidered underestimates of status (e.g. assigning Amber status to a Green CU) less of a concern than overestimates of status (i.e. Criterion 2, Section 2.3).\n\nIn the Learning Tree 3 algorithm:\n\no we included a buffer of 500 above the COSEWIC absolute abundance\nCriterion D1 threshold of 1,000 for small population size; the threshold for this metric is set at 1,500. This was to account for how this metric was treated by experts in the workshops, where CU statuses were downgraded if one year in a generation fell below 1,000, if the estimates were considered uncertain, or if the generational average was close to the 1,000 threshold.\no similar to the buffer on the absolute abundance metric lower benchmark\n(previous bullet), we added a 10% buffer to the upper threshold of the relative abundance metric.\nThis level of precaution in the WSP rapid status assessment approach is consistent with IUCN and COSEWIC status evaluation approaches (Mace et al. 2008). Both IUCN and COSEWIC status assessments are precautionary, which can result in some over listing: i.e. including a wildlife species in a threat category such as Endangered, Threatened, or Special Concern, when it is close to status thresholds that delineate these statuses categories, from Not at Risk. These ‘at risk’ designations flag species for urgent closer inspection and diagnosis, to determine if conservation actions are required. The alternative, less risk averse approaches, increases the risk of misclassifying a species in a Not at Risk category in error, when it is, in fact, facing an increased risk of extinction. This would result in a critical missed opportunity to initiate conservation actions in time to prevent the species’ extinction.\nThe WSP rapid statuses are similarly designed to flag potential concerns that are meant to be further explored in subsequent evaluation processes (Section 4.4). We therefore consider it appropriate that WSP rapid statuses err on the side of caution, raising a flag in borderline cases. If a CU is assigned a WSP rapid status of Red or Amber, this is equivalent to the ‘check engine’ light coming on in a car. There are many potential reasons for the warning, and how you respond to the warning will depend on the details of the situation. But the first step after being flagged by the algorithm is to have a closer look at these cases.\nThe level of precaution in the WSP rapid status assessment approach is also consistent with the approach taken by experts in the completed WSP integrated status assessments (Appendix B; Grant & Pestal 2012; DFO 2015; DFO 2016; Grant et al. 2020).\nExamples of where experts in the WSP integrated status assessment processes included precautionary approaches are provided below:\n•\nIn the WSP integrated status assessment processes, the relative abundance metric drove status designations where it was available. In evaluating this metric, experts\n40\n\fconsidered the consistency in status across all probability levels (10% to 90%) of the estimated benchmarks to determine status. If statuses were mixed across probability levels, status was down-weighed towards the lower status level, or a mixed status was assigned (e.g. Red/Amber or Amber/Green) (Appendix B). The WSP rapid status approach compares the current generational average (or ‘dominant’ cycle, in the case of Fraser sockeye cyclic CUs), to the median (50% probability level) estimates of the relative abundance benchmarks, instead of presenting the full probability distribution of the benchmarks. Since this metric is so heavily relied upon in status designations, using only the median benchmarks in the WSP rapid status algorithm has the potential to assign overly optimistic statuses in comparison to the WSP integrated status approaches. The three decisions listed above were therefore made to remain consistent with the degree of caution applied in the expert-driven processes.\n• When considering absolute abundance in WSP integrated status workshops, experts considered uncertainty in the data, and also compared each of the past four to twelve years to the COSEWIC criterion D1 (small population size) threshold of 1,000. In contrast, the algorithm compares the last generation average abundance to the COSEWIC threshold. To make this algorithm threshold more consistent with the precautionary approach used by experts in the WSP integrated status approach, a buffer was added. The buffer accounts for data uncertainty, and some of the masking of individual low abundance years (falling below the 1,000 COSEWIC threshold) that might occur, when averaged together with larger abundance years in the most recent generation. The buffer of 500 increases the COSEWIC metric threshold to 1,500 in the algorithm.\nNote that biological thresholds for WSP rapid status are currently stationary. They do not consider deteriorating salmon productivity observed for many salmon CUs (Dorner et al. 2008, 2018; Grant et al. 2019; MacDonald et al. 2023). As the climate continues to change and habitats continue to deteriorate due to human activities, larger salmon population size thresholds may be required to ensure a CU’s persistence under these conditions (McElhany et al. 2000). See next steps section below on consideration of time-varying productivity in the WSP rapid status approach.\n4.4 FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE WSP RAPID\nSTATUS ALGORITHM (LEARNING TREE 3 ALGORITHM)\n4.4.1 Summary\nThis final section on future considerations for the Learning Tree Algorithm is organized under the following:\n\nThe second core principle of WSP rapid status assessment is the vetting of data and evaluation of statuses by CU experts that manage the data for specific groups of salmon CUs. To address this principle we present two key elements:\n\nIdentify key data processing steps;\no o Develop a data management strategy for WSP rapid status assessments.\n41\n\f2. The third core principle of the WSP rapid status algorithm is continual learning\nand refinement. Refinements to the Learning Tree 3 algorithm and how it is used can include the following (details in subsequent sections below):\no Algorithm revisions as required. This includes changes to the algorithm and/or\nadding new metrics;\no Adding or updating relative-abundance benchmarks for CUs; including\nincorporating time-varying productivity into the metrics;\no Explore revisions to data sets with hatchery influence using the Proportionate\nNatural Influence (PNI) in salmon CU statuses;\n\nWSP rapid statuses and DFO’s new Salmon Scanner Applications\n\nImproving End-User Access;\no o DFO’s Scanner (Data-Visualization tool); o Applications of WSP rapid statuses and DFO’s Salmon Scanner.\n4.4.2 The second core principle of WSP rapid status assessment is the vetting of data by CU experts that manage the data for specific groups of salmon CUs.\n4.4.2.1 Key Data Processing Steps\nData is selected and treated based on the expertise of DFO stock assessment staff, who work in collaboration with their DFO teams, and with Indigenous groups, consultants, NGO’s, etc. Through the vetting process, we eliminate any data sets or metrics that would not produce reliable status results. This also ensures that data selection and treatment is standardized. This vetting step is required to label statuses ‘WSP rapid statuses’.\nWe intend to apply the Learning Tree 3 algorithm to additional data sets from BC and Yukon watersheds as these become available for use. Work is currently being initiated to apply the Learning Tree 3 algorithm to CUs that do not have completed integrated status assessments. This includes Fraser pink and chum salmon, and Skeena and Nass sockeye salmon (Pestal et al. 2023). We will work with CU stock assessment experts to assign and evaluate statuses for these additional CUs and, if required, refine the Learning Tree 3 algorithm by moving through the following steps:\n\nReview CU-level data and calculate status metrics.\nReview a range of input specifications like the start year of the time series, the\n\ngeneration length of the CU, metric applicability (e.g., “is the relative abundance metric meaningful for this CU, given the type of data and available SR estimates?”) etc., as identified by CU experts.\n\nApply the Learning Tree 3 algorithm with a range of input specifications, as recommended by CU experts, and review preliminary WSP rapid statuses.\nRepeat steps 1-3 until there is consensus among the stock assessment experts that\n\nthe WSP rapid statuses are reasonable.\nIt is important to note that the WSP rapid status algorithm approximates more detailed processes. The key with the algorithm is that it can be used to make relative comparisons\n42\n\fbetween years within a CU, or across CUs by year given its standardized approach.\n4.4.2.2 Develop a Data Management Strategy for WSP rapid status assessments\nA key step in expanding WSP rapid status assessments is to develop a coordinated approach in DFO to manage the applicable salmon data. Due to DFO’s Pacific Salmon Strategy, there is currently both increased resourcing, and an opportunity to put these pieces in place to ensure that all applicable Pacific Salmon CU data are available annually to assess WSP rapid statuses. Note, we assume DFO Area Stock Assessment leads integrate expertise from Indigenous groups, NGO’s, consultants and others, in the management of CU stock assessment data. We recommend the following roles and responsibilities for Data Management consideration:\nDFO Pacific Salmon Strategy Initiative (PSSI) Data Policy and Analytics Team\n• Creates and maintains central database (DB): to warehouse annual composite data for WSP rapid status assessments, and annual CU WSP rapid status assessments and available WSP integrated status assessments; these data would be accessible to DFO staff and external groups: Indigenous groups, COSEWIC, IUCN, PSF, etc..\nDFO Science: Data Management Unit (DMU)\n• Establish governance: ensure annual CU composite data for WSP rapid status assessments, and WSP rapid statuses, are provided by DFO Stock Assessment leads.\n• Automate data treatment steps where possible: this includes development of\nappropriate computer code packages and input specification files; in collaboration with PSSI Data Policy and Analytics Team and DFO Stock Assessment leads.\n• Ensure standardization in approaches across CUs and years: work directly with Stock Assessment leads, and with support from State of Salmon Program (SOS) leads for new CUs.\nArea and Core DFO Stock Assessment\n• Set up data treatment and specification files: for the WSP rapid status application for new CU data sets (following data steps in previous data section); in collaboration with SOS leads and DMU;\n• Provide annual selected and treated data: for WSP rapid status application to\nDMU.\n• Support the automation of data treatment steps where possible: this includes\ndevelopment of appropriate computer code packages and input files; in collaboration with DMU and PSSI Data Policy and Analytics Team.\n• Support standardization processes across groups of CUs: led by DMU.\nDFO Science: State of the Salmon (SOS) Program (Authors of current paper)\n• Work with DFO Stock Assessment leads: to determine data needs and metric\nspecifications for WSP rapid statuses for new CU data sets being added (following data steps in previous data section); to ensure standardization across CUs and years. • Provide annual time series of WSP rapid statuses to DMU DB: Pull data from data\nbase and update rapid statuses.\n43\n\f4.4.3 The third core principle is continual learning and refinement of\nthe WSP rapid status algorithm (Learning Tree 3)\n4.4.3.1 Algorithm revisions as required\nRevising the WSP rapid status algorithm can include directly altering the decision tree, or adding new metrics. Such revisions or improvements may be identified as new CU data sets are assessed. In such cases, we recommend that experts perform additional WSP integrated status assessments, to expand the learning data set. WSP integrated status assessment processes should include DFO and Indigenous groups and other experts, similar to past processes. With the existing or updated learning data set, performance of the WSP rapid status algorithm should be re-evaluated and compared between the existing algorithm and new algorithm revisions proposed. This would ensure that the algorithm’s performance improves overall, when compared to the ‘true’ statuses, versus hyper-tuning the algorithm to particular CU cases.\nAs the number of CUs assessed through WSP rapid status assessments expands, there may be additional metrics that could be added to the Learning Tree 3 algorithm. New metric considerations, however, should align with the WSP emphasis on ‘standardized monitoring of [Pacific] salmon status’ (DFO 2005; Holt et al. 2009). We also recommend continuing to emphasize standardized metrics and additional information that focuses on abundance and trends in abundance at this time (Appendix A; Holt et al. 2009; Holt 2009; Grant et al. 2011; Grant & Pestal 2012; DFO 2015; DFO 2016; Grant et al. 2020). These status metrics are based on conservation biology theory, particularly with emphasis on two paradigms: small population size and declining population (Caughley 1994; Mace et al. 2008).\nA distribution metric currently is not included in the WSP rapid status algorithm. Distribution metrics were included in a WSP status toolkit (Holt et al. 2009), and CU distribution trends were provided in the Southern BC Chinook and Interior Fraser coho integrated status assessment processes. However, distribution information did not influence WSP integrated statuses (Appendix B; DFO 2015 & 2016). Further, no benchmarks have been resolved for distribution metrics through expert processes or research.\nDistribution metrics might be particularly important to broadly distributed CUs, like those of chum and pink salmon. Considerable information on spawning distribution exists among salmon experts within DFO and among Indigenous communities and other groups. If work is done to develop benchmarks and explore their use by experts in WSP integrated status assessment processes, distribution metrics could be added to subsequent iterations of the Learning Tree 3 algorithm. However, another important consideration is how broadly available these data will be across CUs, and how readily they can be updated annually.\nDistribution information might be more relevant for subsequent steps involving the use of rapid statuses, rather than in the evaluation of status itself. For example, available information on changes within a CU’s spawning or juvenile rearing distribution should be captured when developing recovery or rebuilding plans.\n4.4.3.2 Adding or updating relative-abundance benchmarks for CUs, including\nincorporating time varying productivity into benchmarks.\nRelative-abundance metric benchmarks should be added and updated for CUs where possible. These benchmarks are added by CU experts, based on their knowledge of the applicability of the data to this metric. Although WSP rapid statuses can be developed without 44\n\frelative-abundance metrics, the confidence in WSP rapid statuses increases when these metrics are available.\nBroad declines in Canadian salmon abundances and productivity suggest that time-varying productivity should be considered in the relative abundance metric benchmarks. This is recommended for CUs where persistent changes in abundances and productivity have occurred. Time-varying productivity benchmarks, estimated from stock-recruitment models, were used in the first WSP integrated status assessment process for Fraser sockeye (Grant et al. 2011; Grant & Pestal 2012). However, these were not included in the subsequent WSP integrated status assessment since statuses of these CUs had returned to average, relative to the previous five years of poor productivity (Grant et al. 2020). Therefore, the more recent WSP integrated status assessment for Fraser sockeye CUs relied on models that considered average productivity for each CU (Grant et al. 2021). Since this last assessment, however, productivity declines have resumed. Further, since climate change is expected to continue to significantly change the quality of ecosystems and habitats, persistent CU productivity and distribution changes are expected (Bush and Lemmen 2019; Cheung and Frölicher 2020; IPCC 2021).\nIncorporating time-varying productivity into relative abundance benchmarks is challenging when CU productivity has not stabilized (Peterman et al. 2003; Dorner et al. 2008, 2018; Malick et al. 2017), and when large productivity shifts continue to occur between years (Grant et al. 2021). Questions to consider include: how often to adjust benchmarks to account for time-varying CU productivity; how to interpret status over time if benchmarks are adjusted frequently, or are not adjusted despite productivity changes; and how to ensure consistency in applying time-varying productivity considerations to benchmarks in the WSP rapid status algorithm. Work is on-going in DFO to investigate these types of questions and develop guidelines in regard to developing and applying time-varying productivity to status and other applications such as forecasts (C.A Holt, DFO, pers. comm.).\n4.4.3.3 Explore revisions to data sets with hatchery influence using the\nProportionate Natural Influence (PNI) in salmon CU statuses\nHatcheries are expected to play an increasing role in the conservation of salmon CUs. Hatchery enhancement programs are being expanded for this purpose through DFO’s Pacific Salmon Strategy Initiative (PSSI). Although all WSP integrated status assessments to date have attempted to exclude hatchery populations (Grant et al. 2011; Brown et al. 2019), this may be increasingly challenging to do going forward given the larger role hatcheries will play in salmon conservation.\nRecent work explores Proportionate Natural Influence (PNI) in hatchery influenced salmon (Withler et al. 2018). The PNI is a metric used to assess the genetic risks of hatchery production on natural populations as an index of gene flow. Guidance provided in a recent publication is being considered for adjusting which salmon populations should be included for a CU status assessment, depending on the level of PNI (see Table 3, in Withler et al. 2018).\n45\n\f4.4.4 Applications for WSP rapid statuses and DFO’s new Salmon\nScanner\n4.4.4.1 DFO’s Salmon Scanner: Improving End-User Access\nWSP rapid statuses generated by the WSP rapid status algorithm have been incorporated into DFO’s Salmon Scanner. This is an interactive data visualization tool for Pacific salmon. It is specifically designed for experts to support scientific discovery and help them contribute science to decision-making processes. Experts are those with expertise on Pacific salmon including stock assessment biologists, Indigenous groups, research scientists, habitat, harvest, and hatchery management biologists etc.\nDFO’s Salmon Scanner centralizes and makes WSP rapid statuses and key salmon data readily available to experts, including escapement, recruitment, life-history, and spawner distribution. DFO’s Salmon Scanner enables technical experts to explore trends across CUs on different spatial, temporal, biological, and management-based scales. A key feature of DFO’s Scanner is that it only includes quality-controlled data sets, prepared and vetted by CU experts for the purpose of WSP status assessments (see preceding data sections).\nDFO’s Salmon Scanner design process began over three years ago with structured questionnaires with 25+ experts across DFO Science and other management Sectors, academia, Indigenous groups. This was implemented to determine what these experts needed to do for their salmon-related work, but at the time were unable to. We then summarized the key tasks and priorities identified in the answered questionnaires to focus the design features of the Scanner. We used this information to create a basic Scanner version using Tableau, which is a visual analytics platform that facilitates prototyping. Initial design features were explored in this platform with experts by iteratively testing and making refinements. Design work was led by Dr. M. Barrus, an expert in software design.\nAfter finalizing DFO’s Scanner’s design through this process, we re-developed in R-Shiny, and continued iterative testing and making refinements. R-Shiny provides considerably more flexibility to implement design features we identified through the expert-testing process. R- Shiny is a widely used freeware with many applications in fisheries science and decision support. We used DFO’s Salmon Scanner in a 40+ person three day workshop to test various uses of this application. Like any software where regular updates and new releases occur, the Scanner will continue to evolve and change, as feedback is gained from on-going use.\nIn the coming months the current version of DFO’s Salmon Scanner will be made available to DFO and external salmon technical experts, through individual and group sessions. It has been designed as a code package to be run on R, but can also be used in a browser format. To provide the source code for analysts, we have developed the rapid_status() function, which generates statuses using all the candidate algorithms, including the recommended Learning Tree 3. This code runs fast in R, and has been refined to handle many different types of special cases that may come up. The rapid_status function can be shared in several alternative formats: add it to the WSPMetrics R package available on Github; create a stand- alone RapidStatus package on Github; or offer a downloadable script. However, the analysis has a substantial learning curve in terms of setting up the data and interpreting the output, and may require an interactive application (e.g. in shiny) that guides users through each step and assists with interpretation. Setting up a basic app prototype could be fairly quick, but substantial design work and end-user testing would be needed to move from an app that works to an app that actually gets used, and used properly.\n46\n\f4.4.4.2 The Salmon Scanner Design Features\nDFO’s Salmon Scanner is divided into seven interactive tabs:\n• Filter Data Tab (Figure 21): enables filtering data sets of interest by species,\nconservation unit, stock management unit, data availability, freshwater adaptive zone, life-history (such as stream-, river-, ocean-, lake-type), and average generation length. With this tab the expert can either choose to use the entire data set in subsequent tabs by not selecting anything, or narrow down specifically what they want to focus on by making selections.\n• View and Highlight on Map Tab (Figure 21): this is the central component of DFO’s Salmon Scanner. It enables experts to view the salmon watersheds throughout BC and the Yukon, through connected stream systems. CUs are mapped and can be colour-coded relative to WSP rapid statuses for user-specified year of interest, but can also be colour-coded relative to the stock management units, life-history traits, and more. The map can be interacted with, zoomed in and out, displayed in satellite mode, and other functionality end-users are familiar with from mapping applications. When CUs are selected, detailed time series and status information is presented in a lower panel under the map.\n• Time Series Plots Tab (Figure 22): displays interactive figures that correspond to the filtered and selected CUs from the previous two tabs. This tab can produce publication or presentation figures that can be adjusted based on user specifications on colour, font size, labels, and more.\n• Compare CUs Tab: only available in expert-user mode, this tab uses a parallel\ncoordinates plot to enable the user to select CUs based on more detailed specifications by the user.\n• Table and Download Tab (Figure 22): provides tabular access to directly interact with\nthe data (e.g. alternative sorting) and download it for other applications.\n• Summary Reports Tab: summarize the information the user has filtered and selected\nacross freshwater adaptive zones, stock management units, etc.\n• Markdown Reports Tab: provides pdf reports that summarize status trends for\nselected CUs over time; and provides one page CU summaries with plots of the time series, metrics and WSP rapid statuses.\n4.4.4.3 Applications of WSP rapid statuses and DFO’s Salmon Scanner DFO’s Salmon Scanner is designed for technical experts working on salmon. DFO’s Salmon Scanner can be used by individual experts to support their work, by researchers to explore and develop hypotheses, by salmon management sectors to plan and evaluate outcomes of management actions, and by Indigenous groups, and others to support decision-making processes and other requirements.\nIn DFO’s Salmon Scanner, WSP rapid statuses are a diagnostic tool to highlight potential issues and monitor trends across all of BC and Yukon Pacific salmon CUs, with sufficient data. This is particularly important as environmental conditions are broadly deteriorating due to climate change, and other human activities (Grant et al. 2019; IPCC 2022b).\nDFO Science’s State of the Salmon Program will use DFO’s Salmon Scanner in expert processes to develop regular state of the salmon reports on salmon responses to changing\n47\n\fconditions. Individual experts can also use DFO’s Salmon Scanner to compare and contrast salmon CU statuses over time to determine how statuses are changing, and how CUs of interest compare to other CUs in BC and the Yukon. Scientists can explore broad hypotheses about trends in salmon statuses over time and space.\nHatchery, harvest and habitat experts can explore annual WSP rapid statuses and salmon abundance trends from DFO’s Salmon Scanner to determine whether or not CU statuses are responding to management actions. This can support adaptive management to prioritize, improve or adjust, among their current practices.\nDFO’s Salmon Scanner can also be used to support rapid responses to emergencies like landslides, contaminant spills, forest fires, flooding, etc. For example, using the spatially- connected river systems mapped in DFO’s Salmon Scanner, all CUs upstream of a particular mainstem location can be quickly selected and reviewed. Prior to DFO’s Salmon Scanner there was no way to quickly access information on salmon that might be affected by an incident, such as the Big Bar landslide in the Fraser River that initially blocked salmon passage past the site (Government of B.C. et al. 2019). The Scanner fills this gap and also provides a efficient way to monitor the response of salmon to these events at the CU level.\nFor decision-making, expert-driven processes will be developed to validate WSP rapid statuses. Expert-driven processes can combine WSP rapid statuses with other information in DFO’s Salmon Scanner, supported by expert input and knowledge of CUs. This could be similar to past WSP integrated status assessment processes (Grant & Pestal 2012; Grant et al. 2020; DFO 2015; DFO 2016), using WSP rapid statuses as a foundation. The availability of WSP rapid statuses and associated data can streamline this work going forward, and also support similar Pacific Salmon status assessments conducted by COSEWIC.\nOne important decision-making context involves applying WSP rapid statuses to the science- based evaluation of limit reference points (LRP) for stock management units (SMUs), which are groups of CUs currently managed together as an aggregate (DFO 2023; Holt et al. 2023a, 2023b). WSP rapid statuses have been recommended as the approach to support this work (DFO 2023; Holt et al. 2023a, 2023b). In LRP evaluations, CU’s WSP rapid statuses will be combined with related information provided by CU experts to assign statuses to CUs within SMUs. A Red status CU will trigger an SMU rebuilding plan under the Fisheries Act. The purpose of using the WSP rapid status approach as a foundation to these SMU LRP assessments is to provide an objective determination of status, grounded in conservation biology principles. This scientific approach also supports standardization and comparability across years and CUs.\nThe first batch of SMU’s prioritized for LRP status assessments include Okanagan Chinook, Interior Fraser coho, and West Coast Vancouver Island Chinook. We are currently working on a standard data summary package and process with DFO, Indigenous and other technical experts related to salmon status and associated data to develop short narratives for the results and concluded outcomes of these assessments. A second DFO technical report (Pestal et al. 2023) provides the framework for the one page results package for each CU, to support the development of narratives.\nThe WSP rapid statuses with expert input, can also be combined with non-science considerations before and after rebuilding plans are triggered:\n• Before rebuilding plans are triggered by DFO science branch, SMUs are prioritized for consideration in the rebuilding plan process. Prioritization includes both scientific and management considerations. Prioritization can include combining WSP rapid statuses with expert input to determine whether or not the SMU is below its LRP. However,\n48\n\fprioritization also includes other social, cultural, economic and other factors such as considerations of First Nations Food, Social and Ceremonial needs, international treaty obligations, various stakeholder interests, the vulnerability of CUs to climate change, and more.\n• After rebuilding plans are triggered by DFO science using WSP rapid status results and expert input, determination of rebuilding actions is led by management, with scientific inputs. SMU statuses, based on statuses of individual CUs within the LRP process, can be used to help isolate the particular CUs that require rebuilding considerations. This helps to narrow down the scope of the rebuilding plan. It also can help prioritize the type of actions to be taken. For example, though a small but persistent CU may not need specific actions to increase its population size (i.e. rebuild), it likely would require increased protection and maintenance of its existing habitat, due to its small and restricted geographic range and increased extinction risk. CUs of pink or chum salmon, for example, span broad geographic areas in freshwater, therefore, the risk of environmental change or catastrophe are moderated. In contrast, smaller sockeye CUs are likely much more vulnerable to any perturbation or extreme event, which is occurring at an increasing frequency due to climate change.\nDFO’s Salmon Scanner can be used to integrate knowledge to support climate change vulnerability assessments (CCVA’s) and climate change scenario planning. As mentioned, processes will be developed to validate statuses for use within such applications, as determined by experts.\nLastly, WSP rapid status assessments can be used as a prioritization tool for developing WSP integrated statuses using the established process of expert workshops. No official planning cycle has been developed to conduct detailed integrated status assessments or reassessments across the Pacific Region’s CUs, even though this was recommended in each of the previous processes (Grant & Pestal 2012; DFO 2015, 2016; Grant et al. 2020). WSP rapid statuses can be used to flag groups of CUs that might require more detailed status assessments. This may be particularly useful for CUs comprised of species or population traits that were not reflected in the previous WSP integrated status assessments. Interpretation and usage of WSP rapid statuses will differ depending on each specific application.\n5 CONCLUSIONS\nThe Learning Tree 3 algorithm will be used to provide annual WSP rapid statuses for Pacific salmon CUs in BC and the Yukon, with applicable data. This algorithm assigns a Red, Amber or Green status annually, with High, Medium or Low confidence ratings. This algorithm performed best across a suite of seven candidate algorithms, when evaluated against quantitative and qualitative criteria. The WSP rapid status algorithm will be broadly accessible to experts through DFO’s Salmon Scanner, and interactive data visualization tool to support scientific discovery and decision making.\nThe WSP rapid status approach ensures that statuses are scientifically objective, consistent, and comparable across BC/Yukon CUs. It also ensures that they are relatively easy to implement, broadly applicable to data rich and data poor CUs, and can be updated annually. This approach is grounded in the principles of conservation biology, which emphasize abundance and trends in abundance criteria to evaluate conservation risk (Caughly 1994;\n49\n\fMace et al. 2009. They are also grounded in past scientific research and processes where CUs were identified (Holtby & Ciruna 2007; Grant et al. 2011; Brown et al. 2019), and CU statuses were assessed (Holt 2009; Holt et al. 2009; Holt 2010; Grant et al. 2011; Grant and Pestal 2012; DFO 2015, 2016; Grant et al. 2020) (Appendix A).\nThe WSP rapid status algorithm is designed to be flexible. It can assess status for CUs that have absolute abundance or indices of abundance data. It can improve as more CUs are added for status assessments, and as new methods are developed to consider time-varying productivity in relative abundance benchmarks, distribution information, etc. It is named the Learning Tree for this reason. If new metrics are added to the algorithm, we recommend that expert-driven WSP integrated status assessment processes are conducted to ground-truth how they influence WSP status determinations.\nThe ability to track the state and distribution of salmon biodiversity with WSP rapid statuses within DFO’s Salmon Scanner comes at a critical time. We are facing a period of accelerating climate and habitat change, which will require timely decisions on where to invest conservation efforts related to salmon and their habitats. The WSP rapid status approach will help support these efforts.\n50\n\fLITERATURE CITED\nBrown, G.S., Baillie, S.J., Thiess, M.E., Bailey, R.E., Candy, J.R., Parken, C.K., and Willis, D.M. 2019.

Note that although the WSP initially only identified three status zones (DFO 2005), two additional status zones were added in subsequent WSP integrated assessment processes: Red/Amber and Amber/Green (Grant & Pestal 2012). WSP integrated status assessments also designated some CUs as either data deficient (DD) or undetermined (UD). As part of the current work on WSP rapid status assessments, we also tested a lower-resolution status scale with 2 zones: Red vs. Not Red (see Table 4).\nStatus\nDefinition\nRed\nPoor status CU at imminent threat of extinction [revised definition, given alignment with COSEWIC Endangered status zone]\nRed/ Amber\nAmber\nAmber/ Green\nGreen\nDD\nUD\nIntermediate between Red and Amber\n“While a CU in the Amber zone should be at low risk of loss, there will be a degree of lost production. Still, this situation may results when CUs share risk factors with other, more productive units”\nIntermediate between Amber and Amber\n“identif[ies] whether harvest are greater than the level expected to provide on an average annual basis, the maximum annual catch for a CU, given existing conditions…there would not be a high probability of losing the CU”\nData deficient. CUs have been designated as DD if there is no data available, or if the available data is insufficient for calculating status metrics (after quality control).\nUndetermined. CUs have been designated as UD if data are available and metrics have been calculated, but the expert participants in the status workshops could not settle on a consensus WSP integrated status.\nNot Red\nUsed explicitly in the ‘Simply Red’ algorithm and on a 2 status scale: Red versus Not Red (see Table 4). Not Red includes: Amber, Amber/Green, and Green statuses. Conversely, the Red status zone includes: Red and Red/Amber statuses.\n57\n\fTable 2: Classification Tree Terminology. The approach of extracting algorithms using Classification and Regression Trees (CART) is widely used in decision analysis and machine learning. The approach is very versatile but comes with highly specialized terminology. This table defines key terms.\nTerm\nDescription\nClassification Tree Nested sequence of criteria that classifies cases into different categories (e.g.\nBinary Split\nRecursive Partitioning\nNode\nfield guide for species identification).\nCriterion for separating a set of cases into 2 subsets\nStep-wise splitting of a sample into smaller subsets of cases that are similar to each other (e.g. sort test fishing catch by species, then by sex, then by size category).\nA fork in the classification tree. Nodes are systematically numbered. The root node is 1. Nodes created by each binary split are numbered as double for the NO subset and double +1 for the YES subset (e.g. node 4 splits into nodes 8 and 9). This way, even-numbered nodes are always the result of NO in the parent node, and the number of each node uniquely defines the full path up to that node (e.g. cases in node 17 are the result of YES in node 8, NO in node 4, NO in node 2, and NO in node 1).\nBranch\nA node the leads to another node\nLeaf (a.k.a terminal node)\nLoss function\nAsymmetric loss function\nA node at the end of a branch, resulting in a classification.\nAssigns a penalty for each type of error. This is a more flexible version of the sum-of-squared errors in a regression fit, which can be customized to handle qualitative errors (e.g. species misidentifications).\nClassification errors may have different implications depending on the direction of the error (e.g. classifying a poisonous mushroom as edible has worse consequences than the reverse error). These considerations can be built into the tree fitting step by specifying an asymmetric loss function, that results in heavier penalties for one type of error compared to another.\nComplexity Penalty Tree fitting can apply a penalty for the number of branches, to ‘prune’ the tree\nand avoid overfitting the data. This is equivalent to choosing among alternative regression models based on criteria that consider model complexity, such as adjusted R2 or Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC).\nLearning Data Set\nSample of cases where the correct classification is known. This is used to fit the trees and is equivalent to the data used to estimate parameters for a forecasting model.\nTest Data Set\nNew set of cases (with or without known correct classifications) used to assess performance of the fitted tree. This is equivalent to generating a forecast based on estimated parameters and new values for the predictor variables.\nConfusion Matrix\n2-way contingency table showing true classifications versus classifications assigned by the tree.\nSurrogate Split\nSoftware used to fit classification trees also identifies surrogate splitting criteria. If data for the main criterion is not available, it will use any alternate information that closely replicates the split generated by the main criterion.\n58\n\fTable 3: Alternative Settings for CART Explorations. When fitting classification trees, similar to fitting regression models, there are many available options for the inputs, outputs, and settings (e.g. variables to include, variable transformations, alternative model forms). This table lists the variations we explored and screened to develop a shortlist of fitted algorithms for more detailed evaluation (Section 2.4.2). R: Red; RA: Red/Amber; A: Amber; AG: Amber/Green; G: Green; DD: data deficient; UD: undetermined.\nSetting\nVariations\nResponse Variable\n• WSP integrated statuses (R/RA/A/AG/G)\n•\nsimplified statuses (R/A/G)\n• WSP integrated status scores (1-5)\nPredictor Variable\nModel Fits\nData Set\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\n•\nsimplified status scores (1-3)\nexponential WSP integrated status scores (e.g. G=1,AG=2,A=4,RA=8, R=16,DD=0,UD=0)\nNumeric metric values\nmetric statuses (R/A/G)\ncomplexity penalty\nasymmetric penalty function (error direction matters)\nuse all cases\nfit separate tree by species\nfit separate trees by data type\n59\n\fTable 4: Alternative status scales for evaluating algorithm performance. WSP rapid statuses were converted to scores from 1 to 5 to capture the magnitude and direction of classification errors. WSP rapid statuses need to be simplified to the same scale as the WSP integrated status assessments to make meaningful comparisons within algorithm and between algorithms. The five status scale is the scale used in previous WSP integrated status assessments. Different WSP rapid status candidate algorithms were developed to assess status on one of the three scales (Table 6), with statuses converted to each of the three scales for performance evaluation (Table 7).\n5 Status Scale\n3 Status Scale\n2 Status Scale\nZone\nRed\nRed/Amber\nAmber\nAmber/Green\nGreen\nScore Zone\nScore\nZone\nScore\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\nRed\nAmber\nGreen\n5\n3\n1\nRed\nNot Red\n5\n2\nTable 5: Total completed WSP integrated status assessments for Fraser sockeye, Southern BC Chinook, Interior Fraser coho. This table shows the frequency of status designations from the three integrated assessments and one re-assessment for Fraser sockeye completed under the WSP (Grant and Pestal 2012; DFO 2015, 2016). To create more comparable results with particular algorithms, the five status scale was converted into the three (Red, Amber or Amber), or two (Red/Not Red) status scales (see Table 4 above). The table also summaries the number of Data Deficient (DD) CUs and Undetermined (UD) statuses for each species. Detailed metrics and statuses in Appendix C. Total CUs Assessed is less than Total Statuses Assigned, because Fraser sockeye have been assessed twice (22 CUs in first assessment, 23 CUs in the reassessment).\nStatus Zone\nRed Red/Amber Amber Amber/Green Amber DD UD Total CUs Assessed Total Statuses Assigned Red Status\nSockeye Status Scale 3 20\n2 20\nChinook Status Scale 3 12\n5 11 1 1 0 2 4 0 19\n15\n2 12\n3\n4 0 19\n15\n1\n2 4 0 19\n15\n17\n8 0 1 23\n45\n25\n0 1 23\n45\n5 14 6 9 8 8 0 1 23\n45\n0.31\n0.44\n0.44\n0.73\n0.8\n0.8\n60\nCoho Status Scale 3\n2\n5\n0 0 3 2 0 0 0 5\n5\n0\n0\n5\n0 0 0 5\n5\n0\n0\n5\n0 0 5\n5\nTotal Status Scale 3 32\n5 25 7 13 10 10 4 1 47\n65\n2 32\n33\n4 1 47\n65\n23\n10 4 1 47\n65\n0\n0.38\n0.49\n0.49\n\fTable 6: The seven candidate rapid status algorithms. Three fitted algorithms based on exploring alternative CART model fits, and four constructed algorithms based on combining CART fits with additional considerations. The fitted algorithms used all 65 cases from the learning data set. Exploratory CART fits using data split by species or data type were unstable and were therefore not included in the shortlist of candidate algorithms for detailed testing. Constructed algorithms use components of the fitted algorithms, so indirectly use all available data. This table summarizes the design approach for each algorithm. Section 2.4 describes the development steps. Appendix D shows the full algorithms as a diagram and as a set of classification rules. Note that these algorithms generate rapid statuses at different scales of resolution, from 5 (Red, Red/Amber, Amber, Amber/Green, Green), to 3 (Red, Amber, Green) to 2 (Red, Not Red), as shown by the ‘x’ in the right-hand columns (R = Red, nR = Not Red, RA = Red/Amber, A = Amber, AG = Amber/Green, G = Green) (see Table 4).\nType\nName\nDescription\nFitted\nMinimalist\nAppendix E.1\nFancy Pants\nAppendix E.2\nCategorical Realist\nAppendix E.3\nConstr- ucted\nSimply Red\nAppendix E.4\n• 3 status scale: simplified status scale • Built using only the values for trend metrics: long-term & percent change, which are broadly available metrics common to most CUs\n• Tree fitting with high complexity penalty to generate a\nsimple tree with few branches.\n• 5 status scale: matches WSP integrated status scale • Built using values for all available metrics • Tree fitting with low complexity penalty to generate a more complex tree with finer resolution with more branches.\nR\nX\nnR RA A\nAG G\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\n• 2 status scale: simplified status scale • Simplified metrics:\nabsolute abundance and long-term trend\nabundance,\nX\nX\nrelative\n• Fit separate trees for different data types, but only R and A\nwere isolated as terminal nodes by the tree fit.\n• 2 status scale: simplified status scale • Simplified metrics: long-term trend, percent change, and\nX\nX\nrelative abundance\n• Combines all the criteria from the other algorithms that\nflag a R status\nLearning Tree 1\nAppendix E.5\nLearning Tree 2\nAppendix E.6\nLearning Tree 3\nAppendix E.7\n• 3 status scale: simplified status scale • Built on the CART algorithms but combined with WSP\nintegrated status assessment narratives.\n• 3 status scale: simplified status scale • Same as Learning Tree 1 but use R/A/G metrics instead of\nmetric values.\n• 3 status scale: simplified status scale • Evolution of Learning Tree 1, putting absolute abundance first, and providing additional considerations for long-term trend and percent change metrics.\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\n61\n\fTable 7: Summary of algorithm performance across all 65 cases in the learning data set: Fraser sockeye, Southern BC Chinook and Interior Fraser coho CUs. Note in the learning set there are two years with WSP integrated status assessments completed for Fraser sockeye CUs, in addition to one year for Southern BC Chinook CUs and one year for Interior Fraser coho CUs. The table shows the completion rate (Number Complete): the number of cases the algorithm could assign a WSP rapid status to out of the total 65 learning data set cases; number of correct designations (Number Correct): the rapid status matches WSP integrated status; the number of close designations (Number Close): the rapid status is only 1 status zone different from the WSP integrated status; and the number of overestimates (Number Predicted Better): the rapid status is better than the WSP integrated status. Median, Mean and Range of Errors are presented in the last 3 rows. All errors are calculated by converting status designations to a 2, 3, or 5-status scale (see Table 4 to Table 6 for details). The status scale that matches the algorithm is marked with bold font and grey shading. A negative error means that the algorithm assigned a worse status than the integrated expert assessment. Table cells are highlighted in orange if a rapid status could be assigned for less than 3/4 of the cases (Number Complete &lt; 49/65), or if the mean error was larger than 0.3 (Mean &lt; -0.3 or Mean &gt; 0.3).

The relative abundance metric is available for 37 of the 65 cases in the learning data set. This metric is used by the following algorithms: Categorical Realist, Simply Red, and Learning Tree 1, 2, and 3. The Minimalist does not use the relative abundance metric, so it was excluded. The Categorical Realist and Simply Red were included, but since they are relatively simple, they cannot assign statuses for 37/37 and 25/37 cases, respectively. This table shows the number of cases where the algorithm could assign status (Number Completed) vs. where the algorithm could not assign a status (Number Not Completed). This is presented for the two scenarios: With and Without relative abundance metric (RA). It also shows the number of cases where the rapid status changed, as well as the direction and magnitude of the changes. Notable results are highlighted in orange.

Status zones delineated by lower and upper benchmarks from Red, which designates poor status, up to Green, which is a healthy status. Reprinted from Fisheries and Oceans Canada (2005). Note that statuses for individual metrics are combined into a single WSP integrated status assessment, which add two intermediate status zones (Red/Amber, Amber/Green; Table 1).\nFigure 2. Hierarchy for the assessment of biological status of CUs under the WSP. Components include 1) four classes of indicators, 2) metrics within each indicator class, and 3) benchmarks on each metric; 4) statuses for each metric; 5) integrated or rapid statuses that rolls all the metric statuses into a single status for a CU. Revised from Holt et al. (2009).\n68\n\fFigure 3. Summary of group results for WSP integrated status assessments in the first Fraser sockeye WSP assessment. This figure reproduces Table 3 from Grant and Pestal (2012). Participants worked in six groups. Status designations were labelled provisional if a group did not reach consensus. The majority view is shown in the columns on the left, but the number of groups with provisional status designations is also included. For example, ‘2 Red’ for Quesnel-S means that two of the five groups that settled on a Red status had some dissenting views. By comparison, the ‘1’ in the Amber column for Quesnel-S means that there was one group that reached a consensus designation of Amber, which could not be reconciled with the results from the other five groups through plenary discussion.\n69\n\fFigure 4. Example of group results for WSP integrated status assessments in the Southern BC Chinook WSP assessment. Participants worked in 6 groups, reviewing data summaries for a set of unidentified CUs, then posting the group results on the wall for a facilitated plenary discussion to determine a consensus status designation where possible. CU names were then revealed, and status designations finalized through further facilitated plenary discussions. In this example, the status assignments by individuals group mostly matched, and for all four cases there was a clear majority agreement on CU status, even though this set of CUs specifically included cases where trend metrics showed mixed signals (i.e. long-term trend and percent change metrics indicated different statuses).\n70\n\fFigure 5. WSP Rapid statuses for each Fraser sockeye CU (rows) and candidate algorithms (first seven columns), compared to WSP integrated statuses using data up to 2010 (last 3 columns) (Grant & Pestal 2012). The WSP integrated statuses were assigned on a 5 status scale (marked with *) (Grant and Pestal 2012); these were also converted to a 3 and 2 status scales for better comparisons to particular algorithms (see Table 4 to Table 6 for details). For some cases, all or most algorithms could assign a status and the rapid statuses match the WSP integrated assessment (e.g. Bowron_ES, Cultus_L, Nahatlatch-ES, Takla_Trembleur_EStu,Taseko_ES; Widgeon_RT). For others, different algorithms and WSP integrated statuses spanned multiple status zones (e.g. Harrison_US_L).\n71\n\fFigure 6.

Retrospective pattern of Learning Tree 3 WSP rapid statuses (rows) for Fraser sockeye CUs (columns) from 1995 to 2019. This figure illustrates the retrospective application of one algorithm to a subset of the CUs in the learning data set. It shows how statuses change several times since 1995 for some CUs (e.g. Harrison_R), while others are consistent for all or most of that time period (e.g. Widgeon_RT, Anderson_Seton_ES), and still others show a directional change to worsening status (e.g. Seton_L, Harrison_US_L, Takla-Trembleur_EStu). Appendices D and E show detailed retrospective results for all the CUs and candidate algorithms. Figure 18 and Figure 19 summarize the pattern over time across all CUs.\n83\n\fFigure 18. Summary of retrospective WSP rapid statuses – number of completed CUs and number of Red statuses for Fraser sockeye, Southern BC Chinook and Interior Fraser coho CUs. Total is the number of CUs with at least one status metric available for that year. Compl is the number of completed WSP rapid statuses assigned. Red is the number of CUs assigned a Red status by that algorithm. The retrospective test started in 1995. Earlier spawner data are available for many of the CUs, but metric availability varies a lot for the earlier parts of the time series due to individual metric requirements, for example, at least 3 generations of data (12-15 years) are needed to calculate the percent change metric.\n84\n\fFigure 19.

Refer to Figure 18 for the number and percent of cases that were completed. The proportion of CUs assigned to Red status follows the same pattern for all the algorithms except the Categorical Realist. Amber and Amber status assignments, however, differ between algorithms. The retrospective test started in 1995. Earlier spawner data are available for many CUs, but metric availability varies a lot for the earlier parts of the time series due to individual metric requirements, for example, at least 3 generations of data (12-15 years) are needed to calculate the percent change metric.\n85\n\fFigure 20. WSP rapid status Learning Tree 3 algorithm. This is the selected rapid status algorithm, where a CU’s metric values are compared to algorithm thresholds to determine final rapid status. Yes or no answers to these different decision points split the paths on the decision tree, terminating at rapid status assignments of Red, Amber or Green. The different splits in each pathway are identified as nodes, numbered from 1 to 65. Pathway 1 is taken when the CU has no absolute abundance data, or these data exist, but fall above its upper benchmark of 10,000. Pathway 2 is taken when the CU has absolute abundance data and these fall under its upper benchmark of 10,000. AbsAbd: absolute abundance; AbsLBM: absolute abundance lower benchmark; AbsUBM: absolute abundance upper benchmark; Rel LBM: relative abundance lower benchmark; LongTrend: is long-term trend metric; %Change: percent change metric; RelUBM: relative abundance upper benchmark. Confidence ratings for each end node are shown below the node. Section 2.5 describes the rationale for the confidence ratings.\n86\n\fA)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 21.

This Appendix specifically covers the alignment of the WSP rapid status approach with the WSP and scientific peer-reviewed publications.\nDFO’s WSP recognizes the importance of salmon biodiversity (DFO 2005). Greater biodiversity reduces the risk of extinction by increasing the likelihood that salmon species and some populations will be able to withstand the changing circumstances and survive. Salmon biodiversity can also buffer their overall abundances from periods of environmental change, where some salmon traits are better adapted to different conditions than others. This has been referred to as the portfolio effect, where greater diversity is able to maintain more stable abundances to support harvest and ecosystem function (Schindler et al. 2010).\nThe WSP identifies implementation strategies that are designed to maintain diversity and abundances of Pacific Salmon to the fullest extent possible. But the WSP also acknowledges that there likely will be circumstances when losses of wild salmon populations are unavoidable. Some catastrophic events are beyond human control and DFO may not be able to restore habitat or spawning populations damaged by such events.\nPacific salmon are now facing significant challenges attributed to human activities, including accelerating global climate change, and others such as land-use, invasive species, disease and pollution, which are embedded within the overarching context of climate change (Grant et al. 2019). In response, Canadian Pacific salmon populations are generally exhibiting considerable declines in abundances and productivity, and consequently harvest has been significantly reduced (Grant et al. 2019; Grant et al. 2021;NPAFC 2019).\nThe rate of climate change in an area may exceed the ability of some salmon populations to adjust. Recent studies suggests that northward range contractions are likely for Pacific Salmon, and that some populations will be more vulnerable than others to local extinctions (Crozier et al. 2019, 2021; Cheung and Frölicher 2020). Although the intent of the WSP is to minimize biodiversity loss through fisheries or habitat degradation, where possible, it is unrealistic to expect that all losses can be avoided in natural environments.\nThis is consistent with expectations for Atlantic diadromous species in eastern North America. Diadromous species like Pacific and Atlantic salmon are more at risk to climate change given their complex life-cycles that rely on freshwater and marine habitats where impacts are cumulative. Atlantic diadromous species, which include Atlantic salmon, had the highest proportion vulnerable to climate change across 82 fish and benthic invertebrate species assessed in a recent climate change vulnerability assessment (Hayes and Kocik 2014; Hare et al. 2016).\nTracking Pacific salmon biodiversity is important for evaluating salmon responses to changing environmental conditions, to help identify and prioritize management actions when combined with other biological and socio-economic information, and also to evaluate the success of actions taken to reduce biodiversity and abundance losses. DFO’s WSP Strategy 1 outlines a broad approach to tracking salmon biodiversity through standardized monitoring of wild\n89\n\fsalmon status. Within Strategy 1, the WSP prescribes three actions steps:\n•\n•\n•\nAction Step 1.1.: Identify Conservation Units (CUs)\nAction Step 1.2: Develop Criteria to Assess CUs and Identify Benchmarks to Represent Biological Status\nAction Step 1.3: Monitor and Assess CU status\nA.2 WSP ACTION STEP 1.1: IDENTIFY CONSERVATION UNITS\nThe Conservation Unit (CU) has been identified as the fundamental unit of biodiversity in the WSP (Strategy 1, Action Step 1.1). A CU is defined as a group of wild salmon sufficiently isolated from other groups that, if lost, are very unlikely to recolonize naturally within an acceptable timeframe (e.g. a human lifetime or a specified number of salmon generations) (DFO 2005).\nConservation Units are delineated by their salmon ecology, life-history, and genetics:\n•\n•\n•\nEcologies, specifically, ecological adaptive zones, are contiguous habitats that share common environmental and biological traits that shape the salmon adaptive environment. A Freshwater Adaptive Zone (FAZ) groups similar and contiguous freshwater habitats together based on their connectivity, climate, gradient, and hydrological characteristics. Marine Adaptive Zones (MAZ) groups similar and contiguous areas in the ocean that include coastal discontinuities within fjords, straits, and areas with distinct production processes, such as areas of upwelling and downwelling. The intersection of FAZ and MAZ are Joint Adaptive Zones (JAZ), which capture the full adaptive environment of Pacific salmon across their entire life-history. All salmon populations that fall within a JAZ are considered a potential CU, with the exception of sockeye that have a juvenile lake-rearing stage. This means that (in general) each JAZ contains at least one CU. These FAZ, MAZ and JAZ are all mapped geographically in BC/Yukon and Northeast Pacific Ocean.\nThe next step in the process of delineating CUs is the refinement of geographic boundaries on a species-by-species basis based on the life history variation and genetics of each population.\nLife histories are phenotypic characteristics of salmon. Specific characteristics that further delineate CUs include adult-spawning run timing; coast versus interior spawners; and age of maturity. Sockeye are grouped into lake- versus river-type life histories. Lake-type are populations that rear in lakes for one to two years following their emergence from their spawning gravel; river-type are those that do not rear in freshwater, but shortly after they emerge from their spawning gravel they migrate downstream to the ocean, respectively. For lake-type sockeye, each lake or connected lake group can comprise a single CU. Therefore, sockeye have the largest number of CUs in BC and the Yukon, relative to Chinook, coho, chum and coho.\n• CUs identified through their JAZ are further refined through the genetic structure of salmon species. In situations where the genetic analyses suggested significant population structure within a JAZ, life-history traits were examined to determine if the genetic structure corresponded to ecological patterns to further refine CUs.\n90\n\fBased on these considerations, there are 377 current CUs defined across the five species of salmon managed by DFO in the Pacific Region (Wade et al. 2019). Current is a specific CU designation. Current CUs are extant (i.e. not extirpated), and are either part of the original CU list developed by Holtby and Ciruna (2007), or have been modified and approved by CU experts and methodological processes that align with Holtby and Ciruna (2007). Revisions to the original CU list have been completed for Fraser sockeye and Southern BC Chinook (Grant et al. 2011; Brown et al. 2019). To ensure regional consistency in CU delineations and CU data sets, revisions to the CU list now must now be submitted to DFO Pacific Science’s Data Management Unit for approval (Wade et al. 2019; Accessed June 1 2022: https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/c48669a3-045b-400d-b730- 48aafe8c5ee6/resource/bb3f949c-7f6d-4992-baf8-ec1c4d8c33ba).\nA.3 WSP ACTION STEP 1.2: DEVELOP CRITERIA TO ASSESS CUS AND IDENTIFY BENCHMARKS TO REPRESENT BIOLOGICAL STATUS\nDFO’s WSP provides a framework for status assessments in its Strategy 1, Action Step 1.2. This includes a description of three status zones ranging from Red (poor status), to Amber (intermediate status), and Green (good status) (Figure 1; Table 1), and provides general methods for assessing a CU’s status.\nMore detailed work was subsequently conducted to provide a CU status assessment toolkit (Holt 2009, 2010; Holt et al. 2009). To assess CU statuses, four classes of indicators were presented including abundance, trends in abundance, fishing mortality, and distribution (Figure 2).\nTo assess a CU’s status, metrics are selected and applied depending on the availability of data and other information specific to each CU. Metric values are calculated and compared to the specific metric benchmarks to determine metric statuses (Red, Amber, or Green). For each metric, lower and upper benchmark values delineate, respectively, the Red to Amber and the Amber to Green WSP biological status zones (Figure 2).\nDetails on the metrics applied in the four completed WSP status assessments, and used in this analysis (Section 2.2.2).\nA.4 WSP ACTION STEP 1.3: MONITOR AND ASSESS CU STATUS\nStrategy 1 Action Step 1.3 is to monitor and assess statuses of CUs. The status assessment toolkit (Figure 2; Holt et al. 2009; Holt 2009; Holt 2010) was first applied to assess the statuses of Fraser sockeye CUs (Grant et al. 2011). This included identifying the appropriate metrics to use for these CUs, and also required considerable work to select and gap fill data for analyses. However, application of the metric toolkit did not result in completed status assessments for Fraser sockeye CUs, but instead flagged the need for subsequent work. Specifically, there were many Fraser sockeye CUs where statuses differed across individual metrics. For example, a CU’s percent change (recent three generation) trend metric might indicate a Red status, while the long-term trend metric (comparing recent generation escapement average to long term average) might indicate a Green status. Given the different statuses that can be present across individual metrics for a single CU, simply applying the\n91\n\fmetric toolkit does not always produce sufficient advice on CU status. Therefore, an integration process that combines statuses across metrics into a single status was identified as a necessary next step, and was developed and implemented for Fraser sockeye CUs (Figure 2; Grant & Pestal, 2012).\nWSP integrated statuses for the 24 Fraser sockeye CUs were produced through a Delphi- approach. This process used expert judgement from a group of salmon population specialists to combine status information across CU metrics, supplemented with additional information on CU productivity, abundance, and exploitation over time (Figure 3).\nA key step for this status integration process is producing standardized data summaries for each CU, with status and other information to be used by the salmon experts to develop integrated statuses (Grant & Pestal 2012). These data summaries were essential for consistency, because they allowed all participants to work through the same quality- controlled information, rather than working off memory or different versions of data sets held by various individuals (reprinted in Appendix B).\nThe expert-driven process took three days and ~40 participants to produce statuses for 24 CUs, accompanied by narratives describing which information drove each status determination. Through this process, two additional status zones that fall between the original Red, Amber, and Amber zones were identified, these being Red/Amber, and Amber/Green statuses (Figure 3).\nThe WSP integrated status assessment approach, which includes applying the toolkit and integrating information to produce integrated statuses, was subsequently adapted and applied to Interior Fraser coho (DFO, 2015) and southern BC Chinook (DFO, 2016). This required considerable additional work in the data preparation stages for both of these groups of CUs to separate hatchery from wild populations prior to assessment. The status integration process for Southern BC Chinook was similarly laborious and time-intensive (e.g. Figure 4) as the first Fraser sockeye assessment, given the large number of CUs that were assessed. Interior Fraser coho was a shorter process (~25 people and 1 day), as there are only five CUs in this group.\nTeams comprised of 4-6 individuals developed integrated status assessments for each CU, and then in plenary sessions, consensus on the final statuses were determined as an entire group. It is important to emphasize that there were different designations of status that varied among individuals in groups, and also between groups (Figure 3, Figure 4). Generally data that were absolute abundance and could be compared to existing relative-abundance benchmarks, provided more consistent assessments among participants. This was particularly the case when statuses were consistent across the probability levels of the estimated benchmarks; for example, Red statuses from the 10% to 90% probability level of the benchmarks, were likely to result in more consistent assignment of Red status among individuals and groups (Grant & Pestal 2012). Data that were indices of abundances only, where only trend metrics could be evaluated, led to more inconsistencies in status assignments among individuals and groups. This is also particularly the case when statuses differed between metrics.\nThe time investment to produce detailed WSP status assessments is significant, requiring the participation of 10-40 Pacific salmon experts for up to three days in a workshop setting. Further, after the workshops have been completed, the final status results proceed through CSAS peer-review processes, which require another set of formal meetings covering one or more days and 20-40 participants. In addition, effort is required to prepare data, calculate metric statuses, produce data summaries, organize workshops, and write and edit CSAS research documents. The resulting processes take years to complete, and for Interior Fraser 92\n\fcoho, and Southern BC Chinook, CSAS research documents have yet to be published, to supplement the short CSAS Science Advisory Reports (DFO 2015; DFO 2016).\nTo re-assess the status of previously assessed CUs, a stream-lined status assessment process was developed and implemented for Fraser sockeye (Grant et al. 2020). The data summary packages were updated with more recent data to capture changes since the previous assessment. Data summaries were then run through a status integration process that involved only 10 Fraser sockeye experts over one day. However, even the stream-lined process took considerable work to prepare for and implement, and as a result, no re- assessments have occurred for Interior Fraser coho or Southern BC Chinook, and no further Fraser sockeye status re-assessments have occurred. Status assessments have not been completed, or even attempted for other species or areas.\nAll previous detailed WSP status assessment publications flagged the need for rapid annual status assessments, and guidelines on how often detailed reassessments should be required (DFO 2012; Grant & Pestal 2012; DFO 2015; DFO 2016). In the first Fraser sockeye WSP status process, a number of CUs were assigned provisional statuses, where it was recommended they be assessed regularly given concerns about their declining trends and anticipated rapid deterioration in status. The Interior coho process also recommended annual monitoring and status reassessment of CUs where there are signs of productivity and spawner abundance changes (DFO 2015). It was noted for this CU group that status metric values varied considerably over short time periods. For similar reasons, the Southern BC Chinook process also recommended annual assessments of status across individual metrics, the development of guidelines to integrate statuses across metrics, and more streamlined rapid assessment approaches going forward (DFO 2016).\nThe need for streamlined, rapid status assessments is particularly strong now, given the rapid declines being observed in salmon abundances and productivity, and the accelerating global climate change that is occurring (Bush and Lemmen 2019; Grant et al. 2019; Irvine et al. 2019; Crozier et al. 2019, 2021). Pacific salmon status assessments are likely to become rapidly out of date if not assessed frequently with these shifting conditions. The current inability to provide up-to-date CU statuses, and monitor statuses over time remains a key gap in implementing the WSP, specifically Strategy 1 Action Step 1.3: Monitor and Assess CU status.\nDetailed WSP status processes continue to have merit in terms of fine-tuning data treatment, selecting metrics and estimating up-to-date benchmarks that may include time-varying productivity and/or changes to carrying capacity. Rapid status results can be used to flag and prioritize where more detailed integrated status assessments might be required to improve the rapid status algorithm going forward.\nA.5 WSP VERSUS COSEWIC STATUS ASSESSMENTS\nThere are substantial similarities and some key differences between status assessments generated through DFO’s WSP versus the COSEWIC. Similarities between WSP status assessments and COSEWIC include:\n• WSP integrated status assessment methods were developed using COSEWIC\ncriteria, which were based on IUCN status criteria, as a starting point;\n•\nBoth approaches rely on percent change and absolute abundance metrics, which are COSEWIC criteria that are also informally used for WSP status metrics;\n93\n\f• Recent COSEWIC assessments of Pacific salmon relied on the detailed WSP status materials (assembled data, WSP statuses, CU narratives) as the starting point for their assessments.\nSpecific differences between WSP and COSEWIC metrics used to assess stat (us include:\n• The WSP percent change metric has a slightly more conservative lower benchmark of\na 25% decline in abundance, compared to the COSEWIC benchmark at 30% decline (Holt et al. 2000; Grant et al. 2011).\n• COSEWIC does not use a relative-abundance metric, despite its importance to the WSP status process. This is largely attributed to the fact that COSEWIC criteria are generic, designed to be applicable across a broad range of Canadian plant and animal species, while DFO’s WSP status assessments are specifically designed for the nuances of Pacific Salmon, adapting existing COSEWIC and IUCN methods for this purpose. However, when relative-abundance benchmarks based on stock- recruitment data are not available for CUs, then the DFO and COSEWIC status assessment processes rely on similar metrics: abundance trends and absolute abundances if available.\nAlthough COSEWIC includes a broad range of plant and animal species experts to assess status, they rely on core information provided by species experts. This contributed to results that are comparable between COSEWIC and DFO WSP status assessments, despite differences in their status assessment approaches.\nThe status assessment reports written by COSEWIC relied on data and information managed by DFO, collated from stock assessment projects by DFO, Indigenous groups and others. They also relied on DFO WSP CU designations, and status assessment results produced prior to the COSEWIC status process using identical data sets (Grant et al. 2011, 2020; Grant and Pestal 2012; DFO 2015, 2016).\nThere are slight differences in COSEWIC’s definition of DUs, compared to DFO’s WSP CUs, though COSEWIC largely relied on DFO’s detailed CU methods (Holtby & Ciruna 2007) and results to identify DUs (Brown et al. 2019; Grant et al., 2011). Therefore the DU versus CU lists are identical for Fraser sockeye, and Interior Fraser coho, and have slight differences for a few Southern BC Chinook CUs.\nThere is also much overlap between COSEWIC’s status assessments compared to DFO’s WSP status assessments:\n• Approximately 90% of CUs placed in the WSP Red or Red/Amber status zones aligned with COSEWIC’s poorest status zone of Endangered (DU is facing an imminent threat of extinction).\n• At the other end of the status spectrum, ~80% of CUs assessed in the WSP’s\nhealthiest status zone (Amber/Green and Green) aligned with COSEWIC’s healthiest status zone of Not at Risk.\n•\nIn 80% of cases where DFO statuses were Amber (WSP intermediate status zones), the COSEWIC statuses were Threatened or Special Concern (WSP intermediate status zones between Endangered and Not at Risk).\n• Notable differences occurred where a WSP status was more conservative, indicating a poorer status than COSEWIC (2 Red=2 Threatened; 1 Amber=1 Not at Risk). However, there was equal number of cases where WSP status was less conservative than COSEWIC (1 Green=1 Threatened; 2 Amber/Green=2 Special Concern). 94\n\fAPPENDIX B: STATUS NARRATIVE FROM INTEGRATED WSP STATUS ASSESSMENT WORKSHOPS\nB.1 FRASER SOCKEYE\nThese status narratives were extracted from two sources:\n• For the initial status assessments, with data up to 2010, we briefly summarized the\ndetailed status narratives in Appendix 2 of Grant and Pestal (2012).\n• For the 2017 reassessments, with data up to 2015, we extracted the very brief\nwording in Table 3 of the CSAS Science Advisory Report generated from the WSP status assessment (DFO 2018).\nB.1.1 Early Stuart (SEL-06-14, Red in 2010, Red in 2015) (CYCLIC)\nStock Match: Early Stuart; this is considered a cyclic CU\nThe main considerations in the initial 2010 assessment of Red were: (1) set aside the relative abundance metrics due to concerns regarding Sgen and Smsy estimates for this highly cyclic CU, (2) steep decrease identified by percent change metric (Red), (3) long-term trend was Amber, but it fell close to the lower benchmark so did not alter the Red status designation.\nThe main considerations in the 2015 reassessment of Red were: (1) All metrics were Red, and in addition productivity was declining.\nB.1.2 Chilliwack-ES\n(SEL-03-01, Red/Amber in 2010, Amber/Green\nin 2015)(CYCLIC)\nStock Match: Miscellaneous Early Summers; this is considered a cyclic CU\nThe main considerations in the initial 2010 assessment of Red/Amber were: (1) differences in integrated status determination between expert groups, and therefore, to the final mixed Red/Amber designation, was due to different interpretations of the same limited information for this CU particularly related to whether or not this CU was cyclic; (2) factors pointing to Amber designation were the Amber on the relative abundance metric if the arithmetic generational average is used and the absolute number of spawners well above the COSEWIC criterion D1 (assuming cyclic population dynamics). (3) The main factor pointing to Red designation was the Red status for the relative abundance metric using the geometric average of recent abundances; in addition, there are some recent years where abundances fall close to the COSEWIC criterion D1, when comparing all recent escapement data (assuming non-cyclic population dynamics).\nThe main considerations in the 2015 reassessment of Amber/Green were: (1) Rel Abd is Amber, (2) percent change and long-term trends are Amber, and (3) no years in the time series fell below the COSEWIC Criterion for small populations (1,000).\n95\n\fB.1.3 Pitt-ES (SEL-03-05, Amber/Green in 2010, Green in 2015)\nStock Match: Pitt\nThe main considerations in the initial 2010 assessment of Amber/Green were: (1) the mixed signals amongst metrics and status information presented in the data summaries, and the different interpretations of these mixed status signals between expert groups; (2) relative abundance metric statuses was Green at the 50% probability (median) benchmark for most models, but Amber at the adjacent higher probability level (75%); (3) systematic decreases in productivity with some recent years of productivity falling below replacement; (3) hatchery influence could be confounding the productivity time series, making productivity appear better than it actually is.\nThe main considerations in the 2015 reassessment of Green were: (1) all variations of the relative abundance metric were Green, (2) long-term trend was Green (3) percent change was Red, but has switched between Red, Amber, and Green several times over the time series, and 3 generation window included the largest abundances in the time series from the early 2000s.\nB.1.4 Nahatlatch-ES (SEL-05-02, Red in 2010, Amber in 2015)\nStock Match: Miscellaneous Early Summers\nThe main considerations in the initial 2010 assessment of Red were: (1) Red for the percent change metric, (2) some recent low years of abundance that fall below 1,000, (3) long-term trend was Amber, but very close to the lower benchmark.\nThe main considerations in the 2015 reassessment of Amber were: (1) low absolute abundance (median 2000, 1 of last 4 years &lt; 1,000), (2) long-term trend and percent change were Amber.\nB.1.5 Anderson-Seton-ES (SEL-06-01, Amber in 2010, Amber/Green\nin 2015)\nStock Match: Gates\nThe main considerations in the initial 2010 assessment of Amber were: (1) This is a cyclic CUs, so the relative abundance metric was not considered at the time, (2) overall population increase since the 1960s and 1970s, resulting in Amber for the long-term trend metric, (3) stable abundance in recent years, (4) recent declining trend, resulting in Red for the percent change metric, (5) relatively low abundance on weak cycle years; however, no recent years fall below 1,000.\nThe main considerations in the 2015 reassessment of Amber/Green were: (1) percent change and long-term trend were Green, (2) no years out of the last four fell below the COSEWIC Criterion for small populations (1,000), (3) the general declining productivity pattern for this CU contributed to lowering the status to Amber/Green, although there have been improvements in productivity since the 2012 status assessment, (4) mixed Amber/Green on the relative-abundance metric (i.e. at probability levels below 75% this metric was Amber and at probability levels above the 50% probability level this metric was Amber).\n96\n\fB.1.6 Taseko-ES (SEL-06-16, Red* in 2010, Red in 2015)\nStock Match: Miscellaneous Early Summers\nThe main considerations in the initial 2010 assessment of Red were: (1) consistently Red status for trend metric (percent change and long-term), (2) this CU does not have recruitment data, therefore, relative abundance metric statuses could not be estimated, (3) since abundance data for this CU are an index only, recent absolute abundances could not be compared to COSEWIC Criteria D1.\nOverall, the integrated status in 2010 for this CU was flagged as provisional, because data quality was rated fair; Workshop participants highlighted that escapement data, which are an index of escapement only, would require further evaluation.\nThe main considerations in the 2015 reassessment of Red were: (1) long-term trend and percent change Red, (2) no recruitment estimates available, so no benchmarks for the relative abundance metric.\nB.1.7 Nadina-Francois-ES (SEL-06-20, Red in 2010, Amber/Green in\n\n\n\nStock Match: Nadina\nThe main considerations in the initial 2010 assessment of Red were: (1) Red on the relative abundance metric status across 23 of 30 paired upper and lower benchmark combinations (probability levels and model forms); (2) systematic decreases in productivity, (3) Red on the percent change metric was discounted because the CU was returning from a periods of large abundance, particularly the year 2000. (4) long-term trend was Green, (5) a few expert groups assigned this CU a provisional Red status in the initial assessment due to concerns regarding SR model fit and resulting benchmark estimates.\nThe main considerations in the 2015 reassessment of Red were: (1) Relative abundance metrics was Amber at the median benchmark estimate, and Red above, (2) long-term and percent change trends were both Amber.\nB.1.8 Bowron-ES (SEL-07-01, Red in 2010, Red in 2015)\nStock Match: Bowron\nThe main considerations in the initial 2010 assessment of Red were: (1) all metrics were Red.\nThe main considerations in the 2015 reassessment of Red were: (1) all metrics were Red.\nB.1.9 Shuswap_ES (SEL-09-02, Amber/Green in 2010, Amber in\n2015)(CYCLIC)\nStock Match: Scotch, Seymour, Miscellaneous Early Summer. This is considered a cyclic CU.\nThe main considerations in the initial 2010 assessment of Amber/Green were: (1) relative abundance metric not considered due to concerns regarding the appropriate for cyclic CUs, (2) large and building abundances on the dominant cycle (Green long-term trend metric)\n97\n\fpointed to Green status, (3) increasing productivity in recent years pointed to Green status, (4) concerns over Red on percent change metric (5) one very recent observation of low abundance on a weak cycle that falls below the COSEWIC Criteria D1 of 1,000, and recent decreases in abundance in the off-cycle years pointed to Amber or Red status, however, most of this decreasing trend was attributed to a single weak cycle year in 2009, therefore, this decreasing trend alone was not sufficient to place this CU in a Red status zone.\nThe main considerations in the 2015 reassessment of Amber were: (1) Amber on the relative abundance metric on the dominant cycle line if cycle-specific benchmarks from the Larkin model are considered, (2) although the three other cycles are Red, they did not drive the integrated status of this CU, (3) consistently Green statuses across the long-term trend and percent change metrics.\nB.1.10 Kamloops-ES (SEL-10-01, Amber in 2010, Amber in 2015)\nStock Match: Raft, Miscellaneous Early Summer\nThe main considerations in the initial 2010 assessment of Amber were: (1) Amber on relative- abundance metric paired upper and lower benchmark combinations at the median probability levels (50%) for all models but the recursive Bayesian Ricker model; however, since this CU does not exhibit any systematic productivity trends, models that consider recent productivity (such as the recursive-Bayesian Ricker model) were not given high weight in relative- abundance metric status evaluations; (2) Green on long-term trend metric, which provides extra weight to the relative-abundance metric status, which were mostly Amber, with some Reds at higher probability levels, (3) percent change metric was Red, but down-weighted given this CU was returning from a period of high abundance and was not exhibiting any systematic trends in productivity.\nThe main considerations in the 2015 reassessment of Amber were: (1) Amber on relative abundance metric, but with high uncertainty in the benchmark estimates, (2) Green on long- term trend, (3) Red on percent change, but after coming off a period of high production in the mid-1990’s.\nB.1.11 North-Barriere-ES (SEL-10-03, Amber in 2010, Amber in 2015)\nStock Match: Fennel, Miscellaneous Early Summer\nThe main considerations in the initial 2010 assessment of Amber were: (1) Amber statuses across 29 of 30 paired upper and lower benchmark combinations (probability levels and model forms); however, the lower benchmarks were flagged as being low, ranging from 300 to 3,000, depending on model form and probability level) relative to the COSEWIC Criteria D1 values of 1,000. (2) very recent productivity appeared to be stable or increasing, (3) although percent change was Red, this metric was down-weighted given this CU was coming off a period of higher abundances, (4) Green long-term trend status, although some groups felt long-term trends should be given lower weight due to the higher exploitation rates in earlier years.\nThe main considerations in the 2015 reassessment of Amber were: (1) Amber on the relative abundance metrics, but noting that the lower benchmark (Sgen) at 1,000 was the same as the Endangered threshold used by COSEWIC, (3) Green on long-term trend metric, (3) Red on percent change metric.\n98\n\fB.1.12 Takla-Trem-S-S (SEL-06-13, Red/Amber in 2010, Red/Amber\nin 2015)(CYCLIC)\nStock Match: Late Stuart. This is considered a cyclic CU.\nThe main considerations in the initial 2010 assessment of Red/Amber were: (1) Highly cyclic, so relative abundance metric was set aside (concerns of Sgen and Smsy estimates for cyclic CUs), (2) factors pointing to Amber included large absolute abundance (no recent abundances near the COSEWIC Criteria D1 for small populations), Green long-term trend metric, and Red percent change metric (however, this CU is returning to average following a period of high abundance), (3) factors pointing to Red included decreasing productivity combined with (including a few recent years of less than 1 R/S) in combination with steep decline in percent change (although it was noted that this CU is coming off a period of high abundance, the steepness of the recent decrease in abundance was flagged as a concern).\nThe main considerations in the 2015 reassessment of Red/Amber were: (1) mixed Red and Amber on relative abundance metric across p-levels and cycle lines if the Larkin-based benchmarks are considered, (2) Red on percent change metric, (3) productivity has declined and remained low for the past 15 years (three of these years exhibited below replacement productivity), (4) continued to decline in abundance since the previous assessment (4) the dominant cycle line and one weak cycle line have decreased in abundance, and the subdominant and second weak cycle lines have respectively, remained stable and increased (5) long-term trend status is Green and has been Green for most of the retrospective metric evaluation, but this metric alone was not sufficient to bump up the integrated status from Red/Amber.\nB.1.13 Quesnel_S (SEL-06-10, Red/Amber in 2010, Red/Amber in\n2015)(CYCLIC)\nStock Match: Quesnel. This is considered a cyclic CU.\nThe main considerations in the initial 2010 assessment of Red/Amber were: (1) Highly cyclic, so relative abundance metric was set aside (concerns of Sgen and Smsy estimates for cyclic CUs), (2) decreasing productivity pointed to Red, with a several years below 1 R/S, (3) Red on percent change metric, with concerns due to a steep decline while noting that this CU was returning to average abundances after a period of high abundance, (4) large absolute abundance pointed to Amber, (5) concerns regarding the estimated productivity trends using Ricker model residuals, which may not be capturing the effects of cycle-line interactions on the productivity trends (Larkin model may be more appropriate), (6) Green on long-term trend metric but disregarded because this CU’s early time series was low after a period of human activities that significantly reduced this population’s size and the long-term time series does not provide appropriate comparison for the long-term trend metric.\nThe main considerations in the 2015 reassessment of Red/Amber were: (1) mixed statuses for the relative-abundance metric, showing Red on the dominant cycle at probability levels below 50%, and Amber above, Amber on the subdominant cycle, and Red on the two weak cycles; it appears that the dominant cycle might be shifting, with the new dominant cycle emerging on the previously subdominant cycle, (2) declines in productivity in the recent decade pointed to Red, (3) Red on percent change, (4) abundance was relatively low from 2006 to 2013 and one year in the last four falls below the COSEWIC Criterion for small populations (1,000), (5) positive signals in the slight increase in the R/ETS time series in\n99\n\frecent years, though the Larkin model residuals do not indicate a similar increase (5) Green status of the long-term trend metric (which has been Green for the entire time series).\nB.1.14 Chilko-S-ES (SEL-06-02, Green* in 2010, Green in 2015)\nStock Match: Chilko\nThe main considerations in the initial 2010 assessment of Green were: (1) relative- abundance metric Green across all benchmark probability levels and model forms, with high data quality, (2) Red on the percent change metric down-weighted, because relative and absolute abundance were large and CU returning to average abundance following a previous period of high abundance, (3) in very recent years both abundance and productivity have increased (4) Integrated Green status was flagged as provisional, given the potential status deterioration in the percent change if recent productivity (recruits/spawner) and abundance trends persist, (5) a few recent years of less than 1 R/S, but this could be linked to high spawner abundance (density dependence).\nThe main considerations in the 2015 reassessment of Green were: (1) relative-abundance metric Green across all benchmark probability levels and model forms, with high data quality, (2) Green on long-term trend, (3) productivity and percent change (Green) have improved; in the previous assessment both these trends were declining and were flagged as a risk to deteriorating status had they continued.\nNote that Chilko-ES is distinct from the Chilko-S CU (different run timing and spawning locations in the Chilko watershed), but the data for Chilko-ES currently has not been disaggregated from the larger Chilko-S CU; the Chilko-ES abundance comprises less than 10% of the combined Chilko-S & Chilko-ES aggregate. Integrated status could not be evaluated for Chilko-ES for either 2010 or 2015 given there are no independent data available. In the 2012 workshop looking at data up to 2010, participants recommended that an escapement index and proxy exploitation rate for the Chilko-ES CU be developed to provide information for subsequent status evaluations.\nB.1.15 Fran-Fras-S (SEL-06-07, Red/Amber in 2010, Amber/Green in\n\n\n\nStock Match: Stellako\nThe main considerations in the initial 2010 assessment of Red/Amber were: (1) most participants agreed on a provisional Amber integrated status designation for this CU, but due to differences both within and amongst expert groups, this CU was designated a blended Red/Amber status, (2) factors pointing to Amber included high recent abundance and Green long-term trend while down-weighting the Red percent change, because abundances for this CU are returning to average following a previous period of above-average abundance, (3) factors pointing to Red included recent declines in CU productivity, with some years falling below replacement, and Red status for the relative-abundance metric when looking at the time-varying probability model fit, and a decreasing percent change.\nThe main considerations in the 2015 reassessment of Amber/Green were: (1) mixed Amber/Green status for the relative-abundance metric, depending on probability level, (2) Green on long-term trend, and Amber on percent change.\n100\n\fB.1.16 Cultus-L (SEL-03-02, Red in 2010, Red in 2015)\nStock Match: Cultus\nThe main considerations in the initial 2010 assessment of Red were: (1) Red on relative- abundance metric across probability levels and model forms (2) Red on long-term and percent change metric, (3) recent abundance below 1,000, the COSEWIC Criterion D1 for small populations, (4) productivity trends have also decreased in recent years.\nThe main considerations in the 2015 reassessment of Red were: (1) Red on relative- abundance metric across probability levels and model forms, (2) Red long-term trend, (3) for three of the last four years and nine of the last 12 years effective female spawners fell below the COSEWIC Criterion for small populations (1,000); (4) productivity decreased in years preceding the 2000 brood year, before hatchery intervention; productivity data after 2000 could not be compared since these values are confounded by hatchery intervention; (5) percent change metric is Amber, the slightly increasing abundance is being supported by hatchery intervention (second generation hatchery enhanced fish that are unmarked); therefore, this metric is not given much weight; it is unclear whether this CU would currently be sustainable in the absence of hatchery intervention.\nB.1.17 Harrison-DS-L (SEL-03-03, Green in 2010, Amber/Green in\n\n\n\nStock Match: Miscellaneous Late\nThe main considerations in the initial 2010 assessment of Green were: (1) Green on percent change and long-term trends, (2) this CU does not have recruitment data, therefore, relative abundance metric statuses could not be estimated, (3) absolute abundance cannot be directly compared to COSEWIC Criteria for this CU since only one out of a number of creeks is being used as an indicator of this CU’s status; however, for this single creek alone (Big Silver), it does not trigger COSEWIC’s Criteria D1 in the last four years, (4) although the percent change in abundance metric was Green in status, in very recent years there has been a decrease in abundance and it was recommended that this trend be monitored, since if it persists the status of this CU could change in the near future (to Amber or Red).\nThe main considerations in the 2015 reassessment of Amber/Green were: (1) Green long- term trend, (2) Red percent change, but coming off a peak abundance, (2) relative abundance metric not available.\nB.1.18 Harrison-US-L (SEL-03-04, Amber in 2010, Red in 2015)\nStock Match: Weaver\nThe main considerations in the initial 2010 assessment of Amber were: (1) relative abundance metric mostly Amber across benchmark probability levels and model forms, (2) long-term trend was also Amber, (3) percent change was not weighted high given absolute abundance was high, (4) recommended frequent monitoring of the percent change (which was Red, because it could produce changes in other metric statuses, and therefore, integrated status, if this trend persists.\nThe main considerations in the 2015 reassessment of Red were: (1) All metrics were Red, (2) Two of last four 4 years has less than 1,000 spawners\n101\n\fB.1.19 Lillooet-Harrison-Late (SEL-04-01, Green* in 2010, Amber in\n\n\n\nStock Match: Birkenhead\nThe main considerations in the initial 2010 assessment of provisional Green were: (1) absolute abundance well above COSEWIC Criteria D1 on small populations for the entire time series, even though the time series only covers Birkenhead River, so absolute abundance for the CU is, in fact, higher than indicated by the data, (2) percent change and long-term trend are Green, (3) relative-abundance metric changed to Amber status only in recent years (4) designated a provisional Green integrated status, given the declining productivity trends\nThe main considerations in the 2015 reassessment of Amber were: (1) Rel Abd metric is Amber, (2) long-term trend metric is Green, (3) percent change is Red, (4) low productivity trend, but combined with high absolute abundance.\nB.1.20 Seton-L (SEL-06-11, Undetermined in 2010, Red in 2015)\nStock Match: Portage\nThe main considerations in the initial 2010 assessment of Undetermined were: (1) Relative abundance metrics set aside, due to concerns regarding benchmark estimates for cyclic CUs, (2) no integrated status designation could be agreed upon by workshop participants; the integrated status designated by groups included all three WSP status zones (Red, Amber, and Amber); even within groups there was inconsistency in status determinations amongst individuals:\n•\n•\ntwo groups designated this CU Red based on the steep decline in abundance and (percent change) and the decreasing productivity, two groups designated this CU Green, emphasizing that the dominant cycle did not exhibit any decreasing trend in abundance and has been quite stable since the 1980’s (after a period of rebuilding in the previous decade after the original CU was extirpated); these groups discounted the percent change and long-term trend metric in their status evaluations since they felt these metrics were strongly influenced by a single low observation on a single subdominant cycle year;\n• one group designated this CU Amber, as a middle ground to balance all the\nconsiderations presented by the Red and Amber designations described in previous bullets; although the group agreed to an Amber integrated status, interpretations varied amongst individuals in this group;\nThe main considerations in the 2015 reassessment of Red were: (1) relative abundance is Red across variations of model form and probability level, (2) Two of last four years had less than 1,000 spawners, (3) long-term trend and percent change have been Red for several years.\nB.1.21 Shuswap-L (SEL-09-03, Green in 2010, Amber/Green in 2015)\n(CYCLIC)\nStock Match: Late Shuswap. This is considered a cyclic CU.\n102\n\fThe main considerations in the initial 2010 assessment of Green were: (1) relative abundance metrics set aside, due to concerns regarding benchmark estimates for cyclic CUs, (2) long- term trend Green and generational average abundance increasing, (3) stable productivity, (4) large number of spawners on the dominant cycle year for this CU (last dom year was 5.5 million).\nThe main considerations in the 2015 reassessment of Amber/Green were: (1) Green status of the dominant cycle relative-abundance, (2) large number of spawners on the dominant cycle year for this CU (last gen avg 2.1 million), (3) productivity stable since the beginning of the time series with increase in very recent years, (4) the low abundances of the other cycle- lines, and declining trends observed for the subdominant cycle, down-weighted this CU’s status to Amber/Green, (5) though the percent change trend status is Red, this is driven by the subdominant (which are largely five year old fish from the dominant cycle) and the first (and smallest) weak cycle; the dominant cycle has not exhibited a declining trend, and in fact had exceptional returns in the last two cycle years (2010 and 2014). Since the weak cycle is not enumerated with high precision methods (visual methods applied), a sensitivity analysis of the potential error in the recent weak cycle estimate indicates that the trend metric status could range from Red to Amber, depending on the true value, (6) similarly, the long-term trend of 0.46 is Red status, but falls right on the edge of an Amber status (lower benchmark is 0.5); if the most recent weak cycle abundance were actually greater than 100 (which is within the range of error for this data point), this metric status would change to Amber;\nB.1.22 Widgeon-RT (SER-02, Red in 2010, Red in 2015)\nStock Match: Miscellaneous Late\nThe main considerations in the initial 2010 assessment of Red were: (1) low absolute abundance, falling below COSEWIC D1 for a number of recent years, (2) Red on long-term trend metric, (3) the current generational average abundance (89) is extremely small, (4) this CU does not have recruitment data, so no relative-abundance benchmarks, (5) Amber on percent change metric does provide some encouraging indications of improving trends, however, these trends were not sufficient to change this CU’s integrated status designation from Red.\nThe main considerations in the 2015 reassessment of Red were: (1) absolute abundance low, with 3 of last 4 spawner abundances less than 1,000, (2) this CU has a small spatial distribution, therefore, it CU will be consistently in the Red status zone.\nB.1.23 Harrison_R (SER-03, Green in 2010, Green in 2015)\nStock Match: Harrison\nThe main considerations in the initial 201 assessment of Green were: (1) relative abundance Green at median benchmark estimates, (2) percent change and long-term trend Green, (3) productivity has also increased over the past decade, (4) average absolute abundance in the last generation has been an order of magnitude higher than the time series average.\nThe main considerations in the 2015 reassessment of Green were: (1) relative abundance Green at median benchmark estimates, (2) percent change and long-term trend Green.\n103\n\fB.2 SOUTHERN BC CHINOOK\nThese status narratives were extracted from Tables 9 to 14 of the unpublished Working Paper generated after the expert workshop, which used data up to 2012. Note that the status assessments only apply to the CU (i.e. are based on data for wild sites, and exclude data for sites with moderate or high levels of hatchery supplementation).\nThese short narratives document the considerations identified in plenary discussion as determining the status designation. Status notes were developed during plenary discussions on Day 2 and 3, first with CU names hidden, and then revealed. The summaries reproduced here were shortened to focus on the key drivers in the deliberation, but all additional comments raised by participants were merged into the CU summary in Appendix B of the unpublished Working Paper. At almost 200 pages, the detailed notes are too long to reproduce here.\nCUs with integrated status designations are listed first, in sequence of CU ID. CUs for which no integrated status was assigned are then grouped together, summarizing the rationale provided.\nData deficient CUs were also grouped into five types, with details included for each CU below:\n• Type 1: Time series of good quality data available, but considered not representative\nof whole CU.\n• Type 2: Good quality data available, but time series too short to make inferences\nabout trends.\n• Type 3: Data available, but none meet the quality criteria • Type 4: Good quality data available, but none for sites classified as wild. • Type 5: No recent data\nB.2.1 Okanagan_1.x (CK-01, Red)\nBased on metrics (all Red) and very low relative index of abundance (peaks at 30 fish), this CU was classified as Red, but it is very likely extirpated. (CU definition should be revisited given the presence of US hatchery strays.)\nB.2.2 Lower Fraser River_FA_0.3 (CK-03, Green-provisional)\nWSP metrics for relative abundance and extent of decline are Green, and absolute abundance is substantial for Chinook. However, the short-term decline observed in recent years, despite decreasing exploitation rates, resulted in a provisional status designation to highlight the need for monitoring the trend.\nB.2.3 Lower Fraser River-Upper Pitt_SU_1.3 (CK-05, Data Deficient –\nType 1)\nBased on available data and the metrics presented, most groups assessed this CU as Red due to declining trends and low abundance. However, participants agreed to a DD assessment based on additional information provided by a participating expert (the single site\n104\n\fwith data is not representative, and surveys of additional sites within the CU are currently not feasible). Specifically, the rationale was “Time series of good quality data available, but considered not representative of whole CU. Only 1 population surveyed but others may exist that are not yet known.”\nB.2.4 Lower Fraser River SU_1.3 (CK-06, Data Deficient – Type 1)\nTime series of good quality data available but considered not representative of whole CU. Data available for only 1 site out of 7 (most abundant site cannot be assessed due to low visibility), and for the site with data, the time series is too short.\nB.2.5 Maria Slough_SU_0.3 (CK-07 – TBD)\nThe CU has received an enormous amount of stewardship and watershed restoration activity. Human land-use impacts have changed the hydrography of this geographically small CU. There is no data for wild sites in the CU.\nB.2.6 Middle Fraser-Fraser Canyon_SP_1.3 (CK-08, Data Deficient – Type 3)\nData available, but none meet the quality criteria. Only records are opportunistic observations during sockeye salmon surveys.\nB.2.7 Middle Fraser River-Portage_FA_1.3 (CK-09, Red)\nMost groups assessed this CU as Red status based on relative abundance (Red even if doubled the index spawners) and the percent change / probability of decline combination. However, there is high uncertainty due to short time series of data with quality ranking and observed lack of response to decreasing ER.\nB.2.8 Middle Fraser River_SP_1.3 (CK-10, Red)\nStrong and significant downward trend. Even if true abundance were double the estimate due to bias in relative index, it would still not exceed Sgen.\nB.2.9 Middle Fraser River_SU_1.3 (CK-11, Amber)\nAll groups assessed this CU as Amber due to mixed signals from the 3 metrics (1 Red, 1 Amber, 1 Green). Overall, the magnitude of decline is not large, not all sites are declining and the total of index spawners is well above COSEWIC Criterion D. In combination, this resulted in a down-weighting of the percent change metric (Red).\n105\n\fB.2.10 Upper Fraser River_SP_1.3 (CK-12, Red)\nRelative abundance, percent change, and probability of decline are all Red. Very small contribution of hatchery in recent years (few hundred hatchery fish among tens of thousands of spawners), moderate precision, but highly reliable aerial survey estimates. Overall, highly confident in assessment.\nB.2.11 South Thompson_SU_0.3 (CK-13, Green)\nPercent change and extent of decline show pronounced increase, and relative abundance metric should be green as well with a relatively small adjustment for likely under-estimate in relative index.\nB.2.12 South Thompson_SU_1.3 (CK-14 Red/Amber)\nParticipants settled on Red/Amber based on a show of hands after much debate within and between groups. Key considerations were: relative abundance and percent change are Red, but visual estimates are imprecise, may be biased low and fall near the confidence range for the lower benchmark, so might actually be Amber on the relative abundance metric. Also, anecdotal information was presented that 2013 had a large return (not included in the data summary) which further moved the evaluation towards Amber.\nB.2.13 South Thompson-Bessette Creek_SU_1.2 (CK-16, Red*)\nPrecipitous decline and extremely low numbers (but need to revisit CU definition). If this is accepted as a CU, then no question that the population has declined drastically.\nB.2.14 Lower Thompson_SP_1.2 (CK-17, Red)\nMost groups designated this CU as Red status based on metrics for relative abundance (Red) and percent change (Red), but 1 group leaned to Amber designation based on extent of decline (Amber) and relative abundance after rough adjustment for sites not surveyed (i.e. index spawner abundance close to lower benchmark).\nB.2.15 North Thompson_SP_1.3 (CK-18, Red)\nVery strong short-term decline and very low numbers of fish, combined with high uncertainty due to small number of data points.\nB.2.16 North Thompson_SU_1.3 (CK-19, Red)\nDespite being a relative index of abundance, the WSP benchmarks metric (Red) carried significant weight in this case because 4 out of 5 available sites are included in the data stream. Percent change (Red) and probability of decline (Red) were also strong indicators.\n106\n\fB.2.17 Southern Mainland-Georgia Strait_FA_0.x (CK-20, Data\nDeficient – Type 5)\nNo recent, high quality escapement records.\nB.2.18 East Vancouver Island-Nanaimo_SP_1.x (CK-23, Data\nDeficient – Type 5)\nVery little recent data exists. A genetic baseline review is currently ongoing to determine whether this CU still exists.\nB.2.19 Southern Mainland-Southern Fjords_FA_0.x (CK-28, Data\nDeficient – Type 2)\nNo biological benchmarks presented and available spawner time series is short. However, workshop participants highlighted that data for this CU need to be further investigated, and categorized it as “Good quality data available, but time series too short to make inferences about trends.”\nB.2.20 East Vancouver Island-North_FA_0.x (CK-29, Red)\nAll groups designated this CU as Red but this was the result of considerations other than the 3 WSP metrics. Rather, participants highlighted the following concerns: only a small portion of total abundance in wild sites, impacts of straying are likely and a very small index of abundance of wild sites.\nB.2.21 West Vancouver Island-South_FA_0.x (CK-31, Red)\nMost groups designated this CU as Red, but due mostly to pressures (straying from large- scale hatchery releases, including sea pens, and high exploitation rates (roughly 60%) rather than to abundance or observed trends. Data from 2 small populations among 21 possible wild sites is not considered to be representative. Participants recommended completion of further work to determine whether these populations still exist as a CU under WSP definition.\nB.2.22 West Vancouver Island-Nootka & Kyuquot_FA_0.x (CK-32 ,\nRed)\nMost groups designated this CU as Red, but this was the result of considerations other than the 3 WSP metrics. Rather, participants highlighted the following concerns: only a small portion of total abundance in wild sites and impacts of straying are likely, very small index of abundance of wild sites.\n107\n\fB.2.23 Homathko_SU_x.x (CK-34, Data Deficient – Type 5)\nVery little recent data exists. Regular visual surveys are not feasible on this large and turbid river.\nB.2.24 Klinaklini_SU_1.3 (CK-35, Data Deficient – Type 5)\nThere has been no data collected in recent years, and no supporting information exists to inform a status evaluation at this time. Past fishwheel surveys showed large number of Chinook (7k to 18k), but no data from recent years and not part of regular survey program.\nB.2.25 Upper Adams River_SU_x.x (CK-82, Data Deficient – Type 3)\nInitial Red/Amber status designation was based on data presented, but participants agreed to a DD status based on additional information provided by a participating expert (the site data quality was misclassified). The available spawner estimates are based on redd counts, which are difficult to assess consistently, and the CU is not routinely surveyed.\nB.2.26 Type-4 Data Deficient (Good quality data, but none for wild\nsites) – 11 CUs\nWorkshop participants initially attempted to assess the status of the enhanced units, but eventually agreed that the WSP status metrics and benchmarks cannot be applied directly and recommended further work on methods specifically for these cases.\nFor 10 of these 11 cases, the status assessment was To Be Determined (TBD), with the rationale that the CU was “Not assessed due to unresolved technical and policy aspects of evaluation approach. These CUs were, in order of ID:\n• CK-21 - East Vancouver Island-Goldstream_FA_0.x • CK-33 - West Vancouver Island-North_FA_0.x • CK-22- East Vancouver Island-Cowichan & Koksilah_FA_0.x • CK-02 - Boundary Bay_FA_0.3 • CK-07 - Maria Slough_SU_0.3 • CK-25 - East Vancouver Island-Nanaimo & Chemainus_FA_0.x • CK-15 - Shuswap River_SU_0.3 • CK-83 - East Vancouver Island-Georgia Strait_SU_0.3 • CK-27 - East Vancouver Island-Qualicum & Puntledge_FA_0.x • CK-9008 - Fraser-Harrison fall transplant_FA_0.3\nOne of these CUs, Lower Fraser River_SP_1.3 (CK-04) was flagged for a review of enhancement classification. Specifically, the rationale was: “Not assessed, given unresolved technical and policy aspects of evaluation approach. However, the classification of enhancement level needs to be reviewed because enhancement stopped in 2002 brood year and the system now has natural spawners. There are also a number of locations within this TU that have no enhancement but are not surveyed.\n108\n\fB.3 INTERIOR FRASER COHO\nThese status narratives were extracted from Table 4 in the Science Advisory Report generated from the WSP status assessment (DFO 2015).\nB.3.1 Middle Fraser Coho (Amber)\nThe main considerations in the integrated status determination were: (1) the patterns of productivity with frequent failures to achieve replacement over the most recent 13 years, (2) the low productivity and low smolt-adult survival over the last two decades, (3) the poorly described and imprecise stock-recruitment function, (4) moderate to high level of uncertainty and variability for the information presented, and (5) the current spawner abundance relative to benchmark estimates and COSEWIC reference points.\nB.3.2 Fraser Canyon Coho (Amber)\nThe main considerations in the integrated status determination were (1) the percent change was Red for all but the most recent year and there is a moderate probability that the CU is currently in the Red zone, (2) the patterns of productivity with frequent failures to achieve replacement over the most recent 13 years, (3) the low productivity and low smolt-adult survival since 1998, (4) the short time series with no information prior to 1998, (5) the abundance exceeded the COSEWIC reference points, (6) the CU has a small capacity and has low-moderate intrinsic productivity, and (7) this is a single-site CU with spawners in a short section of one river which reduces resilience to perturbations and there is no likelihood of replacement from adjacent tributaries.\nB.3.3 Lower Thompson Coho (Amber/Green)\nThe main considerations in the assignment of mixed status were (1) the percent change was increasing and there was virtually 0% probability for the Red zone, (2) the extent of decline metric showed the recent spawner abundance was above the long-term average and generally above the average level during the period of higher productivity (pre 1991), (3) the last four years exceeded the upper abundance-based benchmark, (4) the patterns of productivity with frequent failures to achieve replacement over the most recent 13 years— with 3 of the last 6 years very near replacement, (5) the low productivity and low smolt-adult survival since 1998, and (6) the steadily increasing trend in smolt production since 1995.\nB.3.4 North Thompson Coho (Amber/Green)\nThe main considerations in the integrated status determination of mixed status were (1) the percent change was increasing, (2) the extent of decline metric showed the recent two years had increased but it was in the yellow or Red zone in the eight previous years, (3) productivity was often below replacement (6 of the last 13 brood years), (4) spawner abundance exceeded the upper confidence limit for the upper benchmark over the last three years, and (5) smolt-adult survival has been low and stable since brood year 2000.\n109\n\fB.3.5 South Thompson Coho (Amber)\nThe main considerations in the integrated status determination were (1) the patterns of productivity with frequent failures to achieve replacement over the most recent 13 years, (2) the low productivity and low smolt-adult survival over the last two decades, (3) the poorly described and imprecise stock-recruitment function, (4) moderate level of uncertainty and variability with the information presented, and (5) the spawner abundance relative to benchmark estimates.\n110\n\fAPPENDIX C: DATA USABILITY, METRICS, AND\nINTEGRATED STATUS ASSESSMENTS\nThis Appendix lists the WSP metrics and integrated status assessment results from the WSP processes. It also includes a summary of which metrics are applicable for each CU. For Southern BC Chinook CUs, this data usability summary was taken from Brown et al. (2020). For Fraser sockeye and Interior Fraser coho, we applied the same approach as Brown et al. (2020), based on the data notes in the WSP status documentation. The following species and areas have been covered:\n• Fraser River Sockeye (Appendix C.1): Fraser River sockeye were formally assessed\nunder the WSP in 2011 (Grant and Pestal 2012) and re-assessed in 2016 (Grant et al. 2020). Table 13 lists data usability by CU. Table 14 and Table 15 list the status metric values used at the time, and the resulting expert assessments of integrated status.\n• Southern BC Chinook (Appendix C.2): Southern BC Chinook were formally assessed under the WSP in 2012 (DFO 2016). Table 16 and Table 17 list data usability by CU. Table 18 lists the status metric values used at the time, and the resulting expert assessments of integrated status.\n•\nInterior Fraser Coho (Appendix C.3) Interior Fraser Coho were formally assessed under the WSP in 2012 (DFO 2015). Table 19 lists data usability by CU. Table 20 lists the status metric values used at the time, and the resulting expert assessments of integrated status.\n111\n\fC.1 FRASER SOCKEYE DATA USABILITY, METRIC VALUE, AND INTEGRATED STATUS ASSESSMENT RESULTS\nTable 13: Assessment of Data Usability For WSP Metrics - Fraser Sockeye. Time series of spawner abundances were assessed using the approach by Brown et al. (2020) to determine which WSP metrics are applicable. Type identifies whether the available estimates cover the entire CU (Absolute Abundance, Abs Abd) or just a subset of the populations (Relative Index, Rel Idx). The Abd column shows whether the spawner estimates can be used to assess CU abundances (i.e. compared to an absolute benchmark like the COSEWIC threshold for small populations, or to relative benchmarks like 80% of Smsy). The Trend (Short- and Long-) columns show whether the time series has been consistent enough (e.g. survey methods, spatial coverage) to produce meaningful short-term and long-term trends. PercBM flags whether percentile-based status benchmarks are applicable for the CU, based on the criteria identified by Holt et al. (2008).\nCU\nSpecies Area Sockeye Fraser Anderson_Seton_ES Sockeye Fraser Bowron_ES Sockeye Fraser Chilko_S_ES Sockeye Fraser Chilliwack_ES Sockeye Fraser Cultus_L Sockeye Fraser Fran_Fras_S Sockeye Fraser Harrison_DS_L Sockeye Fraser Harrison_R Sockeye Fraser Harrison_US_L Sockeye Fraser Kamloops_ES Sockeye Fraser Lillooet_Harr_L Sockeye Fraser Nadina_Francois_ES Sockeye Fraser Nahatlatch_ES Sockeye Fraser North_Barriere_ES Sockeye Fraser Pitt_ES Sockeye Fraser Quesnel_S Sockeye Fraser Seton_L Sockeye Fraser Shuswap_ES Sockeye Fraser Shuswap_L Sockeye Fraser Takla_Trem_EStu Sockeye Fraser Takla_Trem_S_S Sockeye Fraser Taseko_ES Sockeye Fraser Widgeon_RT\nType Abs_Abd Abs_Abd Abs_Abd Abs_Abd Abs_Abd Abs_Abd Rel_Idx Abs_Abd Abs_Abd Abs_Abd Abs_Abd Abs_Abd Abs_Abd Abs_Abd Abs_Abd Abs_Abd Abs_Abd Abs_Abd Abs_Abd Abs_Abd Abs_Abd Rel_Idx Abs_Abd\nAbd Y Y Y Y Y Y\nY Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y\nY\nShort Trend Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y\nLong Trend Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y\nPerc BM\nY Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y\n112\n\fTable 14: Metrics and Integrated Status - Fraser Sockeye - Data Up To 2010. This table lists the metric values and resulting statuses from the first integrated status assessment of Fraser River Sockeye (Grant and Pestal 2012). Metrics have been adapted from the original formulation to a format that works more easily with the algorithm calculations (Section 2.2.3). DataType identifies whether the available estimates cover the entire CU (Absolute Abundance, Abs Abd) or just a subset of the populations (Relative Index, Rel Idx). AbsBM shows the ratio of recent abundance relative to the COSEWIC threshold of 1,000 adults. LTr is the long-term trend, expressed as the percent change of recent abundance relative to long- term average abundance (e.g. 150 means that recent abundance is 50% larger than long- term; Note that this formulation differs a bit from the other metrics, but is more consistent with the standard WSP benchmark of 50 and 75). pCh is the percent change over 3 generations, also called the percent change metric. RelLBM is the ratio of recent abundance and the lower WSP benchmark for relative abundance (Sgen). RelUBM is the ratio of recent abundance and the upper WSP benchmark for relative abundance (80% Smsy). IntStatusRaw is the integrated status assigned through the expert process, and IntStatus is the simplified integrated status used in the algorithm development and testing (i.e. where Red/Amber was changed to Red, and Amber/Green to Amber).\nLT r\nRel LBM\nRel UBM\nInt Status Raw\npCh\nInt Statu s\n-39 -31\n1.6 1.41 4.81 0.52\n0.58 9.37 0.73 0.02 1.74 NA\n-39 175 -88 28 123 -74 NA NA -69 9 115 -57 656 103 885 3388 12.81 65 223 127 3 91 54 127 168 574 89 76 59 154 22 46\n-44 -82 -68 -54 -92 -34 46 -58 -85 -88 736\n5.22 3.67\n0.14 1.34 0.37 0.01 0.38 NA 3.6 0.19 0.37 0.69 0.15\n0.53 1\nAmber Amber Red Red Green Green Red Red/Amber Red Red Red Red/Amber Green Green Green Green Amber Amber Amber Amber Green Green Red Red Red Red Amber Amber Amber/Green Amber Red/Amber Amber/Green Amber Green Green Red Red Red Red/Amber Red Red Red Red\nRed\nID\nCU\nData Type\nHarrison_R\nCultus_L Fran_Fras_S\nCU-19 Anderson_Seton_ES Abs_Abd Abs_Abd Bowron_ES CU-1 Abs_Abd CU-6 Chilko_S_ES Abs_Abd CU-17 Chilliwack_ES Abs_Abd CU-8 Abs_Abd CU-7 Rel_Idx CU-13 Harrison_DS_L Abs_Abd CU-9 Abs_Abd CU-11 Harrison_US_L Abs_Abd CU-2 Kamloops_ES CU-12 Lillooet_Harr_L Abs_Abd Nadina_Francois_ES Abs_Abd CU-3 Abs_Abd CU-14 Nahatlatch_ES Abs_Abd CU-4 Abs_Abd CU-5 Abs_Abd CU-22 Quesnel_S Abs_Abd CU-20 Shuswap_ES Abs_Abd CU-23 Shuswap_L Abs_Abd CU-18 Takla_Trem_EStu Abs_Abd CU-21 Takla_Trem_S_S Rel_Idx CU-15 Taseko_ES Abs_Abd CU-16 Widgeon_RT\nNorth_Barriere_ES Pitt_ES\nAbs Met\n5.0 2.3 365 5.8 0.3 73.3 4.4 115.3 14.4 8.5 52.9 8.8 1.7 2.7 22.0 56.8 19.6 35.8 23.1 44.5 NA 0.4\n113\n\fTable 15: Metrics and Integrated Status - Fraser Sockeye - Data Up To 2010.

Only the Learning Trees meet these two criteria.\nNote that throughout this Appendix we present three different performance metrics that are expressed as percentage values for comparison:\n• Correct cases, expressed as a % of total cases. We include this at the beginning of each section as an overall summary for easy comparison between algorithms, but it conflates the two distinct considerations captured in criteria 1 and 3.\n• Completed cases, where the algorithm could assign a rapid status, expressed as % of\ntotal cases. This is used in Criterion 3.\n• Correct cases, expressed as % of completed cases. This is used in Criterion 1.\nE.1 FITTED ALGORITHM: MINIMALIST\nOf the 65 total cases in the learning data set, the Minimalist could assign a rapid status to 64 of them (99%) and assigned the correct status to 49 of them on the 3-status scale (75%).\nCriterion 1: the Minimalist is relatively accurate, assigning 49/64 (77%) of the completed cases correctly on its 3 status scale: Red, Amber, and Green. Positive prediction errors, where algorithm statuses were better than the WSP integrated statuses, all deviated by only one status zone.\nCriterion 2: Errors are roughly balanced between predicting better (8/64: 13%) versus poorer (7/64: 11%) rapid statuses than the associated WSP integrated statuses, so the algorithm does not err on the side of being precautionary with the test cases.\nCriterion 3: It uses only trend-based metrics, so it is applicable across all data types available for Pacific salmon CUs. The Minimalist assigns rapid statuses for almost all the learning data set CUs (64/65: 98%).\nCriterion 4: It predicts the three main status zones: Red, Amber and Green, so it meets this criterion.\nCriterion 5: Thresholds estimated using CART, so does not explicitly meet this criterion.\nCriterion 6: Criteria and their sequences estimated using CART, so does not explicitly meet this criterion.\nE.2 FITTED ALGORITHM: FANCY PANTS\nOf the 65 total cases in the learning data set, Fancy Pants could assign a rapid status to 54 of\n127\n\fthem (83%) and assigned the correct status to 47 of them on the 5-status scale (72%).\nCriterion 1: The Fancy Pants algorithm is relatively accurate, assigning 47/54 (87%) completed rapid statuses correctly on its 5 status scale: Red, Red/Amber, Amber, Amber/Green and Green. Accuracy increases slightly on the 3 status scale to 49/54 (91%). Most of the 7 incorrectly assigned statuses were off by 1 status zone (50/54: 93%).\nCriterion 2: There were more errors that predicted better 12/54 (22%) than worse 4/54 (7%) rapid statuses compared to the WSP integrated status; so this algorithm is not precautionary and does not meet this criterion.\nCriterion 3: It assigns rapid statuses to a high proportion (54/65: 83%) of the learning data set CUs. This high accuracy is a product of the data we have available for testing, which is heavily weighted towards data-rich Fraser sockeye CUs. This algorithm highly depends on the availability of the absolute abundance metric to assess status. This condition limits the applicability of Fancy Pants, since absolute abundance data, required to estimate the absolute abundance metric, are not available for most CUs in the Pacific Region. For Southern BC Chinook, for example, absolute abundance data are available for only one CU. Apart from this one CU, the Fancy Pants algorithm could only produce statuses for Southern BC Chinook CUs that had a Long Term Trend metric value that was less than 79%. The remaining Southern BC Chinook CUs could not be assigned statuses. Therefore, this algorithm has limited applicability more broadly.\nCriterion 4: It predicts the all status zones: Red, Red/Amber, Amber, Amber/Green and Green, so it meets this criterion.\nCriterion 5: Thresholds estimated using CART, so does not explicitly meet this criterion.\nCriterion 6: Criteria and their sequences estimated using CART, so does not explicitly meet this criterion.\nE.3 FITTED ALGORITHM: CATEGORICAL REALIST\nOf the 65 total cases in the learning data set, Categorical Realist could assign a rapid status to 55 of them (85%) and assigned the correct status to 41 of them on the 3-status scale (63%).\nCriterion 1: The Categorical Realist algorithm is relatively accurate, assigning 41/55 (75%) rapid statuses correctly on its 3 status scale.\nCriterion 2: Only 5/55 (9%) errors predicted better statuses, and these were limited to one status zone higher than the WSP integrated statuses. This is by design, since only two status zones are assigned by the algorithm. More predicted statuses were worse than the WSP integrated statuses (9/55: 16%), which is precautionary, meeting this criterion.\nCriterion 3: It assigns rapid statuses to a high proportion (55/65: 85%) of the learning data set CUs. Therefore this algorithm has broad applicability across Cus.\nCriterion 4: Categorical Realist only predicts Amber and Red status zones, so does not meet this criterion.\nCriterion 5: Thresholds estimated using CART, so does not explicitly meet this criterion.\nCriterion 6: Criteria and their sequences estimated using CART, so does not explicitly meet this criterion.\n128\n\fE.4 CONSTRUCTED ALGORITHM: SIMPLY RED\nOf the 65 total cases in the learning data set, Categorical Realist could assign a rapid status to 55 of them (85%) and assigned the correct status to 47 of them on the 2-status scale (72%).\nCriterion 1: Simply Red is relatively accurate, assigning 47/55 (85%) rapid status correctly on its 2 status scale: Red and NotRed. When results from this algorithm are compared on the 3 status scale, the number correct drops by half: 26/55 (47%).\nCriterion 2: There were more errors on the 2-status scale that predict poorer status than errors that predict better status than the integrated assessment (2 predicted better, out of 8 errors). Even on the 3 status scale most of the errors on are only +1 or -1, indicating that Simply Red assigned a NotRed status to cases with a WSP integrated status of either Amber or Green, which is essentially correct but is scored as an error on the 3-status scale..\nCriterion 3: It assigns rapid statuses for 55/65 (85%) of the learning data set CUs. This algorithm is limited by its reliance on the relative abundance metric to get to a NotRed status. This reliance means that the algorithm is not as applicable as others across the range of data types present.\nCriterion 4: This algorithm assigns only Red and NotRed statuses, therefore, does not meet this criterion.\nCriterion 5: Built from components of fitted trees. Thresholds estimated using CART, so does not explicitly meet this criterion.\nCriterion 6: Built from components of fitted trees. Criteria and their sequences estimated using CART, so does not explicitly meet this criterion.\nE.5 CONSTRUCTED ALGORITHMS: LEARNING TREES 1 & 2\nDifferences in rapid statuses assigned by Learning Tree 1 versus Learning Tree 2 are generally the result of the precautionary nature of the metric thresholds in Learning Tree 1. Specifically, this rapid status algorithm’s thresholds are more biologically conservative than the WSP benchmarks used to delineate metric status zones, with the exception of the percent change threshold. The percent change tree node in Learning Tree 1 has a less biologically conservative threshold than the associated WSP benchmark and is responsible for the poorer performance of this algorithm on Criterion 2 compared to Learning Tree 2.\nLearning Tree 1\nOf the 65 total cases in the learning data set, Learning Tree 1 could assign a rapid status to 65 of them (100%) and assigned the correct status to 46 of them on the 3-status scale (71%).\nCriterion 1: Learning Tree 1 correctly assigns rapid statuses for 46/65 (71%) cases.\nCriterion 2: Of the assessed cases, 17/65 (26%) were assigned a better rapid status than the WSP integrated status. Hence, this algorithm produces less precautionary status results, and therefore, does not perform well on Criterion 2.\nCriterion 3: This algorithm assigns rapid statuses for 65/65 (100%) cases in the learning data set CUs.\n129\n\fCriterion 4: It predicts the three main status zones: Red, Amber and Green; meets this.\nCriterion 5: Constructed based on review of thresholds from the fitted trees, to ensure that this criterion is met.\nCriterion 6: Constructed based on review of criteria and sequence from the fitted trees in combination with the status narratives from the expert workshops to ensure that this criterion is met.\nLearning Tree 2\nOf the 65 total cases in the learning data set, Learning Tree 1 could assign a rapid status to 65 of them (100%) and assigned the correct status to 48 of them on the 3-status scale (74%). Criterion 1: Learning Tree 2 correctly assigns rapid statuses for 48/65 (74%) cases, improving slightly on the Learning Tree 1 in terms of accuracy. Criterion 2: Similar to Learning Tree 1, this algorithm assigned a better statuses to 16/65 (25%) cases, compared to their WSP integrated statuses. Hence, this algorithm produces less precautionary status results, and therefore, does not perform well on Criterion 2. Criterion 3: This algorithm assign rapid statuses for 65/65 (100%) cases in the learning data set CUs. Criterion 4: It predicts the three main status zones: Red, Amber and Green, so it meets this criterion. Criterion 5: Constructed based on review of thresholds from the fitted trees, to ensure that this criterion is met. Criterion 6: Constructed based on review of criteria and sequence from the fitted trees in combination with tatus narratives from expert workshops to ensure that this criterion is met.\nE.6 CONSTRUCTED ALGORITHM: LEARNING TREE 3\nOf the 65 total cases in the learning data set, Learning Tree 1 could assign a rapid status to 65 of them (100%) and assigned the correct status to 54 of them on the 3-status scale (83%). Criterion 1: Learning Tree 3 correctly assigns rapid statuses for 54/65 (83%) cases. This is the highest overall number of accurate rapid status assignments across all candidate algorithms. Therefore, Learning Tree 3 improves upon Learning Trees 1 and 2 in terms of accuracy. Criterion 2: Of the incorrect statuses, only 7/65 (11%) cases were better than the WSP integrated statuses. Hence, this tree improves upon Learning Trees 1 and 2 in terms of adherence to the precautionary approach. Criterion 3: It assigns rapid statuses for 65/65 (100%) cases in the learning data set CUs. Criterion 4: It predicts the three main status zones: Red, Amber and Green, so it meets this criterion. Criterion 5: Constructed based on review of thresholds from the fitted trees, to ensure that this criterion is met. Criterion 6: Constructed based on review of criteria and sequence from the fitted trees in combination with the status narratives from the expert workshops to ensure that this criterion is met. Learning Tree 3 also was the most robust of the three Learning Tree variations in the relative abundance metric sensitivity test (Section 3.2.5).\n130\n\fAPPENDIX F: DETAILED RESULTS FOR LEARNING DATA SET\nAlgorithm performance is assessed by comparing the WSP rapid status to WSP integrated statuses, analogous to evaluating regression fits based on magnitude and pattern of residuals.\nTable 7 to Table 10 compare error distributions across candidate algorithms. This appendix includes more detailed error diagnostics for each algorithm, summarized in three different ways:\n• Confusion Matrix: A cross-tabulation of integrated statuses against rapid statuses\nassigned by the algorithm, for all cases in the Learning Set.\n• Error Type Frequency: Number and percentage of different error types (e.g. predicted status better than integrated status, predicted status worse than integrated status). Values are shown for all cases combined, and by species.\n• Error Score Frequency: Similar to the Error Type Frequency, but based on converting statuses to numeric equivalents (1 = Red, 5 = Green). Values are shown for all cases combined, and by species.\nNote that the error diagnostics in this Appendix use the most appropriate status scale for each algorithm:\n• 3-status scale (Red, Amber, Green): Minimalist, Categorical Realist, Learning Tree 1-\n3\n• 5-status scale (Red, Red/Amber, Amber, Amber/Green, Green): Fancy Pants\n• 2 status scale (Red, NotRed): Simply Red\nF.1 ERROR DIAGNOSTICS - MINIMALIST\nTable 28: Minimalist – Confusion Matrix.

Table shows four types of error. NA errors are cases where a rapid status could not be assigned with the algorithm. None is the number of cases without error, where the rapid status matches the integrated status. PredBetter is the number of cases where the rapid status is a better status than the integrated status. PredWorse is the number of cases where the rapid status is a poorer status than the integrated status.

All seven fitted and constructed algorithms could assign a rapid status to the 492 cases that had all six status metrics. However, there are pronounced differences in completion rate between algorithms (Table G.2).\nLearning Trees 1,2 and 3 could assign a rapid status to all 639 cases that had four or more of the six standard WSP metrics, and 99%-100% of the cases with 2 metrics. Learning Tree 3 could assign status to all 822 cases with two or more of the six standard metrics, for an overall completion rate of 74%. All other algorithms had low or 0% completion rate for some cases with two to five metrics (e.g. Minimalist, Fancy Pants, and Simply Red could not assign a status for any of the 32 cases with five metrics). The Minimalist and Learning Tree 3 algorithms are the only ones that could assign status to all 183 cases with two metrics, but Categorical Realist and the first two Learning Tree variations could also assign a status for most of these data-limited cases. Learning Tree 3 was able to classify all of the cases with 2 or more metrics.\nWe are still exploring alternative approaches for summarizing retrospective patterns in algorithm performance. One approach is to compare everything to one preferred or benchmark algorithm.\nWe used Learning Tree 3 as the benchmark, because it outperformed the other candidate algorithms in terms of percent completed and percent correct in the Learning Data Set.\nTable G.3 is a nested version of the standard confusion matrices in Appendix F, comparing the five other algorithms to Learning Tree 3. For cases where Learning Tree 3 assigned Red status, most of the other algorithms also assigned Red, with the exception of the CategoricalRealist. For cases where Learning Tree 3 assigned Amber, four other algorithms also mostly assigned Amber (CatReal,Minimalist, LearningTree1, LearningTree2), while FancyPants statuses were evenly split across status categories from Green to Red.\n139\n\fTable 49: Summary of Retrospective Test-Completion Rate by number of metrics and number of algorithms. There are 860 individual cases where a WSP rapid status could be assigned across CUs and years by one or more of the seven candidate algorithms. For these CUs and years, values could be estimated for one or more metrics. As a reminder, the metrics include: long-term trend, percent change, relative abundance, and absolute abundance. Perhaps obvious, but if no metric values could be estimated for a year and CU, no algorithm could assign a WSP status; this occurred for 316 cases. Conversely, if all four metric values could be estimated for a year and CU, then all seven algorithms could assign statuses; this occurred for 509 cases. For number of metrics from 1 to 3, varying numbers of algorithms could assign status.\nNumber of Algorithms\nNumber of Metrics\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n0\n316\n9\n2\n0\n0\nTotal\n327\n1\n0\n8\n0\n0\n0\n8\n3\n0\n8\n3\n0\n0\n4\n0\n0\n91\n75\n0\n11\n166\n5\n0\n0\n73\n6\n0\n79\n6\n0\n1\n2\n25\n0\n28\n7\n0\n4\n55\n0\n509\n568\n140\n\fTable 50: Summary of Retrospective Test - Completion Rate by Algorithm.

It shows how these cases are distributed across each of the seven algorithms as a percentage. For example, when number of metrics is two, there are 226 cases. Minimalist could assign a rapid status to 58% of them, while Fancy Pants could assign rapid status to only 25% of them, and Learning Tree 3 could assign rapid status to 99% of them.\nNumber\nPercentage\nMetrics Cases\nMini- malist\nFancy Pants\nCat Real\nSimply Red\nLTree1 LTree2 LTree3\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n316\n30\n226\n106\n509\nTotal number\n1187\n0\n17\n58\n69\n100\n61\n0\n0\n17\n43\n25\n29\n97\n31\n0\n17\n26\n24\n0\n43\n98\n0\n40\n98\n0\n43\n99\n100\n100\n100\n100\n100\n100\n100\n100\n100\n51\n65\n50\n72\n72\n72\n141\n\fTable 51: Summary of Retrospective Test - Comparing Learning Tree 3 to other Algorithms.

These assessments covered 47 CUs from three species of salmon.

The rapid statuses can also change over time as the CU abundance changes and the WSP metrics change accordingly. The retrospective test showed that patterns differ between CUs, so this appendix includes the detailed retrospective results. For each CU, it shows the pattern of abundance and the corresponding pattern in rapid status, and any integrated statuses that have been completed. Results are grouped by species and area or timing group. We included a brief summary of observed patterns at the beginning of each section:\n•\nInterior Fraser Coho (Appendix H.2)\n• Fraser Sockeye - Early Stuart (Appendix H.3)\n• Fraser Sockeye - Early Summer (Appendix H.4)\n• Fraser Sockeye - Summer (Appendix H.5)\n• Fraser Sockeye - Late (Appendix H.6)\n• Fraser Sockeye - River-Type (Appendix H.7)\n• Southern BC Chinook – Fraser - Lower (Appendix H.8)\n• Southern BC Chinook – Fraser - Upper (Appendix H.9)\n• Southern BC Chinook – Fraser - Thompson (Appendix H.10)\n• Southern BC Chinook - Inner South Coast (Appendix H.11)\n• Southern BC Chinook - West Coast Vancouver Island (Appendix H.12)\n145\n\fH.2 INTERIOR FRASER COHO\nFull integrated status assessments of Interior Fraser coho were completed in 2015 (DFO 2015), using spawner data up to 2013. Available spawner estimates were reviewed back to 1998 for the integrated assessment, and the retrospective test of rapid status algorithms also excluded earlier data. The integrated assessment and retrospective test cover 5 CUs:\n• Fraser Canyon (Figure 32): The integrated status assessment for 2013 was Amber. Five of the seven algorithms generate rapid statuses that are consistent with the integrated assessment for 2013 (4 Amber, 1 NotRed). Four of the seven algorithms could assign a rapid status back to 2000 and give stable statuses for 2000-2014. Six of the seven algorithms flag a deteriorating status for a few years starting in 2015, 2 years after the integrated assessment. For data up to 2013, Learning Tree 3 assigns Amber and matches the integrated assessment.\n• Middle Fraser (Figure 33): The integrated status assessment for 2013 was Amber. Five of the seven algorithms generate rapid statuses that are consistent with the integrated assessment for 2013 (4 Amber, 1 NotRed). Four of the seven algorithms could assign rapid statuses back to 1998, and most give stable statuses for long periods of time. Two of the algorithms flag a poorer status for 2006 to 2010. Six of the seven algorithms indicate a stable status since the integrated assessment was completed. For data up to 2013, Learning Tree 3 assigns Amber and matches the integrated assessment.\n• Lower Thompson (Figure 34): The integrated status assessment for 2013 was Amber/Green. Four of the seven algorithms generate rapid statuses that are consistent with the integrated assessment for 2013 (2 Amber, 1 Amber/Green, 1 NotRed). All seven algorithms could assign rapid statuses back to 2000, and most give stable statuses for long periods of time. Two of the seven algorithms flag a poorer status for earlier in the time series (up to 2007/2008). Five of the seven algorithms indicate a stable status since the integrated assessment was completed, but two algorithms indicate a deteriorating status (from Green or Amber/Green to Amber). For data up to 2013, Learning Tree 3 assigns Amber and almost matches the integrated assessment of Amber/Green.\n• South Thompson (Figure 35): The integrated status assessment for 2013 was Amber. Four of the seven algorithms generate rapid statuses that are consistent with the integrated assessment for 2013 (4 Amber, 1 NotRed). All seven algorithms could assign rapid statuses back to 2000. Only two of the seven algorithms indicate a stable status since the integrated assessment was completed. For data up to 2013, Learning Tree 3 assigns Amber and matches the integrated assessment.\n• North Thompson (Figure 36): The integrated status assessment for 2013 was Amber/Green. Four of the seven algorithms generate rapid statuses that are consistent with the integrated assessment for 2013 (2 Amber, 1 Amber/Green, 1 NotRed). All seven algorithms could assign rapid statuses back to 2000. Three of the seven algorithms indicate a stable status since the integrated assessment was completed. Four algorithms indicate a deteriorating status (from Amber or Amber/Green to Red) for 2015 to 2017. For data up to 2013, Learning Tree 3 assigns Green and almost matches the integrated assessment of Amber/Green.\n146\n\fFigure 32. Retrospective test of rapid status - Coho - Fraser Canyon.

The integrated assessment and retrospective test covers 1 CU in the Early Stuart Sockeye management unit:\n• Takla-Trembleur-EStu (Figure 37): The integrated status assessment was Red with data up to 2010 and Red with data up to 2015. All seven algorithms could assign statuses for every year since 1995. Six of the seven algorithms assigned Green or NotRed status at the beginning of the retrospective test (1995,1996), then indicated worsening status throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s, and then turned to Red around 2005. One algorithm (Categorical realist) assigned Amber status for the whole time series of the retrospective test. All algorithms indicate that status has not changed since the last integrated assessment using data up to 2015. For data up to 2010 and up to 2015, Learning Tree 3 assigns Red and matches the integrated assessments.\n152\n\fFigure 37. Retrospective test of rapid status - Fraser Sockeye - Takla_Trembleur_Early Stuart. Figure shows annual rapid statuses assigned by seven alternative candidate algorithms, as well as completed integrated status assessments. Note that integrated status assessments are mapped onto the year of data used, not the year the WSP status assessment was done. Statuses are denoted as R = Red, RA = Red/Amber, A = Amber, AG = Amber/Green, G = Green, NR = NotRed, DD = Data Deficient, and UD = Undetermined. For comparison, integrated statuses are shown as the original status assignment from the expert workshops (IntStatusOrig), as well as the conversions to the 3-status (Red/Amber/Green) and 2-status scales (Red/NotRed).\n153\n\fH.4 FRASER SOCKEYE – EARLY SUMMER\nFull integrated status assessments of Early Summer sockeye were completed in 2011 (Grant and Pestal 2012) , using spawner data up to 2010, and in 2017 (Grant et al. 2020), using spawner data up to 2015. The integrated assessment and retrospective test covers 10 CUs in the Early Summer Sockeye management unit:\n• Anderson-Seton-ES (Figure 38): The integrated status assessment was Amber with\ndata up to 2010 and Amber/Green with data up to 2015. All seven algorithms could assign statuses for every year since 1995. All seven algorithms assigned either Amber, Green, Amber/Green or NotRed status to all years except 2009. 4 algorithms picked up a decline in status in 2009, but shifted back up to the previous status the next year, or shortly after. All algorithms indicate that status has not changed since the last integrated assessment using data up to 2015. For data up to 2010, Learning Tree 3 assigns Amber and matches the integrated assessment. For data up to 2015, Learning Tree 3 assigns Amber and almost matches integrated status: Amber/Green.\n• Bowron-ES (Figure 39): The integrated status assessment was Red with data up to\n2010 and Red with data up to 2015. All seven algorithms could assign statuses for every year since 1995. Six of the seven algorithms assigned Red status to all years since the early 2000s, the seventh assigned Amber. All algorithms indicate that status has not changed since the last integrated assessment using data up to 2015. For data up to 2010 and up to 2015, Learning Tree 3 assigns Red matching integrated status.\n• Chilliwack-ES (Figure 40): The integrated status assessment was Red/Amber with\ndata up to 2010 and Amber/Green with data up to 2015. Four of the seven algorithms could assign statuses for every year since 2004. All seven algorithms could assign a status starting 2018. The three versions of the Learning Tree algorithm give identical statuses for every year. All three indicate that status was poorer from 2005-2011, then improved to Amber from 2012-2017, and shifted back to Red since 2018. For data up to 2010 and up to 2015, Learning Tree 3 assigns Red and matches the integrated assessments. For data up to 2010, Learning Tree 3 assigns Red and almost matches the integrated assessment of Red/Amber. For data up to 2015, Learning Tree 3 assigns Amber and almost matches the integrated assessment of Amber/Green.\n• Kamloops-ES (Figure 41): The integrated status assessment was Amber with data up to 2010 and Amber with data up to 2015. All seven algorithms could assign statuses for every year since 1995. Five of the seven algorithms picked up an improvement in status around the early 2000s. All seven algorithms assigned either Amber or NotRed status to all years from 2010 to 2018. Five of the seven algorithms indicate that status has worsened to Red since the last integrated assessment of Amber using data up to 2015. For data up to 2010 and up to 2015, Learning Tree 3 assigns Amber and matches the integrated assessments.\n• Nadina/Francois-ES (Figure 42): The integrated status assessment was Red with data up to 2010 and Amber/Green with data up to 2015. All seven algorithms could assign statuses for every year since 1995. All seven algorithms indicated consistent status from 1995 to 2014, but five of the algorithms produced changing annual statuses since 2015, switching between Red and either Amber or NotRed. Those five algorithms indicate that status improved in 2015 (which matches the integrated assessment), then worsened in 2017, and improved again to the previous Amber or NotRed since 2018. For data up to 2010, Learning Tree 3 assigns Red and matches the integrated assessment. For data up to 2015, Learning Tree 3 assigns Amber and\n154\n\falmost matches the integrated assessment of Amber/Green.\n• Nahatlatch-ES (Figure 43): The integrated status assessment was Red with data up to 2010 and Amber with data up to 2015. Four of the seven algorithms could assign statuses for every year since 1995. Two additional algorithms could assign status for some years where the resulting status was Red. Four other algorithms also assigned Red status for those years. One algorithm, Categorical Realist could not assign status for any year. Algorithms that assigned statuses for all years generated Amber or Green statuses for 1995 to 2007, Red from 2008 to 2012 (matching the integrated expert assessment). From 2013 to 2018, all completed statuses point to an improvement (Amber or Green from the algorithms, Amber from the expert workshop), but all 6 completed statuses turned Red in 2019, indicating that status has worsened since the last WSP workshop. For data up to 2010, Learning Tree 3 assigns Red and matches the integrated assessment. For data up to 2015, Learning Tree 3 assigns Amber and matches the integrated assessment.\n• North Barriere-ES (Figure 44): The integrated status assessment was Amber with data up to 2010 and Amber with data up to 2015. All seven algorithms could assign statuses for every year since 1995. Most algorithms indicate worse status in recent years compared to the late 1990s. All seven algorithms assigned Amber or NotRed for 2008 to 2017, matching the expert assessments of Amber with data up to 2010 and up to 2015. Four of the algorithms picked up a worsening status since 2018, shifting to Red. For data up to 2010 and up to 2015, Learning Tree 3 assigns Amber and matches the integrated assessments.\n• Pitt-ES (Figure 45): The integrated status assessment was Amber/Green with data up to 2010 and Green with data up to 2015. All seven algorithms could assign statuses for every year since 1995. Most of the algorithms give statuses that match the integrated assessment with data up to 2015, and almost match the integrated assessments with data up to 2010. The three versions of the Learning Tree algorithm assign Green to most years since 1995, but two of them switched to Amber in 2010, and all three switched to Amber in 2019. Overall, four of the seven algorithms indicate a worsening status in 2019.\n• Shuswap-ES (Figure 46): The integrated status assessment was Amber/Green with\ndata up to 2010 and Amber with data up to to 2015. All seven algorithms could assign statuses for every year since 1995. The three fitted algorithms (Minimalist, Fancy Pants, and CategorcialRealist) assigned Amber status for most years since 1995. The three versions of the Learning Tree algorithm switched from Amber to Green in 2002. Overall, four of the algorithms indicate a worsening status in 2019. For data up to 2010, Learning Tree 3 assigns Green and almost matches the integrated assessment. For data up to 2015, Learning Tree 3 assigns Green, a full status category better than the integrated assessment of Amber. Experts in the status reassessment workshop, looking at data up to 2015, used additional information to downgrade the status: (1) low abundance, (2) declining trends on off-cycle years.\n• Taseko-ES (Figure 47): The integrated status assessment was Red with data up to 2010 and Red with data up to 2015. All seven algorithms could assign statuses for every year since 2006, but most algorithms have a 3-4 year gap in status assignments in the early 2000s. Almost all completed status assignments since 1997 are Red, except for 2005, where two algorithms assigned Green, two assigned Amber, one assigned Red, and two could not assign a status. For data up to 2010 and up to 2015, Learning Tree 3 assigns Red and matches the integrated assessments.\n155\n\fFigure 38. Retrospective test of rapid status - Fraser Sockeye - Anderson-Seton-ES.

The integrated assessment and retrospective test cover 4 CUs in the Summer run sockeye management unit:\n• Chilko-S-ES (Figure 48): The integrated status assessment was Green with data up to 2010 and Green with data up to 2015. All seven algorithms could assign statuses for every year since 1995. Six of the seven algorithms picked up a worsening status in the early 2000s, followed by an improvement in the 2010s. All seven algorithms indicated a worse status (Red, Red/Amber, or Amber) than the expert workshop (Green) with data up to 2010, but most of the rapid statuses switched to Green within a year or two. Most algorithms matched the Green integrated status assessment for data up to 2015. Four of the algorithms then indicate worsening status starting in 2017/2018, shortly after the last integrated status assessment was completed in 2017 with data up to 2015. For data up to to 2010, Learning Tree 3 assigns Amber, one full status category worse than the integrated status assigned in the expert workshop. For data up to to 2015, Learning Tree 3 assigns Green and matches the integrated status assigned in the expert workshop.\n• Francois-Fraser-S (Figure 49): The integrated status assessment was Red/Amber\nwith data up to 2010 and Amber/Green with data up to 2015. This CU accounts for 2 of 5 cases where Learning Tree 3 assigns a better status than the expert workshop consensus, and does so with high confidence. However, the differences are actually small in terms of the original scoring, where they account for only a half-step (Amber vs. Red/Amber, Green vs. Amber/Green). The case narratives from the workshop explain that status was downgraded due to high uncertainty in the estimated benchmarks for the relative abundance metric (Sgen, Smsy). Section 4.4 discusses the details. The majority of algorithms, including Learning Tree 3, indicate Amber status for most years since 2006. For data up to 2010, Learning Tree 3 assigns Amber, which almost matches the Red/Amber integrated status assigned in the expert workshop. For data up to 2015, Learning Tree 3 assigns Green which almost matches the integrated status of Amber/Green assigned in the expert workshop.\n• Quesnel-S (Figure 50): The integrated status assessment was Red/Amber with data up to 2010 and Red/Amber with data up to 2015. Six of the seven algorithms indicate Green or NotRed status from the mid-1990s to the mid-2000s, followed by worsening status, and turning into Red sometime around 2009. One algorithm, the Minimalist, points to an improvement in status around 2017/2018, but the other six algorithms continue to show poor status. For data up to 2010 and up to 2015, Learning Tree 3 assigns Red status, which almost matches the integrated status of Red/Amber assigned in the expert workshop.\n• Takla-Trembleur-Stuart-S (Figure 51): The integrated status assessment was\nRed/Amber with data up to 2010 and Red/Amber with data up to 2015. This CU accounts for 1 of 5 cases where Learning Tree 3 assigns a better status than the expert workshop consensus and does so with high confidence. However, the difference is actually small in terms of the original scoring, where it accounts for only a half-step (Amber vs. Red/Amber). The case narrative from the workshop explains that status was down-graded due to high uncertainty in the estimated benchmarks for the relative abundance metric (Sgen, Smsy), combined with a steep decline in abundance\n166\n\f(i.e. percent change). Section 4.4 discusses the details. Most algorithms indicate Amber status for most years since 2006, which is a half-step above the last integrated assessment with data up to 2015.:\nFigure 48.

The integrated assessment and retrospective test covers 4 CUs in the Late run sockeye management unit:\n• Harrison-DS-L (Figure 52): The integrated status assessment was Green with data up to 2010 and Amber/Green with data up to 2015. Five of the seven algorithms could assign statuses for every year since 1995. Simply Red could only assign status for 2 years in the retrospective, and Fancy Pants couldn’t assign any statuses. All three versions of the Learning Tree algorithm picked up a worsening status in the early 2010s (from Green to Amber or Red), but two of the three indicate a status improvement within 2 years. Overall, the algorithms indicate no major change in status since the expert workshop assigned an integrated status of Amber/Green with data up to 2015. For data up to 2010, Learning Tree 3 assigns Green status and matches the integrated status assigned in the expert workshop. For data up to 2015, Learning Tree 3 assigns Red status, much worse than the Amber/Green integrated status assigned by experts. Learning Tree 3 assigned Red due to the steep decline (Percent change = -71%), but workshop participants down-weighted this metric because the decline came after very large spawner abundances in the early 2000s.\n• Harrison-US-L (Figure 53): The integrated status assessment was Amber with data\nup to 2010 and Red with data up to 2015. All seven algorithms could assign statuses for every year since 1995. All three versions of the Learning Tree algorithm match the expert assessments, assigning Amber status for 1995 to 2014, then switching to Red in 2015. Overall, all the algorithms indicate that status has not improved since the last integrated expert assessment.\n• Lillooet-Harrison-L (Figure 54): The integrated status assessment was Green with data up to 2010 and Amber with data up to 2015. All seven algorithms could assign statuses for every year since 1995. Five of the seven algorithms indicated a worse status than the expert workshop for 2010 (Amber vs. Green), but by 2015 the algorithms and experts assign the same Amber status. Six of the seven algorithms indicate a worsening status since the last integrated assessment, switching to Red in either 2017 or 2019. Learning Tree 3 assigns Amber for data up to 2010, one full status category worse than the expert assessment. For data up to 2015, Learning Tree 3 assigns Amber and matches the expert assessment.\n• Shuswap-L (Figure 55): The integrated status assessment was Green with data up to\n2010 and Amber/Green with data up to 2015. All seven algorithms could assign statuses for every year since 1995. Rapid statuses for this CU differ a lot between algorithms, with the three fitted algorithms and the Simply Red algorithm frequently assigning worse statuses than the three versions of the Learning Tree algorithm. The Learning Tree algorithms generate statuses that closely match the expert assessments with data up to 2010 and up to 2015, and all the Learning Tree algorithms indicate a worsening status after the last expert assessment, shifting from Green to Amber in 2017 or 2018.\n171\n\fFigure 52.

The integrated assessment and retrospective test covers 4 CUs in the Late run sockeye management unit:\n• Harrison-R (Figure 56): The integrated status assessment was Green with data up to 2010 and Green with data up to 2015. All seven algorithms could assign statuses for every year since 2007, and four algorithms could assign status since 1995. The three Learning Tree algorithms assigned Red status for the early part of the retrospective, from 1995 to 2006, then improving gradually (e.g. switched from Red to Amber in 2007, then to Green in 2011, one year after the expert workshop assigned and integrated status of Green). With data up to 2015, six of the seven algorithms match the expert assessment of Amber. Overall, five of the seven algorithms indicate a worsening status since the last expert assessment. The Learning Tree algorithms switch to Amber in 2017, and to Red in 2019. Minimalist, Fancy Pants and Simply Red all indicate a stable Green or NotRed for 2007 to 2018, then a switch to a poorer status: Amber for Minimalist, Red for Fancy Pants and Simply Red.\n• Widgeon-RT (Figure 57): The integrated status assessment was Red with data up to 2010 and Red with data up to 2015. Only Minimalist and the three versions of the Learning Tree algorithm could assign statuses for all years since 1997. Most of the completed rapid status assignments since 1995 are Red. Two of the algorithms indicated an improvement in status in the early 2010s, but by 2014 all three Learning Tree versions assigned a Red status, and by 2018 all six algorithms that could assign a rapid status assign Red. Overall, there is no indication that status has improved since the last expert assessment with data up to 2015.\n176\n\fFigure 56.

The integrated assessment and retrospective test covers 5 CUs in the Lower Fraser Chinook management unit:\n• Lower Fraser River_FA_0.3 (Figure 58): The integrated status assessment was\nGreen with data up to 2012. All seven algorithms could assign statuses for every year since 1995. The Categorical Realist assigned Amber status for all years. The other algorithms all assign changing status over time, with worse statuses up to 1998, better statuses for 1999 to 2007, worse statuses for 2008 to 2010/2011, brief improvement around 2012, and then worse status. Six of the seven algorithms assign Red status for 2019. Five of the algorithms match the expert assessment for 2012, while the other two assign a worse status.\n• Lower Fraser River_SP_1.3 (Figure 59): The integrated status assessment was To\nBe Determined with data up to 2012. At the time, there was no site classified as wild, and therefore the CU was not assessed. However, experts in the workshop noted that “the classification of enhancement level needs to be reviewed because enhancement stopped in 2002 brood year and the system now has natural spawners. There are also a number of locations within this TU that have no enhancement but are not surveyed.” Since then, the site classifications have been updated (Brown et al. 2020). All 7 algorithms could assign statuses since 2017 and all of them assign Red. Before 2017 4 of the algorithms could assign statuses back to 2000, and 1 algorithm back to 1995. For 2016 and earlier the statuses assigned by the algorithms ranging from Red to Green.\n• Lower Fraser River-Upper Pitt_SU_1.3 (No Figure): Notes from the workshop in 2012 state: Based on available data and the metrics presented, most groups assessed this CU as Red due to declining trends and low abundance. However, participants agreed to a DD assessment based on additional information provided by a participating expert (the single site with data is not representative, and surveys of additional sites within the CU are currently not feasible). Specifically, the rationale was “Time series of good quality data available, but considered not representative of whole CU. Only 1 population surveyed but others may exist that are not yet known.” Therefore, the CU was not assessed in either the expert workshop or in the retrospective test.\n• Lower Fraser River_SU_1.3 (No Figure): Notes from the workshop in 2012 state: Time series of good quality data available but considered not representative of whole CU. Data available for only 1 site out of 7 (most abundant site cannot be assessed due to low visibility), and for the site with data, the time series is too short. Therefore, the CU was not assessed in either the expert workshop or in the retrospective test.\n• Maria Slough_SU_0.3 (No Figure): Notes from the workshop in 2012 state: The CU\nhas received an enormous amount of stewardship and watershed restoration activity. Human land-use impacts have changed the hydrography of this geographically small CU. There is no data for wild sites in the CU. Therefore, the CU was not assessed in either the expert workshop or in the retrospective test.\n179\n\fFigure 58.

The integrated assessment and retrospective test covers 5 CUs in the Upper Fraser Chinook management unit:\n• Middle Fraser-Fraser Canyon_SP_1.3 (No Figure): Data available, but none meet the quality criteria. Only records are opportunistic observations during Sockeye Salmon surveys. Therefore, the CU was not assessed in either the expert workshop or in the retrospective test.\n• Middle Fraser River-Portage_FA_1.3 (Figure 60): The integrated status assessment\nwas Red with data up to 2012. All seven algorithms could assign statuses for every year since 2014, and they all assigned Red status for all years since then.\n• Middle Fraser River_SP_1.3 (Figure 61): The integrated status assessment was Red with data up to 2012. All seven algorithms assigned Red for 2009 to 2013. From 2014 to 2017 a variable number of algorithms could assign status, and statuses differed between algorithms but stayed mostly stable for each algorithm. All seven algorithms assign Red status for 2019. For 2012, all seven algorithms matched the expert assessment of Red.\n• Middle Fraser River_SU_1.3 (No Figure): Experts in the status workshop completed a status assessment of this CU and assigned Amber status due to mixed signals across metrics. A subsequent review (Brown et al. 2020) found that the available data are not usable for WSP metrics, due to site-specific challenges. For example, ”the Stuart River has a large number of fish, up to 15,000 in some years; however, the percentage of the fish that are counted is unknown and varies annually depending on the water clarity. Winds on Stuart Lake disturb the shoreline sediments and can lead to visibility of less than 1m in some years, whereas in others, visibility can be up to 4m. In the mid-2000s, the noise in the time series was believed to exceed any signal and the surveys were dropped from the monitoring program. Therefore, the CU was not assessed in either the expert workshop or in the retrospective test.\n• Upper Fraser River_SP_1.3 (Figure 62): The integrated status assessment was Red\nwith data up to 2012. All seven algorithms assigned Red for 2009 to 2015 and matched the expert assessment for 2012. For 2016 and 2017, five algorithms could assign status, and statuses ranged from Red to Green. All seven algorithms switched back to Red status starting in 2018.\n182\n\fFigure 60. Retrospective test of rapid status approximations – Upper Fraser Chinook – Middle Fraser River-Portage_FA_1.3.

The integrated assessment and retrospective test cover 8 CUs in the Upper Fraser Chinook management unit:\n• South Thompson_SU_0.3 (Figure 63): The integrated status assessment was Green with data up to 2012. Five of the algorithms, including Learning Tree 3 could assign status since 2011, with each algorithm assigning a stable status across all years, but statuses ranging from Red to Green across algorithms. Two algorithms could not assign status for any year. Learning Trees 1 and 2 assigned Green for 2012, matching the expert assessment, but Learning Tree 3 assigned Amber.\n• South Thompson_SU_1.3 (Figure 64): The integrated status assessment was\nRed/Amber with data up to 2012. Five of the algorithms, including Learning Tree 3 could assign status since 2013, with four algorithms assigning a stable status across all years, but statuses ranging from Red to Green across algorithms. Two algorithms could not assign status for any year. No algorithm could assign a rapid status for 2012, because updated data based on Brown et al. (2020) excludes some earlier records, and therefore trend metrics can now only be calculated starting in 2013.\n• Shuswap River_SU_0.3 (Figure 65): Experts at the status workshop (DFO 2016)\ndesignated this CU as one of 11 SBC Chinook CUs that are type-4 data deficient (i.e. (good quality data is available, but none for wild sites). Since then, the lower Shuswap river spawning area (nuSEDS popID = 46437) was reclassified as having a low level of enhanced contribution, and therefore a time series for CU status assessment is now available. Prior to 2018, four algorithms (Minimalist and Learning Trees 1-3) could assign a status every years since 1997, and Fancy Pants could assign status for 1999-2004. Statuses are stable over time for three of the four algorithms, but range from Amber to Green across algorithms for each year. Six algorithms could assign status for 2018-2019, and all indicate a worsening status.\n• South Thompson-Bessette Creek_SU_1.2 (No Figure): Experts at the status\nworkshop (DFO 2016) assigned a provisional Red status, noting “precipitous decline and extremely low numbers (but need to revisit CU definition). If this is accepted as a CU, then no question that the population has declined drastically.” Brown et al (2020) note that spawner surveys have been very inconsistent and state that “This may no longer be a distinct CU due to small population size, straying from Middle Shuswap and hatchery practices.” Therefore, the CU was not included in the retrospective test.\n• Lower Thompson_SP_1.2 (Figure 66): The integrated status assessment was Red\nwith data up to 2012. All seven algorithms could assign status from 2009 to 2013, and all assign Red for those years, matching the integrated assessment in 2012. From 2014 to 2018, five algorithms could assign a status, with statuses mostly stable for each algorithm, but ranging from Red to Green across algorithms. All seven algorithms switched back to Red for 2019.\n• North Thompson_SP_1.3 (No Figure): Experts at the status workshop (DFO 2016)\nassigned Red status, noting “very strong short-term decline and very low numbers of fish, combined with high uncertainty due to small number of data points.” Brown et al (2020) conclude that standard WSP metrics cannot be calculated for the available data due to poor counting conditions and inconsistent site coverage.\n186\n\f• North Thompson_SU_1.3 (Figure 67): The integrated status assessment was Red\nwith data up to 2012. All seven algorithms could assign status for all years starting in 2011 and assigned Red for all years with completed statuses, including 2012 to match the expert assessment.\n• Upper Adams River_SU_x.x (No Figure): Experts at the status workshop (DFO 2016) designated this CU as data deficient, because available spawner estimates are based on redd counts, which are difficult to assess consistently, and the CU is not routinely surveyed. Brown et al (2020) further note that Chinook in the Upper Adams were extirpated by a dam, then re-stocked from various sources with different life histories after dam removal. While the population appears to be self-sustaining, but abundance estimates are low and data are sparse. Therefore, the CU was not included in the retrospective test.\n187\n\fFigure 63.

The integrated assessment and retrospective test cover 8 CUs in the Inner South Coast Chinook management unit:\n• Boundary Bay_FA_0.3 (No Figure):\n• Southern Mainland-Georgia Strait_FA_0.x (No Figure): Experts at the status workshop (DFO 2016) designated this CU as data deficient, because “No recent, high quality escapement records for wild sites.” Brown et al (2020) summarize the data issues.

The integrated assessment and retrospective test covers 3 CUs in the WCVI Chinook management unit:\n• WCVI-South-Fall 0.x (Figure 69): The integrated status assessment was Red with data up to 2012. Four of the seven algorithms could assign statuses for every year since 1995. The other three algorithms could assign a status for every year since 2009. For five algorithms, all the assigned statuses are Red. Six of the seven algorithms assign Red for 2012, matching the integrated status assign in the expert workshop. Notes from the workshop in 2012 state: “Most groups designated this CU as Red, but due mostly to pressures (straying from large-scale hatchery releases, including seapens, and high exploitation rates (roughly 60%) rather than to abundance or observed trends. Data from 2 small populations among 21 possible wild sites is not considered to be representative. Participants recommended completion of further work to determine whether these populations still exist as a CU under WSP definition”. Note that subsequent data revisions increased the number of indicator systems included in the time series to four.\n• WCVI-Nootka & Kyuquot-Fall 0.x (Figure 70): The integrated status assessment was Red with data up to 2012. Four of the seven algorithms could assign statuses for every year since 1998. The other three algorithms could assign a status for every year since 2009. Six of the algorithms show status dropping to Red for several years around 2010, then starting to improve around 2015. Notes from the expert workshop in 2012 state: “Most groups designated this CU as Red, but this was the result of considerations other than the 3 WSP metrics. Rather, participants highlighted the following concerns: only a small portion of total abundance in wild sites and impacts of straying are likely, very small index of abundance of wild sites.”\n• WCVI-North-Fall 0.x (Figure 71): The CU was not assessed in the expert workshop, but subsequent revisions to site classifications generated a CU-level time series based on two indicator systems (Marble, Cayeghle). Four of the seven algorithms assign a consistent status since 1999, but statuses differed between algorithms (Categorical Realist and Learning Tree 3 assign Amber to all years, Learning Trees 1 and 2 assign Green to all years). The other three algorithms assign Amber/NotRed starting in 2010, then shift to Red from 2013-2016, and back to Amber/NotRed in 2017.\n195\n\fFigure 69.

LRPs are required for major fsh stocks, or Stock Management Units (SMUs) that are prescribed by regulation under amendments to the Canadian Fisheries Act (2019). Pacifc salmon are unique among marine fsh stocks due to their high levels of intraspecifc diversity which gives rise to a large range in data availability, considerations, and approaches for assessments and LRP development. In this paper, we identify six principles for developing LRPs for Pacifc salmon that are adapted from principles used more broadly among marine species. One principle unique to Pacifc salmon is that LRPs should be aligned with Canada’s Wild Salmon Policy (WSP) objective of preserving biodiversity of salmon at the scale of Conservation Units (CUs), which are nested within SMUs. We developed methods for calculating LRPs, and established guidelines on how to implement them including under which conditions they should or should not be applied. We propose that LRPs be identifed from the proportion of CUs that have status above the Red zone for WSP status assessments, as a default approach. This provides some consistency with status assessments already produced under the WSP, and can inform management decisions for harvest, habitat and hatcheries that often occur at fner, CU scales. To supplement the default approach, we provide LRPs based on metrics of aggregate abundances for the entire SMU, which may be required for fsheries management purposes in some cases. These latter LRPs are derived to have a desired probability of all component CUs being above Red status given an assumed relationship between aggregate abundance and the probability that all CUs will be above Red status. We identify uncertainties associated with each approach, and describe how they can be applied across a range of data types, qualities and quantities. Analyses to support our development of guidelines has been informed by three cases studies: Interior Fraser Coho Salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch, West Coast Vancouver Island Chinook Salmon, O. tshawytscha, and Inside South Coast Chum Salmon, O. keta, excluding the Fraser River.\niv\n\f1.\nINTRODUCTION\n1.1. BACKGROUND\nKEY POINTS:\n•\nThe revised Fisheries Act includes new Fish Stocks provisions that introduced legal obligations to identify limit reference points (LRPs) for major fsh stocks prescribed under regulation.\n• Under DFO’s Precautionary Approach Framework, LRPs defne the stock status below\nwhich serious harm is expected to occur to the stock.\n•\n• Canada’s Wild Salmon Policy (WSP) includes an objective to safeguard the genetic diversity of wild Pacifc salmon by maintaining and protecting Conservation Units (CUs), the focus of biological assessments under the WSP. The revised Fisheries Act indicates that a single LRP is required for each major fsh stock, defned as Stock Management Units (SMUs) for Pacifc salmon, which are groups of CUs managed as a unit to achieve joint status. This provision created the need for the development of methodologies to estimate LRPs for assessment and management at the SMU level, while considering the need to maintain CUs within an SMU above their lower benchmarks under the WSP.\n•\nAmendments to the Canadian Fisheries Act (2019) include new Fish Stocks provisions that introduce legal obligations to manage stocks to promote sustainability and avoid biological limit reference points, LRPs (DFO 2021a). The provisions also require plans to rebuild fsh stocks that have declined to, or below, an LRP while taking into account the biology of the fsh and environmental conditions experienced by the stock. These obligations apply to major fsh stocks that are prescribed under regulations. They reinforce the previously established DFO policies to manage stocks consistent with the precautionary approach. These include The Fishery Decision Making Framework Incorporating the Precautionary Approach (DFO 2009a), also known as DFO’s Precautionary Approach Framework within the Sustainable Fisheries Framework and Canada’s Wild Salmon Policy (DFO 2005).\nUnder DFO’s Precautionary Approach Framework, LRPs represent the stock status below which serious harm is expected to occur to the stock. Defnitions of serious harm within the DFO literature tend to focus on impaired productivity, although other aspects of serious harm are sometimes captured (see grey box below, adapted from Marentette et al. (In\n)1).\nprep.\n1Marentette, J.R., Barrett, T., Cogliati, K.M., Ings, D., Ladell, J., Thiess, M. Operationalizing Serious Harm: Existing Guidance and Contemporary Canadian Practices. Can. Sci Avis. Secr. Res. Doc. In\nprep.\n1\n\f1.1.1. Interpretations of serious harm\nSerious harm has been interpreted as any changes to the biological properties of the stock that make growth or rebuilding to target levels cease to be considered rapid and secure1. These changes are considered difficult to reverse2,3, and can be associated with: •\nimpaired productivity1-6 resulting from changes to biological processes such as recruitment, growth, maturation and survival1,4; a loss of resilience5 (an impaired ability to rebuild or to recover from perturbation6); increased risk of depensation or Allee effects4; and/or\n• • • more generally, states where population dynamics cease to be well-understood4. At this status level, there may also be resultant impacts to the ecosystem, associated species and a long-term loss of fshing opportunities6. Serious harm may be due to fshing, other human-induced mortality, or changes in population dynamics unrelated to fshing4.\n1(DFO 2016a); 2(Kronlund et al. 2018); 3(Shelton and Rice 2002); 4(DFO 2006); 5(Smith et al. 2012); 6(DFO 2009a)\nThe defnition of serious harm from DFO (2009a) indicates that LRPs should be above the level where serious harm is expected to occur, not at the level where it is occurring, and that long-term losses of fshing opportunities may occur below that l evel. Defning the level before serious harm occurs to a species or ecosystem is a pervasive challenge as harm is often not identifed until it is already occurring (Hilborn and Walters 1992) and population dynamics are not well understood at low population sizes (DFO 2006; Keith and Hutchings 2012). Also, this defnition of serious harm includes possible impacts on other ecosystem components, which are often challenging to identify because of limited data and poor understanding of ecosystem linkages and dynamics (but see Chagaris et al. 2020).\nPacifc salmon are unique among marine fsh species due to their high levels of intraspecifc diversity which gives rise to a large range in data availability, considerations, and approaches for assessments and LRP development. These differences necessitate guidance on LRP methods that is specific to Pacific salmon, while being consistent with the principles for LRP development across species (Marentette et al. In\n).\nprep.\nCanada’s Wild Salmon Policy, WSP, represents DFO’s implementation of the Precautionary Approach Framework for Pacifc s almon. The goal of the WSP is to restore and maintain healthy and diverse salmon populations and their habitats for the beneft and enjoyment of the people of Canada in perpetuity (DFO 2005). One objective of the WSP is to safeguard the genetic diversity of wild Pacifc salmon by maintaining and protecting Conservation Units (CUs), where a CU is defned as a “group of wild salmon suffciently isolated from other groups that, if extirpated is very unlikely to recolonize naturally within an acceptable time frame, such as a human lifetime or a specifed number of salmon generations” (DFO 2005).\nGenetic and phenotypic diversity among CUs is important because it allows for diversity in responses to threats and environmental drivers, contributing to the sustainability of the species and the ecosystem services they provide (Price et al. 2021). Portfolio effects have been shown to dampen interannual variance in aggregate-level abundances due to independent dynamics among component populations or CUs (Schindler et al. 2010). Population and life-history diversity may buffer species from environmental variability and contribute to long-term stability through differing responses to environmental changes. However, deterioration of portfolio effects have been observed for Pacifc salmon in Canada due to synchronous declining trends in abundances\n2\n\frelated to changes in climate and marine and freshwater habitats, as well as fshing practices that have historically overfshed weak populations (Price et a l. 2021).\nUnder the WSP, the status of individual CUs is inferred by comparing status indicators to biological benchmarks delineating three zones: Green, Amber, and Red. These zones represent increasing conservation concern from Green to Red requiring increasing management intervention. The lower benchmark, delineating the Red and Amber zones, is intended to be at the level to “ensure there is a substantial buffer between it and any level of abundance that could lead to a CU being considered at risk of extinction by COSEWIC”, where COSEWIC is the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (DFO 2005; Holt et al. 2009). In practice, CUs in the WSP Red zone tend to align with Endangered or Threatened COSEWIC statuses, and Green with Not at Risk COSEWIC categories.\n1.1.2.\nSpatial scales of assessment\nSalmon have a complex hierarchical populations structure that extends from taxonomic species to local demes or spawning locations (Fig. 1). CUs are nested within taxonomic species and major life-history variants, such as ocean- and stream-type for Chinook Salmon, Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, and populations are nested within CUs (DFO 2005). While assessments of Pacifc salmon under the WSP has focused on setting benchmarks for individual salmon CUs (DFO 2005), the revised Fisheries Act indicates that a single LRP is required for each major fsh stock(DFO 2021a). In the context of Pacifc salmon, major fsh stocks are defned as Stock Management Units (SMUs), which are groups of CUs that are managed as a unit to achieve joint status (DFO 2021b). The delineation of SMUs was in part a response to the national-level requirement for delineating major stocks for Pacifc salmon under the Fisheries A ct. This provision created the need for the development of methodologies to estimate LRPs for the assessment and management of fsheries at the SMU level, while considering the need to maintain all CUs within an SMU in Amber or Green zones, i.e., above Red status.\nIn addition to intrinsic biological reasons for assessing status at the CU scale, this scale is also relevant to various uses and management activities for Pacifc salmon, e.g., local or terminal fsheries; food, social and ceremonial fsheries; hatchery enhancement; and watershed restoration and planning (Fig. 1). While the Fish Stocks provisions pertain to fsheries at scales relevant to marine harvest management, for many SMUs those fsheries have been restricted in recent decades (Grant et al. 2020b), such that habitat and hatchery management are playing an increasingly dominant role in management responses. Food, social and ceremonial use of salmon by First Nations occur at a variety of scales, often within CUs at the level of populations or specifc spawning locations. In addition, threats and management responses extend to larger regional or aggregate- SMU scales, and across species, e.g., impacts related to climate change. Therefore, stock assessment and management are required at a hierarchy of spatial scales from within CUs to regional scales, across species.\nGiven the existing framework for assessing status of Pacifc salmon by CU (Holt et a l. 2009) and the similar intent between LRPs defned by DFO’s Precautionary Approach Framework and lower benchmarks under the WSP, status against lower benchmarks can be used as a proxy for status against LRPs but applied at the scale of CUs instead of SMUs. The present work expands on assessment methods developed under the WSP by integrating statuses across CUs within an SMU and providing guidance on establishing LRPs at the scale of Pacifc salmon SMUs. While CUs are nested within SMUs, the number of CUs within each SMU varies among salmon species. For example, SMUs for Sockeye Salmon, Oncorhynchus nerka, tend to contain a larger\n3\n\fnumber of CUs than those for other salmon species because of the relatively high levels of local adaptation and biodiversity among spawning populations, and the associated small spatial scale of Sockeye CUs compared with other species.\nFigure 1. Schematic representation of hierarchical, nested population structure of Pacifc salmon (left) with the spatial scales of selected uses and management activities aligned with those scales, including the scale of Stock Management Unit, SMU (right)\n.\nThe existing framework for CU assessments includes consideration of the fne-scale distribution of spawners within CUs, e.g., at the stream level (DFO 2016b). Here we also consider the distribution of populations within CUs in the assessment when it is considered to be important for the sustainability of the CU or SMU. Identifying relevant spatial scales within CUs when assessing status can be challenging due to uncertainty and temporal variability in meta-population dynamics and the impacts of those dynamics on long-term viability, which represents a key source of uncertainty when defning LRPs.\nAlternative spatial scales of assessment and management are used by agencies outside of DFO for Pacifc salmon, including Designatable Units used by COSEWIC which largely align with DFO’s CUs, and Stock Groups under the Pacifc Salmon Treaty, which align to some extent with SMUs. These units are not considered further here. Although the LRPs presented are intended to be applied at the SMU scale, these methods could also be applied at smaller or larger scales to inform a variety of management decisions.\nWe highlight previous recommendations to develop Integrated Management Processes where management objectives (including those related to biodiversity and sustainability) and management actions are integrated across biological and socioeconomic relevant scales, sectors, and decision- making bodies (Withler et al. 2018). Importantly, Withler et al. (2018) recommend management systems that adaptively respond to statuses from routine assessments at relevant spatial scales.\n4\n\f1.2.

Recommendations on future research\no This paper is scoped to focus on the estimation of LRPs with corresponding guidelines, and does not include a full quantitative evaluation of those LRPs. That step is included as an important area of future research.\n•\n1.2.1. Goals\nThe goals of this Research Document as outlined in the Terms of Reference, were to:\n• Develop candidate methods for identifying SMU-level LRPs for Pacifc salmon that are\nconsistent with the WSP objective of conserving biodiversity by maintaining CUs above lower biological benchmarks. These candidate methods include LRPs based on the status of component CUs and aggregate abundance over multiple CUs, where CU assessments can be developed using a multidimensional or single-metric approaches, as appropriate. (Section 4)\n• Document candidate methods for developing LRPs at the SMU-level, including data requirements and assumptions. (Section 4 and Appendix B). More details are provided in Holt et al. (2023).\n• Document key uncertainties that affect LRP estimates for each method considered, including\nuncertainties arising from missing or limited CU-level data. (Section 6)\n• Provide guidance and recommendations on the application of candidate methods over a\nrange of data types and availability. (Section 5)\n1.2.2. What’s in this Research Document?\nThis Research Document addresses these four goals, while the companion Research Document (Holt et al. 2023) provides a more detailed and technical descriptions of candidate methods for developing LRPs and more fully demonstrates their implementation on three case studies. Summaries of methods are included here for the completeness of these guidelines.\nIn particular, this paper has six sections:\n5\n\f1.\nIntroduction\n\nA review of reference points and their roles for Pacifc salmon\nPrinciples for the development of LRPs for Pacifc salmon\nA description of candidate LRP methods, with further details in Holt et al. (2023). Appendix A\n\nsummarizes their application to three case studies.\n\nGuidelines on the implementation of LRPs including recommendations on when, and when\n\nnot to use each candidate LRP method\n\nDiscussion of uncertainties and recommendations on future research\n\nThis work was supported by a technical working group composed of DFO and First Nations analysts with analytical expertise in stock assessment and the biological basis of serious harm. The technical working group was not intended to be a venue for consultation or to capture stakeholder perspectives and socioeconomic objectives. While these considerations are relevant when developing management responses to stock assessments, they were not considered necessary for the development of analytical methods for LRPs.\n1.2.3. Scope\nWhile candidate LRPs were evaluated to an extent through sensitivity analyses and retrospective analyses, a more rigorous closed-loop simulation evaluation of candidate LRPs was beyond the scope of both Research Documents, and is recommended as a next step. Also, our applications of LRP methods to case studies are for illustrative purposes only, and are not meant to be a formal estimation of LRPs for those SMUs. Additional LRP methods could be developed in the future, aligned with the key principles outlined here (Section 3).\nTime-varying population processes, such as changes in productivity, have important impacts on biological benchmarks, LRPs, and assessment against LRPs. While we describe some recent approaches for considering those impacts in Section 6, a comprehensive review and evaluation of the impacts of time-varying parameters on LRPs is beyond the scope of this study. This theme is an important area for future research.\nWhen developing LRPs, we follow the recommendations of Withler et al. (2018) to remove hatchery-infuenced populations from biological assessments under the WSP when hatchery production predominates over natural production, as described in Section 4. Following recent WSP assessments, we also removed the demographic infuence of hatchery production from time-series of abundances when data on the proportion of hatchery- vs. natural-origin fsh on the spawning grounds were available in our case studies. An evaluation of methods for estimating proportion of hatchery-origin spawners or accounting for them in biological assessments was beyond the scope of this study.\nHere we follow the recommendation of Holt et al. (2009) to assess status of CUs using multiple metrics, and have implemented this approach using the Pacific Salmon Status Scanner tool (or, Salmon Scanner), documented in Pestal et al. (In developed from the implementation of formal, peer-reviewed WSP assessments for Pacific salmon CUs in Canada (Section 4). A peer-review of the Salmon Scanner is planned for 2022 and is beyond the scope of this paper.\n)2. The Salmon Scanner was\nprep.\n2Pestal, G., MacDonald, B, Grant, S, and Holt, C.

This includes evaluating the costs and benefts of conserving individual CUs given differential vulnerability to climate change or other threats.\nWhile one role of LRPs is to trigger the development of rebuilding plans under the Fish Stocks provisions, the content and implementation of rebuilding plans is beyond the scope of this paper. A full review of how LRPs can be integrated into salmon management processes outside of the Fish Stocks provisions (e.g., including management of habitat and hatcheries) is also beyond our scope, and is a gap that warrants further discussion. We highlight a few possible roles for LRPs in Section 2.2. Lastly, we do not review the current defnition of ‘major fsh stock’ as a SMU for Pacifc salmon under the Fish Stocks provisions.\n\nREVIEW OF REFERENCE POINTS AND THEIR ROLES FOR PACIFIC SALMON\n\n2.1. INDICATORS AND REFERENCE POINTS FOR PACIFIC SALMON\nKEY POINTS:\n• •\nLRPs have been widely adopted in Canadian fsheries. LRPs can be identifed along a variety of indicators, and those indicators can be categorized as natural metrics, proxies for natural metrics, or composites of metrics.\n• Under Canada’s WSP, a composite of metrics (’multidimensional approach’) is used in status assessments, including metrics on current spawner abundances, short and long-term trends in abundances, and the distribution of spawning, among others.\n• DFO has recently developed the Pacifc Salmon Status Scanner tool to rapidly\n•\napproximate the multidimensional approach for salmon assessments. In some cases, single-metric approaches in which spawner abundances are compared with an abundance-based benchmark have been used as proxies for status under the WSP.\nLRPs are common in the assessment and management of marine fsheries where they are used to identify and communicate status, as components of objectives, and to trigger changes in harvest rates among other roles (Kronlund et al. 2021; Marentette et al. 2021) (Section 2.2). LRPs have been widely adopted in Canadian fsheries. A review based on a survey of 177 Canadian stocks excluding salmonids and transboundary stocks, found that 58% had adopted LRPs, although the methods used to estimate LRPs varied considerably among stocks (Marentette et al. 2021).\nLRPs and indicators of status can be categorized in ways that demonstrate the diversity of approaches that are available across data types and species life-histories. In particular, LRPs can be derived from theoretical relationships (e.g., stock-recruitment based reference points), historical patterns (e.g., abundance from which recovery has been observed in the past), or empirical analyses on abundances or life-history traits (Marentette et al. In ). For marine fish species, LRPs are typically estimated as a minimum level of spawning biomass (or proxy) that should not be breached (Shelton and Rice 2002; Kronlund et al. 2018; Marentette et al. 2021). DFO (2009a) identifies additional indicators such as catch rate indices, size and age profiles, and sex ratios that “can and should be considered for use in defining serious harm and guiding decision-making in relation to stock condition” (DFO 2009a). In general, indicators\nprep.\n7\n\fof status can be categorized as natural metrics (e.g., total abundances or other biological or population characteristics), a proxy for a natural metric (e.g., abundances of indicator stocks), or a composite of indicators that combine information over multiple dimensions or biological metrics of status (Marentette et al. In\n).\nprep.\nThe composite or multidimensional approach for assessing status, sometimes called a “traffc light” approach (Shelton and Rice 2002), is particularly useful when theoretical or historical abundance-based metrics are not estimable or applicable, or when data are limited (Dowling et al. 2015). Multidimensional approaches allow for consideration of numerous data sources often including expert knowledge to integrate conficting metrics within a ssessments. For example, multidimensional reference points have been applied to Snow Crab, Chionoecetes opilio, in Canada, where data on catch per unit effort, egg clutches, and discards are integrated in stock assessments (Mullowney et al. 2018). Multidimensional approaches can also be useful to address mismatches in scales among biological stocks, the unit of management, and the spatial scale of data collection, when metrics capture processes at a variety of scales. These scale mismatches are not uncommon among marine species, especially invertebrate and salmonid species (DFO 2016a; Mullowney et al. 2020). They can create challenges when identifying LRPs at the scale of major stocks (DFO 2021a), and can make undesirable states in fsh populations diffcult to detect and mitigate.\nMethods for estimating reference points for Pacifc salmon are diverse, often taking advantage of its semelparous and anadromous life-history and limits on capacity in freshwater, and other population characteristics (Chaput et al. 2012; Portley and Geiger 2014). Under Canada’s WSP, status assessments integrate data across numerous indicators or metrics representing different population characteristics, including current spawner abundances, short and long-term trends in abundances, distribution of spawning, and fshing mortality relative to population productivity (Holt et al. 2009). Benchmarks are established for each metric and an overall multidimensional estimate of CU status is obtained by integrating status among metrics (Grant and Pestal 2013; DFO 2015; DFO 2016b; Grant et al. 2020a). An advantage of this approach is that CUs missing data for any single metric can still be evaluated against remaining metrics, making the framework applicable across a relatively broad range of data types and hence CUs. Expert-driven processes to integrate often conficting metrics within the multidimensional framework have been implemented for numerous Pacifc salmon CUs in Canada, such as Fraser River Sockeye Salmon (Grant et al. 2012, 2020a; Grant and Pestal 2013), Interior Fraser River Coho Salmon, Oncorhynchus kisutch (DFO 2015), and Southern BC Chinook Salmon (DFO 2016b). However, these expert- driven processes can be challenging to implement on a broad and timely basis due to the high demand they place on time and staff resources. Based on the consistencies that emerged from assessments where the integration of multiple metrics has been applied, Pestal et al. (In prep. developed an algorithm to approximate overall WSP status by combining those metrics in a decision tree, at the scale of CUs. This algorithm was incorporated into DFO’s Pacifc Salmon Status Scanner and then verified by local assessment experts and tested with ‘out-of-sample’ CUs not included in the original formulation (Pestal et al. In\n).\n)\nprep.\nIn some cases, single-metric approaches in which spawner abundances are compared with an abundance-based benchmark have been used as proxies for WSP status both by organizations external to DFO (Commission 2016; Pacifc Salmon Foundation 2020) and occasionally within DFO (e.g., Barkley Sockeye Salmon, Chaput et al. 2012). One recommended lower benchmark on spawning abundances under Canada’s WSP is Sgen, the abundance resulting in recovery to SMSY in one salmon generation under equilibrium conditions (Holt 2009). Benchmarks on spawner abundances for data-limited contexts have also been identifed in recognition that the\n8\n\fdata required to estimate spawner-recruitment based benchmarks are often not available (e.g., Parken et al. 2006, Section 4.2). Biological benchmarks under the WSP are distinguished from triggers in harvest control rules that incorporate additional socioeconomic considerations beyond biological considerations (Holt and Irvine 2013).\n2.2. ROLES OF LRPS IN CANADA\nKEY POINTS:\n•\n• •\no o o\nThe roles of LRPs for marine fish stocks in Canada can include: triggering rebuilding plans under the Fish Stocks provisions, communicating conservation risks to decision makers and the public, informing management decisions about fisheries as part of measurable objectives or operational control points, and as a component of performance metrics within a Management Procedure Framework.\no\nIdentifying LRPs is the responsibility of DFO’s Science Sector. For Pacific salmon the application of LRPs has been limited, as fisheries management is often based on a wide range of management decisions made at different spatial scales (e.g., stream-level escapement goals, time-area closures, exploitation limits on aggregates).\nFor marine fsh stocks in Canada, LRPs have several roles including triggering rebuilding plans under DFO’s Precautionary Approach Framework (DFO 2009a) and the Fisheries Act, communicating conservation risks to decision makers and the public, and informing management decisions about fsheries. For example, LRPs can be used as part of measurable objectives and can also be applied as operational control points which are points where management actions are triggered within harvest control rules. A conservation goal might be to avoid low biomass levels where serious harm is expected to occur which can be translated to a measurable objective to avoid spawner abundances lower than an LRP with a high probability (e.g., 95%) over a specifed time period. This objective can then inform the placement of operational control points within the harvest control rule. However, there can be several operational control points in the harvest control rule and these can be positioned to achieve a suite of biological and socioeconomic objectives beyond those associated with serious harm, usually by a diverse range of managers, First Nations, and stakeholders. In contrast, DFO’s Science Sector is responsible for identifying LRPs based only on biological considerations (DFO 2021a).\nIn addition, LRPs can be used in performance metrics within a Management Procedure Framework (or Management Strategy Evaluation) to identify candidate procedures that achieve conservation objectives (e.g., 95% probability of staying above a LRP over a specifed period) among other objectives (DFO 2021c). This approach explicitly accounts for a range of uncertainties in the biology of the stock, dynamics of the feet, observations of abundances and ages at return, and the implementation of management decisions. Simulation evaluation of management procedures is widely viewed as a best practice for informing management decisions under uncertainty (Punt et al. 2020). For fsheries in which management procedures have been simulation tested, assessment of stock status relative to an LRP is not necessary so long as the management procedure selected has been demonstrated to meet conservation (and possibly other) objectives over a range of uncertainties (i.e., modelled scenarios) about stock and fshery dynamics. One advantage of this approach is that a single best underlying model (or LRP) describing the population and feet\n9\n\fdynamics need not be identifed. Instead, management procedures can be evaluated against a suite of plausible underlying models or assumptions.\nFor Pacifc salmon, the application of LRPs at the SMU-level has been more limited. Fisheries management for Pacifc salmon is often based on a wide range of management decisions made at different spatial scales (e.g., stream-level escapement goals, time-area closures, exploitation limits on aggregates), instead of LRPs per se. Also, the application of Management Procedure Frameworks is not common for Pacifc salmon where the impact of diverse management levers and their interactions are often diffcult to quantify (e.g., hatcheries and harvest, though see the AHA model documented by HSRG (Hatchery Scientifc Review Group) 2009). The roles of LRPs will likely evolve for Pacifc salmon over time, and an exhaustive review is beyond the scope of this paper.\n\nPRINCIPLES FOR LRP DEVELOPMENT\n\n3.1. PRINCIPLES\nKEY POINTS:\n•\n• • •\n• •\n•\n•\nPrinciples for identifying Pacifc salmon LRPs are adapted from national guidance on LRPs. Principle 1. LRPs should be selected based on the best available information. Principle 2. LRPs should be consistent with the goal of avoiding serious harm. Principle 3. LRPs should be operational, i.e., feasible to calculate and relevant to policy and management. Principle 4. LRPs should be reliably estimable and plausible. Principle 5. When selecting among multiple methods for determining LRPs, the choice should take into account uncertainty. Principle 6. Pacifc salmon LRPs should be consistent with the goals and objectives of the WSP. These principles are intended to guide our approach for developing Pacifc salmon LRPs while providing fexibility due to differences in local biological characteristics, data qualities and data quantities, among salmon species and stocks.\nHere we outline principles for developing LRPs for Pacific salmon, adapted from those developed for national-level guidance on LRPs (Marentette et al. In flexibility in the development of LRPs to respect differences in species life-histories and data types, quantities, and qualities, and is not meant to be prescriptive. By following similar principles, Pacifc salmon LRPs are aligned with national direction.\n). That guidance allows for\nprep.\nPrinciple 1. LRPs should be selected based on the best available information for the SMU, including evidence of serious harm, data and knowledge informing underlying biological processes, ). Criteria for Indigenous Knowledge, and comparison with similar SMUs (Marentette et al. In evaluating best scientific information developed for US National Standards may be applicable here (“US Code of Federal Regulations” 2021). These criteria are: relevance, inclusiveness, objectivity, transparency and openness, timeliness, verifcation and validation, and peer review. In addition, scientifc information should include an evaluation of uncertainties and identify gaps in our understanding or information. When uncertainty exists in identifying the most appropriate approach to defne an LRP, these uncertainties should be acknowledged and considered when\nprep.\n10\n\fproviding LRP recommendations. Where the weight-of-evidence supports a set of assumptions or hypotheses associated with a candidate LRP, then this LRP can be recommended. Where evidence is inconclusive, this uncertainty should be integrated into the estimation of status and the uncertainties should be clearly communicated.\nWithin this principle, it is recognized that science is not static and new fndings continually advance our understanding of best available information. In particular, peer-review is necessary to ensure that the quality and credibility of data and methods for LRP development meet the standards of the scientifc c ommunity. When determining whether to conduct a peer review, the level of novelty and complexity, and any previous peer-reviewed stock assessments, should be considered. Although routine updates may not need formal peer review, new LRPs or the application of benchmarks and LRPs to new CUs and SMUs may require peer review.\nSimilarly, best practices, or practices that have been demonstrated to work well, can be used to inform reference points, as defned by Sainsbury ( 2008): “The ‘best practice’ concept is based on the best practice that has been demonstrated through use, and recognizes that views of what is ‘best’ will continuously improve with experience. Best practice is not an absolute or fxed entity, or a guarantee of adequacy. It is based on experience to date and it is expected to evolve over time.”\nPrinciple 2. LRPs should be consistent with the goal of avoiding serious harm to the SMU, as described in DFO (2009a) and Section 1 of this paper. The LRP should be set above the level where serious harm occurs and should avoid long-term losses that may accompany such undesirable states, such as those related to fshing and ecosystem components, e.g., dependent predators (DFO 2009a, 2009b). In addition, LRPs should be representative of the entire SMU. In cases where only components of an SMU are monitored (e.g., CUs), the monitored component can be used to assess SMU status when it is thought to represent the entire SMU (Section 5).\nPrinciple 3. LRPs should be operational. They should be feasible to calculate based on data that are available and relevant to the policy context and management of fsheries on S MUs. Data availability varies widely among CUs and SMUs, requiring a variety of approaches for CU and SMU-level assessments. No one method will be operational across all cases. Also, it is benefcial if LRPs are easy to communicate to managers, First Nations, and stakeholders in a way that informs decisions at time-scales relevant to management. Other operational considerations are cost-effectiveness and simplicity in understanding.\nPrinciple 4. LRPs should be reliably estimated. To the extent possible, LRPs should indicate a level above where serious harm occurs with acceptable accuracy and precision, instead of capturing random noise or observation errors. Reliable estimation will depend on the quality and frequency of data collection, model specifcation, and the evidence to support underlying relationships and population dynamics used to derive LRPs. Reliability can be addressed by checking the sensitivity of LRPs to uncertainties in underlying data, models, or assumptions via sensitivity analyses or simulation-evaluation, or simply by assessing plausibility given biological or life-history information about the SMU (Marentette et al. In\n).\nprep.\nLRPs can be derived using multiple analytical approaches. If LRPs cannot be estimated reliably using one method or approach, then it is advisable to consider alternative approaches based on different sets of assumptions and/or data. When LRP estimates converge using different approaches, this increases support that the methods capture underlying population dynamics despite differing assumptions and use of available data.\n11\n\fWhere possible, a statistically integrated approach for estimating LRPs should be considered in order to propagate uncertainties throughout analyses and to be consistent with current best practices in fsheries stock assessments (Punt et a l. 2 020). Staton et a l. (2017) and DeFilippo et al. (2021) provide recent examples of integrated models used for salmon assessments. Both studies show that uncertainty propagation increases realism of model estimates and associated uncertainty. However, Staton et al. (2017) demonstrated that similar point estimates of current status can be achieved by using sequential estimation approaches and the benefts of statistically integrated approaches may not be large enough to warrant an integrated analysis in all cases.\nPrinciple 5. When selecting among multiple methods for defning LRPs, the choice should take into account uncertainty. Candidate methods for LRPs vary in how and the extent to which they account for uncertainty in underlying data, modelled population dynamics (parameter assumptions and model structure), and derivation of CU-level statuses. These uncertainties create risks of LRPs providing a misleading threshold of serious harm. All else being equal, methods that rely on high quality data, include fewer assumptions, and explicitly account for underlying uncertainties should be preferred.\nWhen considering LRPs under alternative model assumptions, LRPs can be chosen based on strength of evidence for underlying assumptions or averaged when alternative assumptions are equally plausible. Further, the sensitivity of LRPs to various underlying model assumptions or data qualities and quantities can be evaluated in simulation, where LRPs that are less sensitive to key uncertainties would be preferred.\nPrinciple 6. In addition to principles derived for marine species in general (Principles 1-5) and to meet the goal of avoiding serious harm under DFO’s Precautionary Approach Policy (Principle 2), Pacifc salmon LRPs should be consistent with the goals and objectives of the WSP. The WSP requires both the defnition of biological units and an assessment of their status along biological metrics, with lower benchmarks used to represent the level that avoids risk of extinction. This approach is consistent with avoiding serious harm to the CU. Above the lower benchmarks (above Red status), irreversible or slowly reversible impacts are avoided. Ignoring CU-level status by focusing solely on SMU-level status can result in serial depletion (or loss) of weak component CUs within an SMU, resulting in a possibly misleading indication status and serious harm. Therefore, to be consistent with the WSP, LRPs should consider status of component CUs.\n3.2. APPLYING THE PRINCIPLES TO LRP DEVELOPMENT\nOur goal is to provide overall guidelines on LRP development following the principles listed above while providing fexibility due to differences in biological characteristics and types, qualities and quantities of data among Pacifc salmon species and S MUs. We indicate the extent to which candidate LRP methods proposed here are aligned with these principles. Additional LRP methods may be developed in the future to capture a broader range of data availability, quality, and types, and/or dimensions of biological status; the development of these additional methods should be aligned with the key principles summarized here.\nIn the next section, methods for estimating CU status are described, as implemented in previous status assessments under the WSP, and candidate LRPs are proposed. Guidelines on how to choose among LRPs is described in Section 5.\n12\n\f4. PROPOSED LRP METHODS FOR PACIFIC SALMON\nLRP methods require assessments of status at the scale of CUs. Abundance data required for CU assessments are sometimes infuenced by hatchery enhancement, which requires additional considerations. This section includes recommended methods to derive CU-level statuses and estimates LRPs. Within CU status assessments, we frst describe our approach for accounting for hatchery enhancement.\n4.1. CONTRIBUTION OF HATCHERIES\nKEY POINTS:\n• While hatcheries are a useful tool for augmenting production for harvest and\nconservation, they can reduce wild genetic diversity and ftness and are considered a risk factor for the long-term persistence of CUs.\n• Salmon that are enhanced by hatcheries are not considered ’wild’ under the Wild\n•\nSalmon Policy and are not usually included in assessments of biological status. The data used to assess the contribution of hatcheries to spawning are associated with high uncertainties related to the tagging method used, sampling rates, uncertainty in survival of natural vs. hatchery-origin fsh, and observation errors.\n•\n• Populations dominated by wild fsh but infuenced by hatchery strays from outside of the basin are generally included in CU assessments, but these strays may bias estimates of natural production and resulting assessments. Following previous WSP status assessments, when data are available, the demographic infuence of hatchery production can be removed from time-series of abundances. This step applies to populations included in analyses, after removing populations with high hatchery infuence. Where data to differentiate hatchery- from natural-origin spawners are not available, total spawner abundances include hatchery-origin fsh, representing a key source of uncertainty for hatchery-infuenced populations.\n• Methods to process data on hatchery contributions within assessments and guidance\non best practices within DFO continue to evolve.\nHatcheries contribute to spawning abundances of many salmon populations and can be used as a conservation tool as well as a way to increase the availability of fsh for harvest. Hatcheries can also reduce wild genetic diversity and ftness, defned as adult-to-adult reproductive success, and are considered a risk factor for the long-term persistence of CUs (Withler et al. 2018). Salmon that are hatchery-origin, as well as their progeny, are not considered ‘wild’ under the Wild Salmon Policy. Typically, only populations dominated by wild salmon are included in assessments of biological status. However, separating out the infuence of hatcheries in time-series of spawner abundances and recruitment is challenging, in part because hatchery-origin salmon are often not marked, e.g., with fn clips or fsh tags, and so are indistinguishable from natural-origin spawners. Also, many salmon escapement programs, such as those where salmon spawners are counted from helicopters (Parken et al. 2003) do not have biological sampling programs to collect, mark and tag data from individual salmon.\n13\n\f4.1.1. Accounting for genetic risks of hatchery production\nFollowing Withler et al. (2018), we recommend including only populations without signifcant hatchery enhancement in analyses of CU and SMU biological status consistent with the WSP. Proportionate Natural Infuence, PNI, is a metric of the genetic risk of hatcheries on natural populations, with values &lt; 0.5 indicating integrated-hatchery populations, where more than half of spawners are hatchery origin, values ⩾ 0.5 and &lt; 0.72 indicating integrated-transition populations where natural-origin fsh predominate, and values ⩾ 0.72 indicating integrated-wild populations, where more than half of spawners are considered ‘wild’ under the WSP (Withler et al. 2018). While these guidelines were proposed for Chinook Salmon where hatchery enhancement is most common, they are also applicable to other salmon species (Withler et al. 2018).\nTable 1. Potential guidelines for the implementation of integrated hatchery populations in WSP assessments based on their biological designation and Proportionate Natural Infuence, PNI, taken from Withler et al. (2018).\nDesignation\nWild\nPNI\nna\nInclusion in WSP assessments\nYes\nWild-stray infuenced\nna\nProvisional\nIntegrated-wild\n≥ 0.72\nYes\nIntegrated-transition\n≥ 0.5, &lt; 0.72\nProvisional\nIntegrated-hatchery\n&lt; 0.5\nNo\nWhen assessing population status, Withler et al. (2018) recommend the inclusion of integrated- wild populations within biological assessments under the WSP, and provisionally, integrated- transition populations (i.e., PNI ⩾ 0.5 ). Accordingly, only populations with PNI values ⩾ 0.5 were included in the assessment of CU and SMU status in our case study applications. Stricter defnitions of hatchery enhancement can be considered by including only populations with PNI values ⩾ 0.72. In practice, applying this stricter threshold for our case study on Chinook Salmon resulted in excluding most data since reliable time-series of PNI values and spawner abundances are only available for exploitation-rate indicator populations, which tend to be populations with hatcheries. Adopting a threshold of ⩾ 0.5, a level associated with more than half of spawners being natural origin, was the result of a trade-off between assessing remaining CU-level biodiversity and excluding signifcant hatchery impacts. For some populations, early periods of high enhancement can be removed from time-series and assessments can focus on recent periods without signifcant enhancement (Grant et al. 2012). For hatcheries aimed at rebuilding critically depleted populations, production may be dominated by hatchery-origin fsh for a period until abundances are above lower conservation thresholds. Guidelines on the assessment and management of these conservation hatcheries are currently being developed by DFO’s Salmonid Enhancement Program, including regular assessments of the proportion of hatchery-origin spawning.\n14\n\fData used to assess hatchery contribution to spawning and estimate PNI values are associated with high uncertainties. For our case study on Chinook Salmon, proportions of hatchery-origin spawners were determined from spawning ground surveys for thermal marking on hatchery- origin salmon. When data on thermal marking were not available, coded-wire tags (CWTs) were used to identify hatchery-origin spawners, but were associated with increased uncertainty. Large interannual variability in the proportion of hatchery-origin spawners can result from natural variability in survival of hatchery- versus natural-origin spawners, low sampling rates for hatchery- origin spawners, and high observation errors, requiring decisions about temporal averaging. For the westcoast Vancouver Island Chinook case study, we averaged over the available time series where hatchery objectives have remained constant, though recommend further research quantifying the sources of uncertainties and evaluating the sensitivity of results to various time periods for averaging (e.g., recent generation versus entire time period).\nIn addition to guidance on biological assessments under the WSP, Withler et al. (2018) further recommend developing biological goals for hatchery-infuenced populations and documenting trade-offs between increased genetic risk to wild populations from hatchery production and increased abundance required to support other objectives. Enhancement plans are being developed for hatchery-infuenced populations by DFO’s Salmonid Enhancement Program, which include objectives related to PNI, harvest, assessment, and stewardship and measures to achieve objectives. Once developed, enhancement plans can be integrated with harvest and habitat planning within integrated management and/or rebuilding plans. Guidelines and methods for estimating PNI values are also being documented by DFO’s Salmonid Enhancement Program (DFO, In\n)3.\nprep.\n4.1.2. Wild populations infuenced by straying from hatcheries\nIn addition, Withler et al. (2018) recommend that populations dominated by wild fsh but infuenced by hatchery stays (called ‘wild stray-infuenced’ populations) should be included in CU assessments under the WSP. These populations receive strays from out-of-basin hatchery programs, but do not contain hatcheries themselves. Although the majority of fsh may be wild in these populations, one-way gene fow modelling suggests that over time PNI values will decline to levels consistent with hatchery-dominated systems with continued straying. In practice, straying from out-of-basin hatcheries and the genetic impacts are generally not monitored or assessed, and so out-of-basin strays are included in total abundances within biological assessments. However, this represents a gap in our knowledge of hatchery impacts and our ability to implement recommendations from Withler et al. (2018). Two exceptions are Candy and Beacham (2000) which describes patterns of straying of Chinook salmon in the Fraser watershed and Vancouver Island, and more thoroughly on the west coast of Vancouver Island where studies estimating the extent of straying for Chinook Salmon are on-going and may inform the evaluation of hatchery impacts in future biological assessments (W. Luedke pers. comm.).\n4.1.3. Removing the demographic infuence of hatchery production\nFor some WSP assessments that include integrated-transition and integrated-wild populations, the demographic infuence of hatchery production is removed from time-series of abundances when data on the proportion of hatchery- versus natural-origin fsh on the spawning grounds\n3DFO Enhanced Pacific Salmon on Wild Populations. Report of the Salmonid Enhancement Program, Vancouver, BC\nGuidelines for Calculating the Proportionate Natural Influence Index as a Metric of the Genetic .\nInfluence of .\nIn prep.\n15\n\fare available (e.g., from marking of hatchery-origin fsh or other data on the relative survival of hatchery-origin fsh, DFO 2015). Specifcally, the contribution of hatchery-origin production is removed from both the benchmark estimation and metric of spawner abundance. For stock- recruitment based benchmarks, the contribution of hatchery-origin fsh is removed from recruitment estimates but not escapement, as it is assumed that all natural spawners reproduce successfully in the wild and contribute to natural production. This way, the spawner-recruitment relationship represents the production derived from spawners in the natural environment. For the metric of spawner abundances, the contribution of hatchery-origin fsh can be removed from spawner time series to reduce the infuence of variability in annual hatchery production on status (DFO 2015). Although removing hatchery-origin fsh from analyses is inconsistent with the recommendation of Withler et al. (2018) to include all spawners in biological assessments when natural spawning predominates (PNI ⩾ 0.5), it is consistent with existing published WSP assessments on which our analyses relied and developing new time-series was beyond the scope of this study.\nIn most cases where hatchery-origin fsh are not marked or sampled on the spawning grounds, data on the proportion of hatchery-origin spawners are not available. In these cases, WSP assessments generally rely on total spawner abundances including hatchery contribution, as long as spawner abundances are believed to be predominantly natural origin (e.g., PNI ⩾ 0.5) (e.g., Southern BC Chinook Salmon, DFO 2016b), aligned with recommendations of Withler et al. (2018). In these cases, there may a risk of current status being confounded by hatchery production which may mask changes in natural production and obscure inferences for unenhanced populations in the CU. This risk is partly mediated but not eliminated by removing populations that are dominated by hatchery-origin fsh from assessments. In general, we recommend fexibility in addressing hatchery-infuenced populations in assessments as methods to process hatchery- origin fsh and associated guidance evolve.\n4.2. ESTIMATION OF CU STATUS\nKEY POINTS:\n• We recommend that CU-level status consider multiple metrics, either integrated\nthrough formal status assessments or through the Pacifc Salmon Status Scanner tool, also called the Salmon Scanner. The Salmon Scanner provides status from a composite of metrics and benchmarks on spawner abundances, and long- and short-term trends in spawner abundances.\n•\n• Various benchmarks on spawner abundances have been identifed to account for\ndifferences in data types, quantities and qualities among CUs, including those based on stock-recruitment relationships, percentiles of historical spawner abundances and freshwater spawning and rearing capacity.\n• Distributional metrics of spawning have been included in formal WSP assessments. • For the purposes of LRP development, CU statuses were derived in two ways: using multiple metrics applied within the Salmon Scanner and a single metric on spawner abundances to demonstrate the consistency in these approaches and highlight any differences.\nTo be consistent with the multidimensional approach to WSP status assessments described in Holt et al. (2009), we recommend that CU-level status consider multiple metrics, either integrated through formal status assessments (Grant and Pestal 2013; DFO 2015; DFO 2016b; Grant et al. 2020a) or through other multidimensional approaches like the Pacifc Salmon Status Scanner\n16\n\fprep.\n). In our case study applications Holt et al. (2023), we demonstrate the (Pestal et al. In application of the Pacifc Salmon Status Scanner tool as a way to rapidly approximate more detailed WSP status assessments. The Salmon Scanner (i) estimates statuses for individual WSP metrics and (ii) applies a decision tree algorithm to integrate multiple status estimates into a single status estimate (e.g., Red, Amber, Green) based on data type and availability. By using multiple metrics (Table 2), the Salmon Scanner allows for the assessment of status across a wide range of data availabilities. When data for a single metric are not available, other metrics can be used to inform status. The decision tree algorithm was verified with data and local expertise (Pestal et al. In incorporated into the application of this tool (S. Grant, pers. comm.). The Salmon Scanner can provide assessments under data limitations, and methods to account for resulting uncertainties from these data limitations are currently being integrated into the Scanner.\n). An expert review of rapid status results for each CU is intended to be\nprep.\nTable 2.

For data-rich CUs where spawner-recruitment relationships can be reliably estimated, Holt (2009) recommend a lower benchmark at the abundance resulting in recovery to spawner abundances at maximum sustained yield, SMSY, in one salmon generation under equilibrium conditions, Sgen. When applying stock-recruitment analyses, the spatial scale of density dependence should be carefully considered, which may be smaller or larger than the CU. Where recruitment time-series are not available and productivity is assumed to be moderate or high, and harvest rates moderate or low, specifed percentiles of observed spawner time-series (e.g., 25th) can be used as a proxy for spawner-recruitment benchmarks (Holt et al. 2018). For Chinook, Sockeye, and Coho Salmon where production is often limited by the quantity of freshwater habitat, equilibrium spawner abundances can be predicted from habitat characteristics to inform abundance-based benchmarks (Parken et al. 2006; Noble et al. 2015). For example, Parken et al. (2006) use the relationship between watershed area and spawner-\n17\n\frecruitment based reference points in a meta-analysis of Chinook Salmon populations from across the Pacifc region to predict reference points for Chinook populations without recruitment data. Also, information on freshwater habitat capacity can be used to develop informative priors for stock-recruitment benchmarks estimated with Bayesian techniques (e.g., Atlas et al. (2020) for Sockeye Salmon).\nSimilarly, metrics and benchmarks on long-term and short-term trends in spawner abundances are included in the Salmon Scanner. Long-term trends are measured by the ratio of recent generational geometric average spawner abundances relative to the long-term geometric average, and short-term trends are measured as the percent change in spawner abundances over 3 generations, the time period used in COSEWIC assessments (Holt 2009). Lower benchmarks on these metrics represent levels below which there is increased risk of extinction (Holt et al. 2009).\nIn addition, metrics on the distribution of spawning within a CU can be considered in WSP assessments (Peacock and Holt 2010; Peacock and Holt 2012; DFO 2016b), but may not be required for all salmon species and to-date have not been included in the Salmon Scanner. In one example, the distribution of spawners across spawning sites and contractions in that distribution over time were considered in a WSP assessment for southern BC Chinook (DFO 2016b). In addition, recovery targets for Interior Fraser Coho account for the distribution of spawners among sub- populations (Interior Fraser Coho Recovery Team 2006). One challenge to applying metrics on distribution is identifying benchmarks that distinguish populations with increased risk of extinction.\nFor the purposes of LRP development, CU statuses for case study applications were derived in two ways, using the multiple metrics applied within the Salmon Scanner and a single metric on spawner abundances. We applied both to demonstrate the consistency in these approaches and highlight any differences. When only a single metric is applied to derive status, there is a risk of providing a misleading assessment if other metrics that would have been used in a multidimensional approach provide contrary information, but are not included. A full review of the Salmon Scanner will be provided in Pestal et al. (In\n).\nprep.\n18\n\f4.3. LRP ESTIMATION\nKEY POINTS:\n• CU status-based LRPs are calculated from the proportion of CUs within an SMU that are assessed as being above Red status, with 100% as the recommended LRP.\n• CU status-based LRPs are recommended as the default approach for estimating LRPs\n•\n•\nfor Pacific salmon and triggering rebuilding plans under the Fisheries Act. LRPs along a gradient of aggregate SMU-level abundances (’aggregate abundance LRPs’) may be required for fisheries management decisions at the SMU scale, and are considered supplemental to CU status-based LRPs. Two types of aggregate abundance LRPs are identified: logistic regression LRPs and projection LRPs.\no\no\nBoth rely on the relationship between observed aggregate abundances and statuses of component CUs, but logistic regression LRPs rely on empirical data directly whereas projection LRPs are derived from projections of CU-level population dynamics, usually parameterized from empirical data. Both aggregate abundance LRPs are probabilistic in nature, identifying the aggregate abundances associated with an acceptable probability of all CUs achieving status above Red.\n• An assumption of the logistic regression LRPs is that the relationship between\naggregate abundance and CU-level status observed historically represents the current (and future) relationship. If the covariance in population dynamics among CUs is non-stationary, logistic regression LRPs may not represent levels above serious harm.\n• Projection LRPs can integrate plausible ranges of parameter uncertainties that may\ndiffer from those observed historically, unlike logistic regression LRPs.\nIn this section, LRPs that integrate statuses of component CUs are proposed. These LRPs fall into two categories: those based on the proportion of component CUs above the Red zone, called CU status-based LRPs, and those based on aggregate abundances, called aggregate abundance LRPs. Aggregate abundance LRPs are further subdivided into logistic regression LRPs and projection LRPs (Fig. 2). A more detailed description of LRPs is included in Holt et al. (2023).\nCU status-based LRP\nAggregate Abundance LRP\nLogistic Regression LRP\nProjection LRP\nFigure 2. Types of LRPs for Pacifc Salmon, showing the nested nature of logistic regression and projection LRPs within the category of aggregate abundance LRPs.\n19\n\f4.3.1. CU status-based LRPs\nCU status-based LRPs are calculated from the proportion of CUs within an SMU that are assessed as being above Red status (Fig. 3). To be consistent with the intent of the WSP to preserve biodiversity at the CU-level, we identify an LRP at 100% of CUs having status above Red (i.e., either Amber or Green). See Section 5 for a step-wise approach for identifying LRPs that further considers data limitations when identifying the proportion of CUs above the Red zone, and Section 6 for a description of associated uncertainties. CU statuses are derived using the approaches described in Section 4.2, and are submitted to peer review, as described in Section 5.\nAlignment with LRP Principles\nCU status-based LRPs can be based on the best available information (Principle 1) by incorporating multiple dimensions of status through formal, peer-reviewed WSP status assessments or the use of the Salmon Scanner with peer review. By using status derived from the annual implementation of the Salmon Scanner, relevant and timely information is used to inform status in a way that is transparent and open. CU status-based LRPs represent serious harm (Principle 2) as indicated by the status of any one component CU within the SMU being in the Red zone under the WSP, given that the deterioration of stock structure (i.e., loss of diversity) can itself be a form of serious harm. CU status-based LRPs are operational (Principle 3) because they are simple to calculate and communicate as a proportion of CU statuses. For SMUs where harvest is managed at the aggregate SMU scale, however, CU status-based LRPs are not easily incorporated into harvest control rules at that scale. Reliability of estimation (Principle 4) depends in part on the underlying data and is CU- and SMU-dependent. Uncertainties are not currently propagated from CU-level benchmarks and statuses from the Salmon Scanner, to LRPs and SMU statuses (Principle 5). CU status-based LRPs are well aligned with Principle 6, being derived directly from WSP metrics of status for CUs.\nA further advantage of this method is that it can easily be extended to other spatial scales under which Pacifc salmon are managed. For example, CUs can be assessed individually when threats and responses are localized to specifc watersheds, e.g., Cultus Sockeye which has unique threats to its spawning and rearing habitats. CU status can also be aggregated at various scales and across species when threats and responses are broader, e.g., for the management of numerous salmon species and CUs impacted by the Big Bar landslide reported in 2019.\nIn addition to CU status-based LRPs, we developed LRPs along a gradient of aggregate SMU- level abundance accounting for component CU-level statuses. These ‘aggregate abundance LRPs’ may be required for fsheries management decisions at the SMU scale, but are considered supplemental to CU status-based LRPs for the purposes of the Fish Stocks provisions. We identifed two types of aggregate abundance LRPs: (1) logistic regression LRPs and (2) projection LRPs (Fig. 2). Both LRPs rely on the relationship between observed aggregate abundances and statuses of the component CUs, but they differ in that logistic regression LRPs rely on empirical data directly, whereas projection LRPs are derived from projections of CU-level population dynamics usually parameterized from empirical data. Also, both LRPs are probabilistic in nature, identifying the aggregate abundances associated with an acceptable probability of all CUs achieving status above the Red zone. To an extent uncertainty in the underlying relationship between observed aggregate abundances and component CU-level statuses is represented in the probabilistic nature of these LRPs; larger uncertainties result in higher LRP values and vice versa, all else remaining equal. The ability of aggregate-abundance LRPs to reliably represent\n20\n\fthresholds of serious harm at the CU level depend on the strength of the underlying relationship between aggregate abundance and CU statuses as inferred from observed data.\nStock Management Unit A\nStock Management Unit B\nCU1 CU2 CU3 CU4\nCU5 CU6 CU7\nCU status- based LRP\nSMU status = below LRP\nSMU status = above LRP\nFigure 3. Schematic of ‘CU status-based LRP’ applied two example SMUs. ‘Stock Management Unit A’ (left) consists of four component CUs, of which two are Green status, one is Amber status, and one is Red status. ‘Stock Management Unit B’ (right) consists of three component CUs of which two are Green status and one is Amber status. ‘Stock Management Unit A’ would be assessed as below the LRP while ‘Stock Management Unit B’ would be assessed as above the LRP.\n4.3.2. Aggregate\nbundance LRPs\na\nLogistic regression LRPs\nLogistic regression LRPs can be derived from an empirically estimated relationship between CU-level statuses and aggregate SMU abundance. This method extends the CU status-based LRP by identifying the aggregate abundance level that has historically been associated with all component CUs having status above the Red zone, as approximated from status on a single metric of spawner abundances relative to a lower benchmark. For each year of observed data, SMU-level status is quantifed as a Bernoulli variable: 1 (success) = all CUs have estimated status greater than the lower benchmark and 0 (failure) = all CUs did not have status greater than the lower benchmark, i.e., at least one CU was assessed below the lower benchmark. A logistic regression is then ft to these outcomes to estimate the probability that all CUs have abundances above their lower benchmarks as a function of aggregate SMU-level spawner abundances. Given the difference in number of component CUs among salmon species (more for Sockeye Salmon than for other species), the likelihood of at least one component CU having Red status is greater for Sockeye. The following logistic regression equation is used to estimate LRPs,\nlog(\np 1 − p\n) = B0 + B1\ni=nCU s\nΣ i\nSi,t\n\n\n\nwhere, p is probability, B0 and B1 are estimated logistic regression parameters and Si,t is spawner abundance to CU i in year t. Equation 1 is then re-arranged to calculate the LRP as the aggregate ∗ spawner abundance associated with the pre-specifed probability threshold of p ,\nLRP =\nlog( p ∗ 1−p\n∗ ) − B0 B1\n21\n\n\n\n\fAn example logistic regression ft is shown in Figure 4, with LRPs associated with four probability thresholds, 0.5, 0.66, 0.90, 0.99, representing minimum levels above which probabilities are more likely than not, likely, very likely, and virtually certain, respectively, as defned by the International Panel on Climate Change, IPCC (Mastrandrea et al. 2010, Table 3). Mastrandrea et al. (2010) also highlight the range 33%-66% as representing ‘as likely as not’, encompassing probabilities slightly above even (50%-66%). The mid-point at 50% represents an equal probability that all CUs will be above Red status as there is that they will not. An additional consideration in this step is the probability threshold for triggering LRPs described in DFO’s Guidelines for the Implementation of Rebuilding Plans (DFO 2021d). These guidelines specify that, “unless otherwise defned in stock-specifc precautionary approach frameworks, the LRP should be considered breached if the terminal year stock status indicator is estimated to be at or below the LRP with a greater than 50% probability or if the projected stock status indicator falls below the LRP with a greater than 50% probability under a zero catch scenario in a 1 year projection”. While using a 50% probability threshold of one or more CUs having Red status is not directly analogous, in both cases the probability threshold chosen represents the probability of the stock avoiding serious harm.\nWe recommend positioning LRPs as thresholds with at least a 50% probability of all component CUs being above Red status, but do not recommend a specifc probability level above that minimum. Instead, we demonstrate LRPs under various choices of probability levels. Although LRPs are intended to be identifed by Science to represent the best scientifc estimate of the level below which serious harm is expected to occur (DFO 2021a) and without necessarily introducing additional precaution under uncertainty, there is no scientifc basis to choose one probability over others. We distinguish the biological basis of serious harm (any one CU having Red status) from the probability of this occurring, which implies a decision about risk tolerance.\nTable 3.

See our application to Interior Fraser Coho Salmon for an example Holt et al. (2023). We recommend evaluating the ft of the logistic regression prior to\nFigure 4. Logistic regression ft to annual Bernoulli data to predict the probability of all component CUs being above their lower benchmark (LBM) as a function of aggregate SMU abundance. Each black dot represents a year in the observed time series as a Bernoulli indicator showing whether the requirement of all CUs above their lower benchmark, LBM was met (success = 1) or not (failure = 0) as a function of aggregate spawning abundance to the SMU. The black solid line is the maximum likelihood model ft, and the grey shaded region shows the 95% confdence interval around the ft model. Coloured lines illustrate aggregate abundance LRPs for 4 different probability thresholds: p* = 0.5 (yellow), 0.66 (blue), 0.90 (green), and 0.99 (orange) probability that all component CUs are greater than their respective LBM. Horizontal dotted lines intersect the y-axis at each probability threshold, while the solid vertical lines show the corresponding aggregate escapement that will represent the LRP.\nthe development of LRPs to identify its reliability in determining serious harm to component CUs. Diagnostics commonly used for logistic regression of Bernoulli distributed data are provided in Holt et al. (2023). For example, diagnostics can evaluate the assumptions that, (a) aggregate abundances are linearly related to log-odds of all CUs being above their lower benchmarks, (b) observations are independent, and (c) there are no infuential outliers. In addition, the statistical signifcance of the predictor variable (aggregate abundance) and the goodness-of-ft of the logistic model can inform its reliability for determining LRPs. Furthermore, the classifcation accuracy of LRPs developed from a logistic regression can be evaluated on the observed data using a performance metric called the hit ratio. This ratio represents the proportion of successful classifcations above or below the logistic regression-derived LRP, relative to the total number classifcations or years. Out-of-sample cross-validation methods can also be applied so that model-based LRPs do not include the observed data used for evaluation in this performance metric.\nWe used a single metric of annual spawner abundances to approximate CU status when using the logistic regression approach, though WSP assessments generally use multiple metrics including trends in abundances and apply generational smoothing. Incorporating metrics on trends and smoothing abundance time-series prior to determining CU status introduces autocorrelation in observed CU statuses, violating the assumption of independent observations in the logistic\n23\n\fregression model. This creates a systematic difference in derivation of LRPs depending on how CU status is assessed. Future research could consider logistic regression models that include autocorrelated residuals to develop LRPs based on CU-statuses derived from multiple metrics (e.g., the Pacifc Salmon Status Scanner).\nOne advantage of logistic regression LRPs is that uncertainties in CU-level benchmarks and assessments can be accounted for explicitly. We used a statistically integrated estimation approach, where CU-level stock-recruitment models and associated CU-level benchmarks were estimated in the same model as the logistic regression and LRP derivation. In this way, the uncertainties from CU-level benchmarks and assessments were propagated through to the estimation of the LRP. While Bayesian estimation methods were not applied for the integrated logistic regression approach in any of our case study applications, this extension could be made in the future.\nIn addition, structural uncertainties in underlying assumptions such as the form of the spawner- recruitment relationship, can be addressed in at least three ways. First, the weight-of-evidence for various assumptions can be evaluated to identify the assumption with the most support, which is then used for LRP development. This can include relying on support for various model forms provided in previous stock assessments or from meta-analyses. Second, various assumptions can be provided as sensitivity analyses demonstrating the impact of assumptions about CU dynamics on LRP estimates and current status. Third, LRPs can be averaged by, for example, combining posterior probability estimates. When averaging, LRPs can be weighted according to the inverse of the variances, the strength of evidence for each hypothesis based on statistical criteria (e.g., AIC), retrospective performance, or expert opinion (Rossi et al. 2019; Jardim et al. 2021). A simple example of model-averaging, in which two alternative models were weighted equally, was demonstrated for projection LRPs in the Interior Fraser Coho case study. When model averaging, it is important to consider the plausibility of various models and the distribution of uncertain parameters (e.g., their variances and biases)(Millar et al. 2015; Dormann et al. 2018). It may be more appropriate to select one model instead of averaging over models when they provide competing hypotheses (i.e., bimodal distributions) with differing management implications (Millar et al. 2015).\nAlignment with LRP Principles\nLogistic regression LRPs do not use the best available information for CU statuses in all cases (Principle 1), because they use only one metric of spawner abundances omitting metrics on trends which may be especially informative in data-limited contexts. CUs that do not have abundance- based benchmarks are omitted from consideration of serious harm in this approach even when trends are available to estimate status. Also, logistic regression LRPs approximate CU status by comparing annual spawner abundances to benchmarks instead of generationally smoothed spawner abundances and so may capture random noise in abundance trends instead of true status that is likely autocorrelated over time. In some cases, status based on the single metric on spawner abundances may diverge from that based on multidimensional approaches, e.g., the Pacifc Salmon Status Scanner. Logistic regression LRPs are aligned with Principle 2 to the extent that serious harm is indicated by status of any one CU being in the Red zone under the WSP and that the estimated relationship between aggregate abundances and probability of all CUs being above their lower benchmark holds.\nLogistic regression LRPs are operational (Principle 3) when harvest management occurs at the aggregate level and requires aggregate abundance LRPs to inform management decisions. However, they are more diffcult to communicate being derived from model outputs, and they\n24\n\frequire the choice of probability of all CUs being above their lower benchmarks, which is diffcult to justify from a science perspective.\nReliability of estimation (Principle 4) depends on the reliability of underlying data and the ft of logistic regression as described by model diagnostics. One assumption of this method is that the relationship between aggregate abundance and CU-level status observed historically represents the current (and future) relationship. If the covariance in dynamics among CUs or relative productivities or capacities of CUs are non-stationary, a phenomenon that is increasingly common for Pacifc salmon, logistic regression LRPs may not reliably represent serious harm under current or future conditions. Furthermore, LRPs may be unreliable if harvest strategies change over time such that relative exploitation of CUs varies (e.g., due to shifts towards weak stock management or when exploitation varies with the abundance of other species). Uncertainties in CU status are accounted for explicitly when CU- and SMU-level models are statistically integrated, and confdence or credible intervals can provide quantitative measures of estimation uncertainty (Principle 5). Logistic regression LRPs are aligned with Principle 6 to the extent that aggregate abundances are an acceptably reliable predictor of CU level statuses, with the caveat that CU status on a single metric may deviate from the multidimensional approach recommended under the WSP.\nProjection LRPs\nSimilar to logistic regression LRPs, projection LRPs rely on the underlying relationship between aggregate abundances and status of component CUs. However, unlike logistic regression LRPs, the aggregate abundance where there is a specifed probability of all CUs being above their lower benchmarks is identifed from projections instead of directly from historical data.\nIn this approach, the population dynamics of individual CUs are projected with natural variability in population processes (e.g., recruitment and ages-at-maturity) and with covariance among CUs. Projections are done using current exploitation rates characterized with annual implementation uncertainty. Other exploitation scenarios can also be considered. Projections are run over an initialization period to remove the impacts of starting conditions, and then over multiple generations to identify aggregate abundances characterized by an equilibrium state where the distribution of abundances are stable. Projection LRPs are then estimated using these projected CU abundances to characterize the relationship between aggregate SMU-level spawner abundance and the probability that all CUs exceed their lower benchmarks (e.g., Sgen). For the SMUs we considered for our case studies, we approximated the management approach with constant exploitation rates with implementation error, though more realistic management procedures that include escapement goals and exploitation limits, or a fxed series of exploitation rates that vary with abundances could be considered in future iterations. As was done for logistic regression LRPs, status was estimated from a single metric rather than from the multidimensional approach within the Salmon Scanner.\nOne advantage of projection LRPs over logistic regression LRPs is that projections allow for explicit consideration of uncertainty in underlying assumptions about model parameters and the covariance among CUs by including those uncertainties as random components of the projections. Furthermore, unlike logistic regression LRPs, this method is not limited by historical data on CU status. To implement projection LRPs, we adapted a previously developed R package for performing closed-loop simulation modelling, samSim (Holt et al. 2020; Freshwater et al. 2020), as described in the Appendix to Holt et al. (2023) and provided online (see Appendix B).\n25\n\fAfter providing parameter distributions describing the CU-level population dynamics and exploitation to samSim, the projections included four main steps:\n\nProject spawner abundances forward for 30 years after an initialization period and over\n\nnT rial stochastic simulations, where nT rials was chosen to stabilize results. In preliminary analyses, we projected over 100 years and found similar results.\n\nFor each simulated year-trial combination after initialization, characterize abundances as\n\nfollows:\n• Assign aggregate SMU level spawner abundance for each year-trial combination to an\nabundance bin based on intervals of 200 fsh, e.g., 0:200, 201:400, 401:600, etc.\n• Determine whether all CUs for each year-trial combination were above their CU-level\nlower benchmarks on abundances, or not.\n\nFor each aggregate abundance bin, calculate the proportion for year-trial combinations\n\nwhere all CUs were above their lower benchmark relative to all year-trial combinations falling in that bin. These proportions are then plotted against the aggregated abundances for year bin (taken as the mid-point of the bin).\n\n\n\nIdentify the LRP as the mid-point of the aggregate abundance bin with a proportion of CUs above their lower benchmark that is closest to the desired probability threshold (e.g., 0.5, 0.66, 0.9, or 0.99).\nExamples of projection LRPs derived from the aggregate abundance of each bin plotted against the proportion of year-trial combinations where all CUs were above their lower benchmark are shown in Figure 5. The choice of 200 fsh bins was a trade-off between increasing smoothness of the curve with bins covering smaller range in aggregate abundances and computational limitations of small bins requiring a very large numbers of stochastic simulations to allow for a suffcient number of year-trial combinations within each bin to stabilize results. Also, for our case studies, 200 fsh was within the range of uncertainty in observed spawner abundances. Similar to logistic regression LRPs, the uncertainty in CU benchmarks and status are explicitly accounted for in projection LRPs when deriving the probability of all CUs being above their lower benchmarks. However, unlike logistic regression LRPs, there is no estimation uncertainty in projection LRPs because statistical model estimation is not required. Probabilities are derived directly from projections and underlying uncertainties are integrated directly into the overall probability. Therefore, confdence intervals are not provided.\nAlso, similar to logistic regression based LRPs, structural uncertainty in underlying population dynamics can be considered through sensitivity analyses or model averaging by combining results from stochastic random trials across those structural assumptions. See our implementation for Interior Fraser Coho Salmon in Holt et al. (2023) for more details.\nAlignment with LRP Principles\nAs for logistic regression LRPs, projection LRPs use only one metric (annual spawner abundances), and therefore do not necessarily use the best available information (Principle 1) if CU statuses can be estimated using other metrics. Also similar to logistic regression LRPs, projection LRPs represent levels above serious harm (Principle 2) as indicated by status of any one CU being in the Red zone under the WSP, given the projection-based relationship between aggregate abundances and probability of all CUs being above their lower benchmark.\n26\n\fFigure 5. Example of projected probability curve derived from projections over 30 years and 10,000 MC trials. The curve shows the projected proportions of year-trial combinations where all CUs were above their lower benchmark as a function of aggregate SMU abundance, where aggregate abundances are shown in bins of 200 fsh. Each dot in the curve represents a single combination of year and simulation trial. Coloured lines represent candidate LRPs calculated for 4 different probability thresholds, 0.5 (yellow), 0.66 (blue), 0.90 (green), and 0.99 (orange). Horizontal dotted lines intersect the y-axis at each probability threshold, while the solid vertical lines show the corresponding aggregate escapement that represents the LRP.\nAlso similar to logistic regression LRPs, projection LRPs are operational (Principle 3) when harvest management occurs at the aggregate SMU level and requires an aggregate abundance LRP to inform decisions. However, this form of LRP may be more diffcult to communicate being derived from projections under assumptions of equilibrium, and they require choosing the probability for all CUs being above their lower benchmarks, a choice that is diffcult to justify on purely a scientifc basis. Reliability of estimation (Principle 4) depends on the underlying parameter distributions and model structure capturing the plausible range of true underlying dynamics. As with logistic regression LRPs, uncertainties can be propagated from CU-level benchmarks and status to LRPs (Principle 5). Unlike logistic regression LRPs though, this method can also integrate plausible ranges or future expectations of parameter and structural uncertainties that may differ from those observed historically. Similar to logistic regression LRPs, projection LRPs are aligned with Principle 6 to the extent that aggregate abundances are a reliable predictor of CU level statuses, with the caveat that CU status on a single metric may deviate from the multidimensional approach recommended under the WSP. Similar to logistic regression-based LRPs, projection-based LRPs are aligned with Principle 6 to the extent that aggregate abundances are able to reliably predict CU-level statuses.\n27\n\f5. GUIDELINES FOR APPLYING LRPS\n5.1. STEPWISE APPROACH FOR SELECTING LRPS\nKEY POINTS:\n• We recommend a step-wise approach for developing LRPs that highlights the\nimportant steps, considerations and decisions when identifying LRPs. These steps form our guidelines on the choice and implementation of candidate LRP methods.\n• Step 1. Compile data • Step 2. Assess CU data defciencies • Step 3. Evaluate if data-defcient CUs be represented by CUs with data • Step 4. Identify what proportion of CUs above red status (among those with data) is\nrequired to avoid serious harm. We recommend 100% as the default.\n• Step 5. Assess SMU status relative to CU status-based LRP • Step 6. Peer-review status relative to CU status-based LRP • Step 7. Identify if aggregate abundance LRPs are required for fsheries management. • Step 8. If yes, estimate aggregate abundance LRPs and evaluate the extent to which\nunderlying assumptions are met.\n• Step 9. If yes, apply aggregate abundance LRPs to derive SMU-level status.\nWe recommend a step-wise approach for identifying LRPs, with the proportion of component CUs with status above Red as the default method (Fig. 6). This is the method recommended to meet the Fisheries Act requirement for LRPs, and being based on the biological unit of CU, can be applied to numerous aspects of salmon management, including hatchery, harvest, and habitat management. Aggregate abundance LRPs are presented as an option for cases in which they are required for fsheries management (e.g., locally or internationally), but are considered supplemental to the proportion of CUs with status above Red. The step-wise approach presented below considers data availability for candidate LRP methods and provides guidance when inconsistencies in status occur from applying multiple LRP methods. These steps can be adapted in the future as more methods are developed and/or these methods are further applied and evaluated across additional SMUs and contexts. These steps were developed to be consistent with the principles described in Section 3.\n5.1.1. Step 1: Data Compilation\nThe frst step is to compile CU-level data to support biological status assessments as described under the WSP (Holt et al. 2009; Holt et al. 2018). These data include (but are not limited to) time-series of spawner abundances, recruitment, hatchery contributions, productivity, and biological benchmarks on spawner abundances. This step generally includes aggregating data at the spawning site or stream level to the CU level.\nIn some cases, fner spatial scales than CU (e.g., watersheds or sub-populations within CUs) may be considered to defne serious harm to an SMU. Although CUs are the population unit of assessment and conservation required under the WSP, the distribution of spawning within CUs (e.g., among watersheds or sub-populations) can be an important component of status (Holt et al. 2009) and these fner scales can be considered when data or supporting information allows. Distribution is a commonly cited component of salmon viability and recovery (McElhany et al. 2000). When applied to the identifcation of recovery targets for Pacifc salmon, Bradford\n28\n\fFigure 6. Steps for setting LRPs and assessing status. Pale yellow boxes indicate those for estimating CU status-based LRPs. Blue boxes indicate those for aggregate abundance LRPs. White boxes indicate when aggregate abundance LRP methods are not recommended.\nand Wood (2004) defned the relevant scale of distribution in units of sub-populations that are demographically independent, where population dynamics of one sub-population is unlikely to affect the dynamics of another. Genetic exchange among sub-populations is expected to occur at greater rates than observed among CUs (or populations), and would likely exceed 10 effective migrants per generation. When applying these criteria to Interior Fraser River Coho salmon, Bradford and Wood (2004) defned sub-populations on the basis of large watersheds or lakes, or partial barriers to migration.\n29\n\fWe recommend that the decision on distribution and spatial scale of conservation for biological assessments be part of the peer-review process for CU and SMU assessments, and be based on biological principles of conservation and viability (McElhany et al. 2000; e.g., as reviewed in Bradford and Wood 2004).\nWithin this step, information on hatchery enhancement is used to identify populations where production is dominated by hatchery-origin fsh. These populations (identifed by PNI values &lt; 0.5, or expert opinion when data on the proportion of hatchery-origin spawners are not available) are generally excluded from analyses, while those that are dominated by natural-origin fsh (e.g., PNI values are ⩾ 0.5), are generally included (Withler et al. 2018). Further, where time- series of the proportion of hatchery-origin salmon on the spawning grounds are available and production is dominated by natural-origin fsh, these proportions can be used to generate time- series of natural-origin recruitment for benchmark estimation and natural-origin spawners for status assessment against benchmarks. When the infuence of hatchery production is removed in this way, the assessments are less sensitive to the presence of hatcheries and annual variation in hatchery practices.\nInflling among streams or spawning sites for years with missing data is commonly used when compiling CU-level spawner abundance series (e.g., see Grant et al. 2012; Brown et al. 2020). When inflled time series are used to estimate LRPs and monitor stock status relative to LRPs, consideration should be given to the scale at which inflling is done. If LRPs are based on maintaining CU-level diversity, inflling of missing data should generally not be based on escapements from outside of the CU. Inflling among CUs increases uncertainty and may provide misleading status for the CU being inflled, if CUs diverge in status and trends (see Step 3). In addition, hatchery enhancement should be carefully accounted for when inflling to avoid overestimating abundances when inflled numbers are based on sites that are artifcially enhanced and when enhancement levels vary during the time series.\n5.1.2. Step 2: Assessing CU Data Defciency\nSecond, CUs with data to support biological assessments are identifed; those without suffcient data are considered data defcient. CUs are assessed based on a variety of metrics including abundances and trends, and data requirements for these metrics vary. At a minimum, a CU must have an index of spawner abundance time-series. These data can be used to estimate trends over time against benchmarks that are common across CUs (Holt et al. 2009). For short-term trend analyses, data are considered insuffcient when they include less than half of available years in the last three generations or are of low quality representing only presence/absence. These criteria for trend detection are similar to criteria described in Brown et al. (2020) and applied to spawning sites of Chinook Salmon in Southern BC.\nIn addition, current spawner abundances can be compared to abundance-based benchmarks, where current spawner abundances are generally defned as the geometric average spawner abundances over the most recent generation. For this metric, at least one year of spawner abundances is required in the current generation to compare against benchmarks. CU-specifc benchmarks on spawner abundances can be derived from spawner-recruitment models, percentiles of spawner time-series, or habitat characteristics. Data requirements for benchmark estimation on spawner abundances differ according to the methods applied and are not explicitly defned here. Local biological expertise is required to review available data and benchmarks prior to assessments to identify data defciencies. For example, changes in environmental conditions\n30\n\fover time may result in historical data that are no longer representative of current conditions, resulting in data defciencies.\n5.1.3. Step 3: Determine whether status of data-defcient CUs can be inferred from CUs\nwith data\nThird, the extent to which status of data defcient CUs can be inferred from CUs with data is evaluated. By defnition, data defcient CUs do not have data on population dynamics to rigorously evaluate the extent to which other CUs with data could be used to represent their status, though information on threats and biological characteristics may be available. To infer status for data defcient CUs, at a minimum we recommend providing evidence that: (i) the threats impacting data defcient CUs are likely to be the same as for CUs with data and their magnitudes are similar, (ii) dominant environmental drivers are similar among CUs, e.g., as refected by the distribution of CUs across freshwater and marine ecosystems, (iii) biological characteristics, such as life-history type and dominant age-at-maturity of data-defcient CUs are represented in the CUs with data, and (iv) the carrying capacity of data defcient CUs is likely in the range of those represented by CUs with data. Evidence supporting these criteria should be clearly documented and reviewed by local experts. The burden of proof is to identify that data defcient CUs have similar properties to neighbouring CUs, with the default assumption that each CU represents unique biodiversity whose status and trends cannot be represented by other CUs. We provide an overview of the four criteria in Table 4 and describe each one in more detail below.\nTable 4. Criteria to evaluate CU representativeness within SMUs.\nCriteria\nRationale\nThreats\nCU-specifc threats may impact survival rates, growth, and/or reproductive success and therefore statuses and trends\nEnvironmental drivers\nCU-specifc climatic conditions may impact survival, growth, maturation, or reproductive success and hence status and trends, either due to environmental drivers themselves or the interaction of different environments with common anthropogenic threats\nExample sources of information\nPublished threats and habitat assessments by CU\nDistribution of Freshwater and and Marine Adaptive Zones (2), biogeolclimatic zones describing macroclimates, as in (3), habitat characteristics provided in CU-specifc stock assessments, Indigenous Knowledge\nExample characteristics\nEcosystem modifcations including water extraction, forestry, fres, agriculture, and development, fshing, pollution, aquaculture, and genetic impacts from hatcheries\nFreshwater: river gradient, connectivity, macroclimate of spawning and rearing habitat, hydrological regime (e.g., (1) for Chinook Salmon). Marine: upwelling, currents, productivity of nearshore environment at ocean entry\n31\n\fCriteria\nRationale\nLife-history characteristics\nCUs with the same life-history characteristics such as age- at-ocean-entry are more likely to overlap in spatial and temporal distribution and therefore respond similarly to common threats and environmental drivers compared to those with divergent characteristics\nExample characteristics\nLife-history type\n(stream vs ocean for Chinook Salmon), age- at-ocean entry, age- at-return, migration timing\nExample sources of information\nCU-specifc biological information from stock assessments, Indigenous Knowledge\nCarrying capacity\nPopulation size is related to the probability of dropping below critical conservation thresholds and hence vulnerability to threats and/or random perturbations\nSpawner abundances CU-specifc biological\ninformation from stock assessments, watershed size (4), Indigenous Knowledge\n\n(Beechie et al. 2006) (2) (Holtby and Ciruna 2007) (3) (Medinger and Pojar 1991) (4) (Parken et al. 2006)\n\nThreats are defined here as any human activity or process that causes harm, death, or behavioural changes to a species, or the destruction, degradation, and/or impairment of its habitat, to the extent that population-level effects occur (DFO 2014). CUs that are exposed to different threats in freshwater and marine environment within an SMU may diverge in biological characteristics such as survival, growth, and reproductive success and therefore statuses and trends.\nCUs can vary in their exposure to environmental conditions, related to variability in freshwater and marine ecosystems, macroclimate, and hydrology within an SMU. Although SMUs are usually defined to be spatially cohesive groups of CUs, differences in environmental conditions among neighbouring CUs can result in differences in status and trends.\nCUs with similar life-history characteristics are more likely to respond to common threats and environmental drivers in the same way compared to those with divergent characteristics. Differences in life-history characteristics have evolved among CUs as a consequence of exposure to different environmental conditions and food availability (e.g., Bourret et al. 2016). In some cases, SMUs have been defined to align CUs with similar life-histories (e.g., Fraser Chinook where SMUs are defined in part based on dominant ages at maturity and adult run timing). In other SMUs, CUs with various life-history types are combined based on their geographic location (e.g., the Mainland Inlet Chinook SMU which contains CUs with ocean- and stream-type fish).\nCUs with different carrying capacities may respond differently to similar threats. For example, very small CUs may be more vulnerable to moderate fishing pressure if abundances decline below critical conservation thresholds (e.g., 1500 fish, an abundance threshold within the Pacific Salmon Status Scanner), whereas larger CUs may be more resilient to common threats.\n32\n\fCovariation in intrinsic productivity is well documented among spatially proximate populations across Pacifc salmon species (Peterman et a l. 1998; Pyper et a l. 2002; Dorner et a l. 2018), providing some support for the use of data-rich CUs to inform CUs without data. In a meta- analysis of spawner time-series across Pacifc salmon species throughout BC using data extracted from the Pacifc Salmon Explorer Tool (Pacifc Salmon Foundation 2020), pairwise correlations in spawner abundances among CUs within SMUs tended to be positive (Appendix C, Fig. C.1).\nOverall, we suggest caution when representing SMU status with only a subset of CUs, and recommend evaluating and documenting the risks of incorrectly assigning status of data defcient CUs based on neighboring CUs. We also recommend further quantitative evaluation of these criteria using empirical data disaggregated into groups of CUs with similar environmental conditions, life-history types and management intensity, among other variables. These criteria are not meant to be prescriptive, but are intended to provide general guidelines for drawing inference for data defcient CUs.\nIf data-defcient CUs do not meet the criteria for inference from the remaining CUs within an SMU, we recommend collection of CU-level data to inform biological assessments. Data collection would therefore be prioritized for CUs that diverge in threats, environmental drivers, life-history characteristics and/or carrying capacities from neighbouring CUs.\n5.1.4. Step 4: What arm?\nh\nroportion of CUs\na\nbove r\ned\ns\ntatus is r\nequired to\na\nvoid\ns\nerious\np\nIn order to apply CU status-based LRPs, a lower limit on the proportion of CUs above Red status needs to be defned. DFO (2009a) indicates that LRPs are based on biological criteria identifed by Science, independent of management processes. Given the goal of the WSP is to protect the biodiversity of Pacifc salmon in part by maintaining CUs above lower biological benchmarks, we have identifed a threshold of 100% of CUs above Red status as an LRP that will avoid serious harm. Exceptions to this LRP may occur where there is uncertainty or misidentifcation in the delineation of CUs (e.g., as for some transboundary CUs, Holtby and Ciruna 2007) or CUs are designated extinct. Those CUs would be omitted from the total number of (extant) CUs within the SMU.\nThis step omits decisions about how to prioritize CUs for conservation given variability in their capacity to rebuild. For some CUs the potential for rebuilding to above the Red zone may be extremely low due to natural conditions or anthropogenic threats. For example, some CUs are naturally more vulnerable to threats because of their biological characteristics (e.g., limited habitat availability) placing them in the Red zone. However, that natural vulnerability does not diminish the serious harm associated with the biodiversity loss if that CU is lost. Rebuilding may also be limited due anthropogenic threats such as climate change. Recent vulnerability assessments indicate that many salmon populations will not be resilient to climate change in the coming decades (Crozier et al. 2019, 2021). These considerations can be identifed in rebuilding potential analyses to inform decisions about where resources should be allocated in any subsequent rebuilding plan that is developed (e.g., Carwardine et al. 2019).\nFurthermore, unlike many other marine fsheries, threats and management levers for Pacifc salmon extend beyond those associated with the fsheries that underlie the defnition of SMUs and LRPs. The scale of SMUs is often incongruent with the scale of dominant threats and management levers. As a result, LRPs based on 100% of CUs being above Red status may trigger the development of rebuilding plans under the Fish Stocks provisions when only a component (e.g., a single CU) requires intervention. Furthermore, the most appropriate CU-level interventions may not be\n33\n\frelated to harvest (e.g., hatcheries or habitat amelioration). Nevertheless, we have identifed 100% of CUs within the SMU should be above their benchmarks to avoid serious harm under the Fish Stocks provisions. Triggers and interventions at fner and coarser spatial scales will also be essential to sustain Pacific salmon.\n5.1.5. Step 5: Assess\ntatus\nr\ns\nelative to a CU status-based LRP\nWe recommend CU status-based LRPs as the default approach for identifying LRPs for Pacifc salmon. This method provides consistency with assessments previously published under the WSP (Grant and Pestal 2013; DFO 2015; DFO 2016b; Grant et al. 2020a) and allows for the evaluation of status at a hierarchy of scales relevant to salmon rebuilding .\nUsing this approach, the status of individual CUs is assessed and the proportion of CUs with status above Red is then compared to the LRP identifed from Step 4 . Where available, we recommend applying CU assessments from recent peer-reviewed WSP status assessments, in which multiple metrics, such as abundances and short- and long-term trends, are integrated to assign CU status within an expert-driven process (Holt et al. 2009; DFO 2015; DFO 2016b; Grant et al. 2020a). As a general guideline, we suggest that ‘recent’ should mean within the most recent generation, though major perturbations such as landslide events may make even recent assessments unrepresentative of current status.\nBecause formal, peer-reviewed WSP status assessments are resources-intensive processes involving large groups of experts over multiple days (Grant and Pestal 2013) and are not available for most CUs, we demonstrate the application of a tool to quickly determine status, the Pacific Salmon Status Scanner (Pestal et al. In status depends on a variety of population metrics, where the choice of metrics depends on data availability and may differ among CUs within an SMU. The Salmon Scanner integrates status on available metrics to derive an overall status that is comparable among CUs.\n). Within this multidimensional framework, CU\nprep.\nStatus of SMUs with data-defcient CUs\nCU status-based LRPs are considered breached when at least one CU has Red status regardless of whether the status of component data-defcient CUs can be inferred from data-rich CUs or not (Table 5, right column). A single CU with Red status can trigger a rebuilding plan under the Fish Stocks provisions since improved monitoring of data-defcient CUs alone will not result in an increase in SMU status to 100% (all CUs above Red status). Further monitoring of data-defcient CUs is still warranted in this case to inform status of remaining components of the SMU and associated rebuilding efforts.\nProvisional SMU status\nWhen data defcient CUs are represented by CUs with data we refer to the resulting status as ‘provisional’ if all CUs included in the assessment are above Red status (Table 5). This status has higher uncertainty and is therefore considered provisional until all component CUs can be assessed directly. In some cases natural variability alone may result in unassessed CUs having Red status even if the criteria listed for CU representativeness in Step 3 are met.\nData-defcient S MU status\nIn contrast, where data defcient CUs are not represented by CUs with data (i.e., criteria in Step 3 are not met), and all CUs included in the assessment are above Red status, then the SMU is\n34\n\fconsidered data defcient and SMU status cannot be evaluated. In this case, we recommend improved monitoring and assessment to fll CU-level assessment gaps.\nTable 5. Guidelines on assessing status for CU status-based LRPs of 100% of CUs being above Red status, when at least one CU is data-defcient\nStatus of data-rich CUs: all above Red status\nStatus of data-rich CUs: at least one Red status\nStatus of data-defcient CUs can be inferred from data- rich CUs\nProvisional SMU status above LRP with high uncertainty\nSMU status = below LRP\nStatus of data-defcient CUs cannot be inferred from data- rich CUs\nSMU Status = data defcient\nSMU status = below LRP\n5.1.6. Step 6: Peer-review of\ntatus r\ns\nelative to CU status-based LRP\nWe recommend peer-review of the CU data and assessments used in steps 1 (Data compilation), 2 (Assess CU data defciency) and 5 (Assess status relative to CU status-based LRP) if CU assessment are developed outside of an existing published, peer-reviewed process. Also, we recommend peer-review of decisions on SMU-scale aggregation from steps 3 (Representation of data-defcient CUs) and 4 (Proportion of CUs required to be above Red s tatus). This peer review can occur, at least in part, through DFO’s State of the Salmon Program’s annual implementation of the Pacifc Salmon Status S canner. The Salmon Scanner will be applied annually as part of a process integrating outputs with local expertise to provide statuses for CUs. Expert review is required to vet statuses derived from the application of the Salmon Scanner to ensure they are consistent with underlying biological categories given the multiple and sometimes conficting dimensions of status. The outputs from that process can be the basis for developing CU-level statuses to inform SMU-level LRPs. We emphasize the importance of documented, peer-review of LRPs and status assessments of SMUs prescribed under regulation, either as part the annual application of the Salmon Scanner or in any separate SMU-specifc peer-review p rocess. Peer review could be documented, for example, in a CSAS Research Document, CSAS Science Response, and/or CSAS Science Advice Report.\nThe frequency of SMU-scale peer reviews outside of the annual implementation of the Salmon Scanner will depend on variability in CU-level population dynamics over time and how LRPs and SMU-level assessments are used to inform decision making (e.g., if an SMU is batched under the Fisheries Act), among other factors. In the future, management procedures with various frequencies of assessments could be evaluated in a simulation framework to identify risks of delaying assessments relative to costs of implementing them.\n35\n\f5.1.7. Step 7: Are\nggregate\na\na\nbundance LRPs\nequired\nor\nf\nf\nr\nisheries\nanagement?\nm\nAlthough CU status-based LRPs may meet requirements under the Fish Stocks provisions for Pacifc salmon, abundance-based LRPs may be needed for fsheries management decisions (Section 2.2). For SMUs where harvest at the aggregate scale is a dominant driver of population dynamics and restricting fsheries harvest is a principal management lever, an LRP along the metric of SMU-level abundances may support precautionary management. For example, when LRPs are used to inform a harvest control rule, fshing pressure can be gradually curtailed as aggregate abundances decline towards the LRP to avoid depletion below that level. Aggregate abundance-based benchmarks may in some cases be required for local or international management. For example, aggregate escapement goals are required for Nass and Skeena Sockeye under Pacifc Salmon Treaty provisions (2019), although to comply with WSP objectives, the aggregate escapement goal must consider CU-level diversity.\nHowever, when LRPs are defned within the context of a Management Procedure framework (Section 2.2), then an aggregate abundance LRP may not be required if the framework can demonstrate the probability of individual CUs having status above Red for various management options. For Pacifc salmon, management procedures may extend beyond harvest control rules to include time-area closures, gear restrictions, habitat enhancement or hatchery supplementation to protect individual CUs. Therefore, the choice to develop an aggregate abundance LRP depends on the decision context, and should be made in collaboration with various sectors and First Nations responsible for management decisions that affect the SMU. If aggregate abundance LRPs are not required, assessment of the SMU would be provided from steps 1-6. The following steps (8-9) are relevant if aggregate abundance LRPs are required, and build on CU status- based LRPs derived in the previous steps. Uncertainties introduced by the inclusion of models to relate aggregate abundances to CU-level statuses should be considered when choosing LRP methods (Principle 5 in Section 3).\nIn the context described here, aggregate abundance LRPs are scientifcally derived quantities that delineate serious harm to an SMU following the principles outlined in Section 3. In particular, aggregate abundance LRPs are defned to be consistent with the WSP objective of maintaining biodiversity at the scale of CUs. Although these LRPs can inform harvest control rules, harvest management decisions require consideration of multiple objectives beyond those associated with conservation and serious harm (e.g., socioeconomic objectives).\n5.1.8. Step 8: Estimate\nggregate\na\na\nbundance LRPs\nWhat is an Acceptable Probability of CU Statuses Being Above Red?\nTo defne aggregate abundance LRPs, frst, an acceptable probability of having all component CU statuses above Red is identifed. While a 100% or nearly 100% probability of all component CUs being above Red may be desirable from a conservation perspective, inherent uncertainties in population dynamics make this choice impractical. Often, LRPs above the highest observed aggregate spawner abundances are required to achieve a near 100% probability of components being above Red status. Instead, we recommend applying a probability of at least 50% of all CUs being above Red status to align with WSP objectives. As outlined in Section 4, we provide LRPs associated with a range of probabilities, 50%, 66%, 90%, and 99% (where analytically possible) derived from categories of likelihoods used by the International Panel on Climate Change (Table 3, Mastrandrea et al. 2010), instead of specifying a single probability. We distinguish the probability of all CUs being above Red from the proportion of CUs above Red (identifed as 100% in Step 4). Both CU status-based and aggregate abundance LRPs are set at levels\n36\n\fwhere all CUs are above Red status, but aggregate abundance LRPs assign a probability to this occurrence.\nAlthough DFO’s Precautionary Approach Framework (2009) states that LRPs under the Fish Stocks provisions be identifed by Science, we were unable to identify a specifc probability level for all CUs being above Red status that aligned with scientifc p rinciples. Although it may be possible to select a probability level based on the IPCC likelihood categorization scheme (e.g., more likely than not, likely, very likely, virtually certain) further guidance on choosing among these options is required.\nChoose among aggregate abundance LRPs\nGuidelines for choosing among two types of aggregate abundance LRPs are described here: logistic regression LRPs and projection LRPs. These methods use either historical or projected data, respectively to identify the relationship between aggregate abundances and the probability that all CUs are above Red status. The guidelines presented at this step are based on the separate assumptions required for each method. If assumptions are not met for either method, then developing aggregate abundance LRPs that are aligned with the WSP may not be possible for the SMU.\nBoth methods rely on an assumption of positive covariation in population dynamics among component CUs. If this assumption is met, then when one CU has depleted status and contributes relatively few spawners to the aggregate, it is likely that other component CUs will also have depleted status contributing few spawners to the aggregate. Similarly, if one CU is considered healthy and contributes many spawners, other CUs are more likely to be healthy.\nGiven the range of uncertainties and limitations associated with each method, the application and comparison of both methods may be prudent instead of limiting analyses to a single approach (see Step 9).\nLogistic Regression LRPs\nEmpirical logistic regression LRPs are derived from historical time-series of the proportion of CUs above Red status, indicated by a single metric on spawner abundances or distribution.\nLRPs based on logistic regressions may be appropriate when the following assumptions are met:\n• CU assessments are derived primarily from abundances relative to benchmarks or distribution of spawners instead of time trends, or status on spawner abundances relative to benchmarks are considered a suitable approximation. It is possible to combine two or more types of abundance-based benchmarks to assess CUs within an SMU (e.g., use both percentile and Sgen benchmarks to assess different CUs).\n• As required for CU status-based LRPs, data-defcient CUs meet criteria outlined in Step 3\nsuch that their status can be represented by CUs with data.\n•\n•\nTime-series of the proportion of CUs above the lower benchmark contain contrast such that all CUs are above their lower benchmark in at least one year and at least one CU is below its lower benchmark in at least one year.\nThere is a statistically signifcant positive relationship between aggregate abundances and log-odds of all component CUs being above their lower benchmark without infuential outliers, as supported by model diagnostics described in Holt et al. (2023). This relationship\n37\n\ftends to be signifcant and positive when pairwise correlations in spawner abundances among CUs are strong and positive. For example, for our case study on Interior Fraser Coho, goodness-of-ft diagnostics identifed a signifcant relationship between aggregate abundances and log-odds of all component CUs being above their lower benchmarks (p&lt;0.01) and the average pairwise spawner correlations among CUs was relatively high, 0.56. In contrast, for our case study on Inside South Coast Chum, Oncorhynchus keta, the same goodness-of-ft diagnostic was not statistically signifcant (p=0.13) and average pairwise spawner correlations was relatively weak, 0.12.\n• Residuals for logistic regression model ft are independent (i.e., not temporally autocorrelated).\n• Environmental drivers and threats among CUs have remained stable over the available time- series, or have changed in the same way across CUs such that covariance in population dynamics among CUs is likely to have remained stable over time. As a result, the relationship between aggregate abundances and log-odds of all CUs being above lower benchmarks is also likely to have remained stable.\n• CU-level population dynamics are not undergoing directional changes resulting in declines\nor increases in population dynamic parameters and associated benchmarks.\nIn preliminary analyses for the Interior Fraser Coho case study, we considered CU status based on multidimensional status from the Salmon Scanner, but have chosen to focus on the single metric approach for several reasons. First, the Salmon Scanner includes status on smoothed abundance data (running generational geometric mean) relative to abundance-based benchmarks, and therefore the status in one year depends on the status in the previous year. Autocorrelation violates the assumption of independence of observations required in the logistic regression. Although logistic regressions can be revised to account for autocorrelated residuals, when autocorrelation is detected the available degrees of freedom are often insuffcient given the relatively short time- series of CU assessments. In addition, the Salmon Scanner includes metrics on short- and long- term trends in spawner abundances which are less directly related to, and may be completely unrelated to, aggregate abundances. For CUs that rely on time trends for status assessments, aggregate abundance-based metrics are likely not appropriate (see below).\nLRPs based on logistic regressions may not be appropriate when:\n• CU assessments are derived from trends in spawner abundances over time (e.g., as part of\nthe Salmon Scanner), and not abundance-based benchmarks.\n• Data-defcient CUs do not meet criteria outlined in Step 3 such that their status cannot be\nrepresented by CUs with data.\n•\n•\nTime-series of the proportion of CUs above their lower benchmarks lack contrast (i.e., are equal to 100% for all years, or less than 100% for all years).\nThe relationship between aggregate abundances and log-odds of all component CUs being above their lower benchmark is not statistically signifcant or contains infuential outliers. In other words, model diagnostics do not support the use of logistic regression.\n• Residuals for logistic regression model ft are temporally autocorrelated such that status in\none year depends on the status in the previous year.\n•\nThreats and/or environmental drivers have changed such that CU-level benchmarks estimated from historical data are no longer meaningful, and there is no expectation that these changes will revert naturally to their preexisting state, or be achievable through management. Or,\n38\n\fenvironmental drivers and threats among CUs have changed over the available time-series such that covariance in population dynamics among CUs is likely to have changed.\n•\nThere is only one CU in the SMU. In this case, the CU-level status represents the SMU-level status.\nProjection LRPs\nProjection LRPs are derived from projections of CU-level population dynamics and associated time-series of CUs above Red status as indicated by a single metric, spawner abundances relative to a lower benchmark. CU status derived from multidimensional assessments within the Salmon Scanner were not considered for projection LRPs because the projection model identifes long-term equilibrium aggregate abundances associated with specifed probabilities of component CUs being above lower benchmarks and is not structured to refect time trends. Time trends can be assessed in simulation models that evaluate the impacts of management procedures on population dynamics from current status, as in MSEs.\nProjection LRPs may be appropriate when:\n• CU-specifc stock assessment models have been developed including parameterization of spawner-recruitment models and the covariance in recruitment residuals among CUs. These models and their parameters account for hatchery contributions when populations are infuenced by hatcheries, are peer reviewed, and represent current dynamics of natural spawners and recruitment.\n• Where peer-reviewed population dynamics parameters are not available or are no longer current, plausible bounds can be placed on uncertain parameters (e.g., productivity and capacity), including those that may have changed over the time-series to represent a best- estimate of current conditions. These bounds can be derived from neighbouring CUs, meta- analyses, or expert opinion.\n•\nThese CU-specifc parameters are available for representative CUs within the SMU (as identifed in step 3)\nProjection LRPs may be inappropriate when:\n• Population dynamics parameters cannot be estimated, and/or plausible ranges are not\nknown.\n• Projection LRPs are used to evaluate status under a new management procedure that is not\nconsidered in the projection model. Projection LRPs depend on the specifc management procedure applied in the projections, implemented as a constant exploitation strategy for our case studies. However, sensitivity analyses of projection LRPs to various exploitation rates or management procedures can demonstrate aggregate abundances required to maintain CUs above their lower benchmarks under a variety of possible management scenarios, and the sensitivity of management choice to the aggregate abundance LRP.\n•\nThere is only one CU in the SMU. In this case, the CU-level status equates to the SMU-level status.\nFurthermore, projection LRPs may be more appropriate when pairwise correlations in spawner abundances among CUs are positive and strong, but this is not a requirement. It is possible to estimate projection LRPs for an SMU with component CUs that vary independently. However,\n39\n\fwhen correlations between CUs are low, the aggregate abundance LRP will be high because there is a higher probability of any one CU having Red status. In these cases, CU status-based LRPs and harvest control rules that manage CUs independently may be more appropriate. Although higher LRPs under asynchronous dynamics may initially be counter-intuitive due to the stability asynchrony provides to aggregate time-series (Schindler et al. 2010), independent trajectories among components increases risks of individual component CUs dropping below lower benchmarks in mixed-CU fsheries necessitating higher LRPs.\nModel evaluation for projection LRPs is more subjective than for logistic regression LRPs. The suitability of logistic regression model fts can be evaluated using statistical model ft diagnostics, which makes the evaluation process relatively objective and repeatable. However, the added assumptions and analytical decisions required to parameterize projection models is a more subjective process in which outcomes may vary among analysts. Peer review, as described in step 6 above, will be required to support the development of projection LRPs.\n5.1.9. Step 9: Apply aggregate abundance LRPs to derive SMU-level status and compare\nto status against CU status-based LRPs\nAggregate abundance methods are then applied to derive LRPs based on the guidance above. See Appendix A and Holt et al. (2023) for example applications. When status of an SMU is inferred from aggregate abundance LRPs using a subset of CUs that are considered representative of the remaining data-defcient CUs, then the resulting status should be considered ‘provisional’ (i.e., with increased uncertainty) until the status of all component CUs can be assessed. When status of data-defcient CUs cannot be inferred from data-rich CUs, status cannot be assessed with aggregate abundance LRPs.\nWe use generational mean spawner abundances as a basis for determining whether the SMU is above or below its LRP. A generational mean integrates status over cohorts within a generation, which are generally independent of each other because of the anadromous, semelparous life- history of Pacifc salmon and the dominance of a single age-at-maturity for many stocks (Holt et al. 2009; Porszt et al. 2012). As a result, generational smoothing reduces noise in annual CU status determination arising from both interannual variability in CU abundances from different cohorts and annual observation error in estimated spawner abundances. It also makes our determination of LRP status consistent with the approach taken for abundance-based benchmarks in published WSP assessments (e.g., Grant et al. 2020a) and the Salmon Scanner at the CU level. Further, we recommend that SMU status be evaluated approximately every salmon generation to align with guidance for generational CU assessments under the WSP (Grant and Pestal 2013; Grant et al. 2020a).\nCompare Aggregate Abundance LRPs\nUsing multiple analytical approaches to defne LRPs is consistent with the principle of using the best available information if evidence to support one method over the other is lacking. Statuses that converge among methods provide a stronger weight-of-evidence that the chosen LRP represents a level above where serious harm may occur. Although LRPs that converge may be based on assumptions that are coincidentally incorrect, the principle of Occam’s razor supports explanations with fewer exceptions. When LRPs diverge, the underlying assumptions causing those divergences should be explored and further reviewed.\n40\n\fCompare Status from Aggregate Abundance LRPs to that from CU status-based LRPs\nIn this step, we recommend comparing status from aggregate abundance LRPs to that obtained from CU status-based LRPs identifed in Step 5 . While aggregate abundance LRPs exploit observed covariation in population dynamics among component CUs, several factors can lead to a break-down in that relationship (e.g., observation errors, temporal variation in covariation, and/or infrequent extreme events). Hence, statuses from aggregate abundance LRPs may differ from those based on CU status-based LRPs. We recommend CU status-based LRPs as the default LRP to implement the Fish Stocks provisions, with aggregate abundance LRPs supplemental where required for harvest management purposes.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\n6.1. KEY UNCERTAINTIES THAT AFFECT LRP ESTIMATES\nKEY POINTS:\n• Uncertainties in CU-level benchmarks affect both CU status-based and aggregate\nabundance LRPs, and can arise because of: • observation errors in underlying data, e.g., related to uncertainty in the hatchery\ncontribution to spawning,\n• estimation uncertainty in benchmarks arising from statistical model ftting and\ntime-varying parameters, and\n• structural uncertainties in model forms.\n• Uncertainties can also arise in CU statuses due to the choice of metrics used (single or multidimensional). For both aggregate abundance LRPs, uncertainties can arise because CU-level status is based on only a single metric as a proxy for status on multiple dimensions. The distribution of spawning among populations within a CU can be important for the viability of the CU and SMU, and ignoring or misidentifying this stock structure may increase uncertainty in assessed status.\n•\n• Uncertainties in all the candidate LRPs can arise from the exclusion of data-limited\nCUs from analyses when these CUs are poorly represented by the data-rich CUs that are included. We recommend caution when applying LRPs that do not include all CUs.\n• Uncertainties in logistic regression LRPs arise from statistical estimation of the\nstock-recruitment and logistic regression models, as well as changes in population parameters and covariance among CUs over time.\n• Uncertainties in projection LRPs can arise from mis-specifying models used in the\n•\nprojections. For projection LRPs, uncertainties in underlying parameters and CU-level benchmarks are integrated into the probability of all CUs being above their lower benchmarks, and the LRP itself does not have statistical estimation uncertainty. Projection LRPs explicitly account for underlying uncertainties in population parameters, such as CU-level productivity and capacity, age-structure, covariance in recruitment deviations, and variability in implementation of exploitation strategies over time and among CUs.\n41\n\f6.1.1. CU assessments\nUncertainties in CU-level benchmarks affect both CU status-based and aggregate abundance LRPs, and arise because of observation errors in underlying data, estimation uncertainty in benchmarks, and structural uncertainties in model forms. Each of these three sources of uncertainty in benchmarks are described here.\nFirst, data uncertainties can arise from observation errors in spawner abundances, the proportion of hatchery-origin spawners, catches, stock assignment of catches, and age-at-maturity. These uncertainties impact estimates of recruitment in ‘run reconstructions’ and assessment of status.\nIn particular, the impact of hatcheries on spawner and recruitment time-series is a key uncertainty due to the low rates of marking hatchery salmon and sampling on the spawning grounds. Even when data on the proportion of hatchery-origin fsh are available and abundance time-series are adjusted to account for these (as in the Interior Fraser River Coho case study), the genetic impacts of hatcheries can perpetuate over multiple generations (Araki et al. 2009; Christie et al. 2014), and are diffcult to quantify because second generation hatchery-origin fsh are not marked or monitored. This is a source of uncertainty for populations impacted by within- basin (or within-population) hatchery facilities as well as those impacted by straying out-of- basin. Targeted marking and monitoring of spawning grounds for mark proportions and genetic analyses to identify genetic introgression from strays would help address these uncertainties. Further, for populations that are not dominated by hatchery production, the decision to exclude the contribution of hatchery-origin fsh from time-series of spawner abundances where possible assumes that these fsh do not contribute to assessment and resulting management of wild salmon, as in previous WSP assessments (e.g., DFO 2015), despite their possible contribution to conservation and rebuilding objectives, and ecosystem services in general. A review and evaluation of objectives for integrated-transition and integrated-wild populations (with PNI ⩾ 0.5), and the appropriate data on which to base assessments was beyond the scope of this project.\nSecond, in the estimation of benchmarks, statistical uncertainties can be represented with 95% confdence intervals derived analytically or with bootstrapping (or 95% credible intervals for Bayesian analyses). Short time-series or those with insuffcient contrast in spawner abundances can increase estimation uncertainties in benchmarks. For stock-recruitment based benchmarks in particular, observation errors in spawner abundances can bias benchmark estimates (‘errors- in-variables’), as can correlations that occur when the spawner abundance in a given year depends on recruitment in the previous generation (time-series biases, Walters and Martell 2004). Uncertainties in percentile-based benchmarks can arise because of uncertainties in productivity and harvest rates required to categorize populations for benchmark identifcation (as described in Holt et al. 2018). Uncertainties in benchmarks derived from the watershed-area model (Parken et al. 2006; Liermann et al. 2010) may arise due to its parameterization based on spawner-recruit data sets that are outdated (ending in 2000) and likely more productive compared with populations used in our case study. To address this last source of uncertainty, we derived productivity estimates and uncertainties from a life-stage specifc model for WCVI Chinook combined with expert opinion. All of these benchmarks may be biased when underlying population parameters change over time and these changes are not refected in the estimation procedure (see Section 6.3 for more details).\nThird, structural uncertainty in stock-recruitment models underlying benchmark estimation can swamp other sources of uncertainty, and requires careful consideration based on available data and biological understanding of the population dynamics, ideally with peer review. We provide one example of structural uncertainty in the Interior Fraser River Coho study based on\n42\n\fprior assumptions about population capacity, but other components, such as decisions about depensation at low abundances, shared or independent variability in productivity among CUs, and strength of over-compensation (e.g., Ricker versus Beverton-Holt) should be considered.\nIn addition to uncertainties in benchmarks, uncertainties can arise in estimated CU statuses due to assumptions made during status assessment. Uncertainty in status can result from the choice of metrics used (single or multidimensional). In some cases, status is best represented by a composite of multiple metrics resulting in uncertainties in status when only a single metric (e.g., spawner abundances) is applied. Furthermore, the distribution of spawning among populations within a CU can be important for the viability of the aggregate, and ignoring or misidentifying this stock structure may result in higher uncertainty in assessed status. Uncertainties can also arise from applying stock-recruitment based benchmarks to spatial scales that are larger or smaller than the scale at which density dependence occurs.\nUncertainties in peer-reviewed WSP assessments are captured qualitatively, as documented in narratives associated with each CU assessment (e.g., DFO 2015). These qualitative estimates of uncertainty are derived from experts who integrate uncertainties in data and benchmarks and often reconcile conficting m etrics. This process requires careful consideration of expertise included to ensure that best available information is incorporated in assessments and associated description of uncertainties. Although uncertainties in CU status derived from the Salmon Scanner are not currently provided, this functionality is being considered for future iterations of the tool. The Salmon Scanner will be applied annually within an expert-driven process led by DFO’s State of the Salmon Program, so underlying uncertainties are considered and outputs are verified. A full review of the Salmon Scanner including uncertainties is forthcoming (Pestal et al. In\n).\nprep.\n6.1.2. CU status-based LRPs\nUncertainties in status derived from CU status-based LRPs can arise from the exclusion of data-limited CUs from analyses when these CUs are poorly represented by the data-rich CUs that are included. To clearly communicate this uncertainty, we suggest labeling these LRPs as provisional when all the data-rich CUs have status above Red. Even when data-limited CUs have similar threats, environmental conditions and drivers, life-history characteristics and capacities as the data-rich CUs, population dynamics may diverge due to other processes that are not accounted for. We recommend caution when applying provisional LRPs that do not include direct information from all CUs. In these cases, we recommend implementing a monitoring program to inform CU-specifc assessments.\n6.1.3. Aggregate Abundance LRPs\nLogistic regression LRPs\nFor logistic regression LRPs, uncertainties can arise from statistical estimation of the stock- recruitment and logistic models. In our case studies, we provide 95% CIs and assess their overlap with current status. These CIs represent uncertainty in the estimation of the logistic regression incorporating uncertainty in the underlying benchmarks (e.g., from spawner-recruitment relationships or the watershed-area model). This occurs because the estimation of the logistic regression model was statistically integrated with the estimation of the underlying spawner- recruitment based benchmarks. This statistical integration allows uncertainties to be propagated from CU-level benchmarks to SMU-level LRPs. When estimated in a Bayesian framework, the probability distribution of LRPs can be generated to provide the probability that the current status is above the LRP given uncertainties in the LRP. In future analyses, uncertainty in current\n43\n\fspawner abundances could be integrated with uncertainty to derive probabilities of breaching LRPs that accounts for both sources.\nSimilar to CU status-based LRPs, uncertainties in logistic regression LRPs can arise from the exclusion of data-limited CUs from analyses when these CUs are not well represented by the data-rich CUs that are included. Further uncertainties in logistic regression LRPs can arise if the management system has changed over time such that selectivity from fsheries among CUs has diverged, or if the covariance in population dynamics has changed due to natural or other anthropogenic factors. In some cases, covariance among CUs may be driven by synchronous trends in hatchery enhancement creating misleading and possibly biased LRP estimates.\nFurthermore, uncertainties in both aggregate abundance LRPs (logistic regression and projection LRPs) can arise because these LRPs are derived from CU statuses on a single metric as a proxy for status on multiple dimensions. In some cases, these statuses may diverge because of additional metrics considered and the generationally smoothed time-series used to assess current status in the multidimensional approach (as implemented by the Salmon Scanner).\nProjection LRPs\nProjection LRPs explicitly account for underlying uncertainties in population and harvest parameters, such as CU-level productivity and capacity, age-structure, covariance in recruitment deviations, and variability in implementation of exploitation strategies over time and among CUs. The inclusion of structural uncertainty in the form of different stock-recruitment relationships is demonstrated for the case study on Interior Fraser Coho. We recommend a thorough review of assumptions and either including them directly in random sampling in projections or including them as sensitivity analyses.\nOne caveat of this approach is that the LRP depends on the management procedure applied in the projections, implemented as a constant exploitation strategy for our case studies. Although management procedures for Pacifc salmon often include escapement goals, fxed exploitation limits, and/or a fxed set of exploitation rates that vary with abundances, we have assumed that these procedures can be roughly approximated with a constant exploitation rate with implementation error. Other more realistic management procedures could be considered in future iterations. Projection LRPs derived in this way cannot be used to assess status when management procedures change over time and those changes have not been evaluated in projection.\nOne difference between projection and logistic regression LRPs is that for projection LRPs, uncertainties in all underlying parameters and CU-level benchmarks are integrated into the probability of all CUs being above their lower benchmarks, so that the LRP itself does not have statistical uncertainty associated with it. In contrast, 95% CIs associated with logistic regression LRPs account for estimation uncertainty not included in projection LRPs.\nWhen considering both logistic regression and projection LRPs under alternative model assumptions, such as different formulation of the stock-recruitment model, LRPs can be chosen based on strength of evidence for underlying assumptions or averaged when alternative assumptions are all equally plausible. Care should be taken when there is little or no overlap in the distribution of LRPs under various model assumptions, where averaging can obscure different plausible realities that would require alternative management actions.\n44\n\f6.2.\nIMPACT OF MISSING CUS ON SMU-LEVEL STATUS\nKEY POINTS:\n•\nFor CU status-based LRPs when an SMU contains data-deficient CUs and the remaining data-rich CUs are above Red Status, we recommend SMU status be either provisional (i.e., status with higher uncertainty) or data deficient.\no\no\nSMU status is provisional when data-rich CUs are deemed representative of data-deficient CUs SMU status is data-deficient when data-rich CUs are not representative of data-deficient CUs\n• Also for CU status-based LRPs, when any component CU has Red status, we\nrecommend SMU status be assessed as below the LRP regardless of the presence of data-deficient CUs and whether the status data-deficient CUs can be inferred from data-rich CUs. For aggregate abundance LRPs, we recommend that SMU status be provisional when SMUs contain data-deficient CUs that can be inferred from data-rich CUs, regardless of the status of the data-rich CUs.\n•\nFor CU status-based LRPs, we recommend SMU status be either provisional (i.e., status with higher uncertainty) or data defcient when an SMU contains data-defcient CUs and the remaining data-rich CUs are above Red Status. This recommendation is based on the potential for positive biases in status based on the data-rich CUs alone. Provisional status can be assigned to SMUs where the data-rich CUs are representative of data-defcient CUs (refecting high uncertainty in status), and data-defcient SMU status can be assigned where the data-rich CUs are not representative (Table 5). The power to detect a breach of a CU status-based LRP is relatively weak when the sample size of the data-rich CUs is small relative to the total number of component CUs. Therefore, statuses that rely on only a small number of CUs within an SMU tend to provide more optimistic status than those that include a larger sample of CUs for CU status-based LRPs, as shown for Inside South Coast Chum case study.\nIn contrast, if the LRP of 100% of CUs above Red status has been breached for an SMU with data-defcient CUs, the inclusion of additional CUs may further deplete or improve status defned as the percentage of CUs above Red status, but will not change the fact that the LRP has been breached. This asymmetrical impact of increased monitoring of CUs on SMU status may reduce incentives to extend monitoring to data-defcient CUs.\nFor aggregate abundance LRPs we recommend that SMU status be provisional when SMUs contain data-defcient CUs that can be represented by data-rich CUs regardless of the status of the data-rich CUs. For these LRPs, we found that removing component CUs from assessment of an SMU tended to increase variability in SMU-level status, which may be more pessimistic or optimistic than when all CUs are considered depending on which CU is removed and the level of covariation among CUs. For logistic regression LRPs in particular, the removal of CUs affects the ft of the logistic regression model, which impacts estimated status relative to LRPs in ways that are diffcult to predict a priori, as shown for the Interior Fraser Coho case study. In addition, for aggregate abundance LRPs we recommend data-defcient status for SMUs with component data-defcient CUs that cannot be inferred from the data-rich CUs.\n45\n\f6.3. FUTURE RESEARCH\nKEY POINTS:\n• We recommend future research be prioritized to evaluate the impacts of:\no\no\no\nTemporal trends in underlying population processes such as intrinsic productivity and carrying capacity on biological benchmarks and reference points. Adapting LRPs to include a broader scope for serious harm, including ecosystem and habitat considerations, the distribution of spawning within CUs, and Indigenous Knowledge. Simulation evaluation of LRP methods given temporal variability in population parameters and other sources of uncertainty.\nWe recommend future research on the impacts of time-varying parameters, adapting LRPs to include a broader scope for serious harm, and the evaluation of LRP methods, as described in more detail below. We highlight time-varying parameters due to their pervasiveness in Pacifc salmon population dynamics and documented impacts on reference points.\n6.3.1.\nTime-varying parameters and impacts on LRPs\nThere is increasing evidence of time-varying population processes in Pacifc salmon populations, particularly relating to trends in productivity (Peterman and Dorner 2012; Malick and Cox 2016; Dorner et al. 2018). In Canada, DFO assessments have identifed declines in productivity for various CUs, e.g., Fraser River Sockeye (Grant et al. 2012; Grant and Pestal 2013; Huang et al. 2021), Southern BC Chinook (DFO 2016b), and Interior Fraser River Coho (Arbeider et al. 2020). These assessments relied on a variety of tools to identify trends in productivity including the evaluation of trends in recruits per spawner (Arbeider et al. 2020) and residuals from recruitment curve fts (Grant et a l. 2012), and explicit consideration of time-varying parameters when ftting recruitment curves using Kalman flter or recursive Bayes approaches (Huang et a l. 2021). However, determining support for time-varying parameters is not always straightforward. Common statistical diagnosis such as inspection of residuals and use of information criteria (e.g., AIC and BIC) often produce conficting results (Holt and Michielsens 2 020). Evidence for changes in capacity over time are encountered less often in Pacifc salmon populations, but the potential impacts of time-varying capacity have been explored in simulation studies and may be important, although it is usually less impactful than changes in productivity (Holt 2010; Dorner et al. 2013). Changes in population demographics, such as size at age and age-at-maturity are also known to infuence population dynamics and reference p oints. Failure to track interannual changes in age-at-maturity can lead to biased stock-recruitment parameter estimates and underestimation of model variance (Bradford 1991; Zabel and Levin 2002).\nTime-varying recruitment parameters and population demographics affect estimates of salmon benchmarks, e.g., SMSY and Sgen (Holt and Michielsens 2020; Staton et al. 2021) and are also likely to affect population trends, resulting in changes to benchmarks based on historical observations (e.g., percentile-based benchmarks, Holt et al. 2018). Analytical methods for time-varying reference points have been proposed for other marine fsh species (A’mar et a l. 2009; Punt et a l. 2014), some of which have been evaluated empirically and in simulation with mixed results (Berger 2019; O’Leary et al. 2020). Berger (2019) suggests that dynamic reference points that track changes in underlying population processes are most useful in situations when stock productivity shifts directionally and the productivity signal is correctly ascertained. In contrast, uncertainty\n46\n\ffrom incorrectly identifying productivity trends can be a major source of inaccuracy in stock status (Berger 2019).\nAlthough evidence for time-varying population processes is strong, guidance on incorporating these changes into assessment and management of Pacifc salmon are lacking. In a review of stock-recruitment analyses for Pacifc salmon, Adkison (2021) highlighted that even when there is strong evidence for non-stationarity in population dynamics it is not clear if reference points should be adjusted accordingly. Where stock depletion is associated with time-varying parameters that are thought to be reversible, it may be more appropriate to protect the population from harvest by maintaining reference points using all historical data (DFO 2013; Szuwalski and Hollowed 2016). DFO (2006) recommended that changes to reference points should only occur when there is considerable evidence that productivity has changed and there are no expectations that these changes will be reverted naturally or achieved through management. Furthermore, DFO’s Precautionary Approach Framework states that “when developing reference points efforts should be made to take into consideration the range of factors which may affect the productivity of the stock including changes in ocean conditions, where information is available”(DFO 2009a). This information can help identify if reductions in productivity are likely to be reversible or only slowly reversible. Klaer et al. (2015) devised a framework for evaluating the degree of confdence in productivity shifts in Australian fsheries, and similar approaches could be adapted for Canadian salmon populations.\nEven if time-varying benchmarks or reference points are considered, it is diffcult to defne how often they should be changed (Zhang et al. 2021a). Mistimed changes in benchmarks or reference points may lead to biases in stock status and volatility of management responses may lead to management uncertainty, reducing trust in the management process (Adkison 2021). Recent studies recommend the use of case-specifc feedback simulation exercises in order to determine the appropriate scale to adjust reference points when stock-recruitment parameters are non- stationary (Holt and Michielsens 2020; O’Leary et al. 2020; Zhang et al. 2021b). However, full feedback simulation studies might not be feasible for every CU where trends are suspected due to limited resources.\nFurther research identifying when and how to account for time-varying parameters and demographics in assessments and management of Pacifc salmon is warranted, and is currently underway within DFO. Current WSP assessment methods do not consistently account for time-varying dynamics and their impacts on status and the resulting LRP estimates. Guidance on accounting for time-varying parameters that differ among CUs within an SMU is also warranted. Time- varying stock-recruitment dynamics usually occur at the CU level, and the implications for SMU- based LRPs that contain multiple CUs are not straightforward. There are no clear guidelines on how to translate time-varying stock-recruitment parameters for CUs into aggregate-level LRPs. Effects of time-varying CU recruitment dynamics on aggregate abundance and CU status- based LRPs will depend on the degree of synchrony among CUs, the direction of the change in recruitment parameters, and past and current stock status, among other factors. For example, in our case study on Interior Fraser River Coho Salmon, when a consistently lower productivity level was introduced through an alternative stock-recruitment model formulation (one that included informative priors on capacity in CU-level spawner-recruitment models), benchmarks increased for most CUs as did the aggregate abundance-based LRP for the SMU. However, in cases where productivity varies at different rates among CUs or capacity changes as well, impacts on CU- level benchmarks and SMU-level LRPs will not be easily predictable.\n47\n\f6.3.2.\nAdapting LRPs to include a broader scope of serious harm\nWe recommend future research into LRPs that consider the ecosystem component of serious harm for Pacifc salmon and include longer time frames for assessing thresholds of serious harm. The ecosystem component of serious harm could be considered by accounting for the importance of Pacifc salmon populations for marine ecosystems (Nelson et a l. 2019; Walters et al. 2020; Trochta and Branch 2021) and the impacts of salmon migration on the infow of marine- derived nutrients into freshwater and estuarine ecosystems (Schindler et al. 2003; Hocking and Reimchen 2006; Field and Reynolds 2011; Quinn et al. 2018). While the defnition of serious harm under DFO’s Precautionary Approach Framework encompasses impacts to the ecosystem, associated species and a long-term loss of fshing opportunities (DFO 2009a), the assessment of harm to these components depends to some extent on the time frame being considered. Assessments that include only very recent data may miss large declines in status and ecosystem impacts that occurred historically before the advent of modern survey records. In some cases, considering a longer view from genetic, archeological, palaeoecological, or Indigenous Knowledge has demonstrated that recent declines are part of much larger historical declines associated with large-scale ecosystem impacts (McKechnie et al. 2014; Eckert et al. 2018; Lee et al. 2019; Price et al. 2019).\nIndigenous Knowledge has been considered in the development of target reference points for fsheries management (Caddy and Mahon 1995), and there is value in further considering its role in identifying serious harm. Reid et al. (2021) introduce the concept of Two-Eyed Seeing (Etuaptmumk in Mi’kmaw), where both Indigenous and Western science perspectives are valued through the process of, “learning to see from one eye with the strengths of Indigenous knowledges and ways of knowing, and from the other eye with the strengths of mainstream knowledges and ways of knowing, and to use both these eyes together, for the beneft of a ll”. By investigating serious harm, reference points, and the time-varying nature of these concepts from both Indigenous and Western scientifc perspectives, LRPs may better refect biological processes underlying both knowledge systems. This step requires engagement and collaborate with Indigenous Peoples to co-lead and co-produce research on pairing Indigenous Knowledge with Western science-based LRPs.\nIn addition, the distribution of spawning within CUs is a component of CU assessments under the WSP, but robust metrics and benchmarks of distribution are lacking. Future research on assessment methods that more rigorously considering population structure within CUs would beneft both CU assessments under the WSP and assessments relevant to First Nations who often rely on salmon populations at relatively fne spatial scales.\nAlternative LRP methods may be developed in the future to capture a broader range of data availability, quality, and types, and dimensions of biological status, aligned with the key principles in Section 3. As methods are developed and revised, SMU statuses can also be updated in accordance with Principle 1, using the best available information for the development of LRPs.\n6.3.3.\nEvaluation of LRP methods\nWe recommend further consideration and evaluation of the four proposed criteria to identify if data-limited CUs can be inferred by data-rich CUs (Step 3, Section 5). For example, these criteria (and/or other considerations) could be applied to SMUs where CU statuses are available to assess the extent to which statuses covary when CUs are deemed representative of each other. Simulation evaluation could further evaluate the extent to which CU statuses on a single\n48\n\fmetric of status covary under a range of plausible underlying covariance structures in recruitment, age-at-maturity, and exploitation rates.\nIn addition, we recommend simulation evaluation of logistic regression LRPs and projection LRPs to assess impacts of data limitations related to the number of CUs with data and assumptions about population dynamics and covariance among CUs. We recommend that these evaluations be parameterized to the SMUs where their application is proposed to ensure results are relevant to the specifc context under consideration.\nWhen applying methods to specifc case studies, we recommend that aggregate abundance LRPs consider major structural uncertainties either through sensitivity analyses or model ensemble approaches. These analyses can determine how sensitive aggregate abundance LRPs are to key model uncertainties, including those related to time-varying parameters, depensation at low abundances, observation errors, and covariance in both population dynamics and vulnerability to harvest. We emphasize the critical importance of this step considering a wide range of hypotheses about underlying dynamics. Indeed, standard stock-recruitment models may have limited use if they do not capture the dynamics currently observed. In addition, we recommend simulation evaluation to assess the robustness of LRPs to violating underlying analytical assumptions. Simulation evaluation could further be used to assess the frequency of updates to LRPs required to achieve objectives given underlying changes in model parameters and structure.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nWe gratefully acknowledge the considerable support provided by our Technical Working Group on Salmon LRPs over the three years leading up to this review, who are (alphabetical order by last name, excluding co-authors): Michael Arbeider, Jessy Bokvist, Nicholas Brown, Charmaine Carr-Harris, Kelsey Campbell, Steve Cox-Rogers, Sabrina Crowley, Shaun Davies, Brooke Davis, Diana Dobson, Michael Folkes Aaron Foos, Nicole Frederickson, Wilf Luedke, Diana McHugh, Pete Nicklin, Chuck Parken, Candace Picco, Mike Staley, Pieter Van Will, Antonio Velez-Espino, and Ryan Whitmore.\nWe especially thank the contributions of the First Nations members of the Technical Working Group who brought unique perspectives and insights to our discussions.\nThe State of the Salmon Program, led by Sue Grant, provided helpful leadership and guidance on the Pacifc Salmon Status Scanner.

CASE STUDIES\nWe illustrate the application of the candidate methods for LRPs developed in Section 4 to three SMUs as case studies, evaluate sensitivity of LRPs to various assumptions, and use these applications to inform the guidelines presented in Section 5. The case studies included Interior Fraser River Coho Salmon, West Coast Vancouver Island (WCVI) Chinook Salmon, and Inside South Coast Chum Salmon (excluding Fraser River CUs), each comprised of 3-7 component CUs. These SMUs were chosen because they spanned a wide range of data types and availabilities from data-rich (Interior Fraser River Coho) to data-limited (Inside South Coast Chum). Furthermore, they varied in hatchery contributions from high (WCVI Chinook) to relatively low (Interior Fraser River Coho and Inside South Coast Chum), and two of these case studies are included in the proposed frst batch of stocks to be put under regulation for the Fish Stocks provisions (Interior Fraser River Coho and WCVI Chinook). For each case study, the set of LRP methods considered is a function of available data and previously developed assessment methods for component CUs. In this section, we provide a brief description of each case study and methods applied to each. For more complete descriptions of case studies, including SMU characteristics, data sources, analysis methods, and results, see Holt et al. (2023).\nA.1.\nINTERIOR FRASER RIVER COHO\nThe Interior Fraser Coho Salmon Stock Management Unit (SMU) includes Coho Salmon that spawn in the Fraser River and tributaries upstream of Hells Gate in the Fraser Canyon. This SMU consists of 5 CUs: Middle Fraser, Fraser Canyon, Lower Thompson, North Thompson, and South Thompson (DFO 2015). Declines in Interior Fraser Coho spawner abundance throughout the 1990’s led to a suite of management actions to promote recovery, including signifcant fshery restrictions starting in 1998 (Decker et al. 2014). Previous work by the Interior Fraser Coho Recovery Team (IFCRT) identifed 11 subpopulations nested within the fve CUs, and developed recovery objectives based on maintaining abundances of each sub-population above conservation thresholds (Interior Fraser Coho Recovery Team 2006). In 2014, a peer-reviewed WSP status assessment classifed three of these CUs as being amber status (Middle Fraser, Fraser Canyon, South Thompson) and the remaining two CUs as amber/green status (Lower Thompson, North Thompson) (DFO 2015). As part of the WSP assessment, Sgen was estimated for each CU and used as one of several benchmarks considered when determining integrated CU status.\nWe used data on total annual spawner abundances, recruitment by age (from natural spawning), and hatchery-based smolt-to-adult survival rate indices covering return years 1998-2020 to derive CU-level spawner-recruitment based benchmarks. Data on natural-origin spawner abundances at each of the 11 sub-populations summed to CU level were used to assess status and trends at the CU level for CU status-based and logistic regression LRPs. These data, along with exploitation rates were used to parameterize the projection model for projection LRPs. Hatchery contribution to production was usually small in this SMU, with PNI values &gt;0.5, and usually &gt;0.72. Spawner abundances are positively correlated among CUs, with an average correlation of 0.56 (Figure A.1). We characterized CU status in three ways, using: (1) the Pacifc Salmon Status Scanner, (2) CU- level abundances relative to Sgen as a lower benchmark on abundance derived from spawner- recruitment relationship under the WSP, and (3) the distribution of spawning abundance relative to distributional targets developed by the IFCRT (Interior Fraser Coho Recovery Team 2006). In the second approach, we further considered two structural assumptions about the spawner- recruitment relationship based on Korman et al. (2019) and Arbeider et al. (2020), which related\n60\n\fFigure A.1. Distribution of correlations in spawner abundances among CUs (or inlets for WCVI Chinook) for the three case studies\nto the strength of density dependence. The third approach recognizes that an adequate distribution of spawners across subpopulations may be required for long-term persistence of the SMU (Interior Fraser Coho Recovery Team 2006), and that a contraction of that distribution may represent increased risk of extinction (Arbeider et al. 2020). While multidimensional approaches, such as the Pacifc Salmon Status Scanner are recommended for WSP assessments (Holt et al. 2009), we applied the other two approaches (2) and (3) to support the development of aggregate abundance LRPs and for a point of comparison with the Salmon Scanner. Even though aggregate abundance LRPs are not required for harvest management of this SMU, we provide logistic regression and projection LRPs for demonstration purposes. Fisheries on Interior Fraser Coho are managed under a bilateral Canada/US management regime, detailed in Annex IV Chapter 5 of the Pacifc Salmon Treaty.\nFor this SMU, we evaluated the sensitivity of LRPs based on aggregate abundances to data availability with a retrospective analysis by re-estimating CU-level benchmarks, CU statuses, and SMU-level LRPs each year using only the data prior to that year. We also implemented a sensitivity analysis where one or two CUs were removed from the analyses iteratively and CU- level benchmarks, CU statuses, SMU-level LRPs, and SMU-level statuses were re-estimated. We further ran sensitivity analyses related to structural assumptions about the stock-recruitment relationship when deriving CU-level benchmarks for CU status-based and aggregate abundance LRP methods.\nWe found that LRPs and resulting status were most sensitive to structural assumptions about the shape of the stock-recruitment relationship. LRPs were less sensitive to LRP methods or CU assessment approach (Pacifc Salmon Status Scanner versus single-metric on spawner\n61\n\fabundances versus single metric on distribution) or the addition of more years or CUs of data. However, we note that for logistic regression LRPs, the exclusion of CUs resulted in larger uncertainties in SMU-level status, though the 95% CIs of status usually overlapped with the status estimated using all the data.\nFor this case study, we further demonstrated the approach of averaging over structural uncertainties to provide a projection LRP that accounts for that uncertainty. Similar averaging is also possible for logistic regression LRPs.\nA.2. WEST COAST VANCOUVER ISLAND CHINOOK\nThe WCVI Chinook SMU consists of three CUs (Holtby and Ciruna 2007), seven large inlets (or sounds), and 20 escapement indicator populations distributed across the seven inlets and three CUs. Escapement indicator populations are those with relatively complete time-series of spawner abundances with consistent observation methodology (Riddell et al. 2002; Pacifc Salmon Commission Sentinel Stocks Committee 2018). Hatchery enhancement is a substantial component of many of these populations, however, only escapement indicator populations without signifcant hatchery enhancement (PNI ⩾ 0.5) were included in our analyses (see Section 4). Because time-series of the proportion of hatchery-origin spawners are not available for these populations, total spawner abundances were used in the assessment of CU and aggregate SMU level statuses, which may result in overly optimistic assessments of status relative to analyses excluding hatchery-origin fsh (as in the Interior Fraser River Coho case study). Spawner abundances tend to be positively correlated among inlets within the SMU, with an average correlation of 0.28 (Figure A.1).\nFor WCVI Chinook, inlets nested within CUs are considered an important spatial scale of biodiversity given the geographic separation of spawning habitats among inlets, and limited straying observed among inlets (D. McHugh pers. comm. DFO South Coast Stock Assessment). We therefore considered spawner abundances at the scale of inlets within CUs because of expected limited demographic exchange at this spatial scale.\nTwo of the three CUs in this SMU, WCVI-South and WCVI-Nootka & Kyuquot, were assessed as Red status in a recent integrated Wild Salmon Policy assessment (DFO 2016b). WCVI Chinook was identifed as a stock of concern in the 2021 Integrated Fisheries Management Plan (IFMP) and a rebuilding plan is under development (DFO 2021e). Poor smolt-to-age-2 survival for WCVI Chinook and low spawner levels over the past two decades were highlighted as reasons for conservation concern in the IFMP (DFO 2021e).\nBiological benchmarks have been estimated for WCVI indicator populations using an empirical relationship between watershed area and two stock-recruitment biological benchmarks, SREP (spawner abundances at replacement) and SMSY, based on a meta-analysis of 25 Chinook stocks across North America (Parken et al. 2006). Lack of rigorous recruitment data for WCVI Chinook stocks precludes the use of stock-recruitment based benchmarks. For the development of LRPs for WCVI Chinook, the empirical relationship between watershed area and SREP was re-estimated using a hierarchical Bayesian model (as in Liermann et al. 2010), and applied to WCVI Chinook inlets.\nWe characterized CU status in two ways for this case study, using: (1) the Pacifc Salmon Status Scanner, (2) CU-level abundances relative to Sgen derived from watershed-area model estimates of SREP and productivity derived from a life-stage specifc survival model with expert opinion. We calculated two types of LRPs: CU status-based LRPs and projection LRPs. Based on CU-level\n62\n\fassessments, there were no years in the historical data where all CUs were above the Red zone, so it was not possible to identify logistic regression LRPs. Even though aggregate abundance LRPs are not required for harvest management of this SMU, we provide projection LRPs for illustrative purposes. Fisheries are managed based on a combination of the bilateral Canada-US management regime specifed under the Pacifc Salmon Treaty and local co-governance. We implemented sensitivity analyses on projection LRPs across two key uncertainties: variability in exploitation among inlets and intrinsic productivity. Further analyses exploring impacts of exploitation, variability in intrinsic productivity, and capacity are provided in Appendix D of Holt et al. (2023).\nWe found that status was consistent across the LRP methods that were available, and with a previously published assessment. However, projection LRPs were highly sensitive to underlying population productivities. Although the base-case LRP assumes a relatively diffuse distribution of productivities aligned with the range of expert opinion, reductions (by 25%) or increases (by 50%) in productivities among inlets resulted in relatively large changes in LRPs estimates.\nA.3.\nINSIDE SOUTH COAST CHUM - NON-FRASER\nThe Inside South Coast Chum - Non-Fraser SMU (hereafter ISC Chum) includes seven CUs of chum salmon from rivers that drain into Johnstone Strait and the Salish Sea along the mainland of British Columbia and the east coast of Vancouver Island. Chum salmon CUs spawning in the Fraser River watershed are excluded from this SMU as they have been categorized as a separate SMU (Inside South Coast Chum - Fraser). While these two SMUs have substantial overlap in ocean fsheries, they have been separated into two SMUs based on differences in terminal fsheries and freshwater habitats. Godbout et al. (2004) identifed variable but stable status in the central and southern portions of this SMU, with declines in the north, especially in the region defned by the Southern Coastal Streams CU component. Holt et al. (2018) found similar results in a provisional WSP assessment of status. Spawner abundances tend to be only very weakly correlated among CUs for this SMU, with an average correlation of 0.12 (Figure A.1).\nThe ISC Chum SMU is considered data-limited. While escapement time series are available for many streams starting in 1953, several series are incomplete and require inflling assumptions in order to produce a standardized data set over the full length of the time series. The quality of recruitment data is not suffcient to reliably estimate parameters from stock-recruit relationships for use in stock-recruitment benchmarks. Instead, benchmarks were calculated as a percentile of the historical CU-level spawner abundance time series (percentile benchmarks) to inform WSP status, as recommended by Holt et al. (2018). We removed three systems with high levels of enhancement from the Georgia Strait CU (one with large hatchery production and two with extensive artifcial spawning channels). The remaining systems had a mix of relatively small hatchery production or no hatchery production (see Lynch et al. 2020). Where available, annual estimates of hatchery-origin spawners were removed from total spawner abundances.\nFor this case study, we consider two approaches for characterizing CU status: (1) the Pacifc Salmon Status Scanner and (2) a single-metric on spawner abundances using percentile-based benchmarks. We applied both the CU status-based LRP and logistic regression LRPs to this case study and evaluated the sensitivity of SMU-level status from CU status-based LRPs to various data inputs. We were not able to generate reliable logistic regression LRPs for this SMU because logistic regression models did not ft the data well, as shown by model diagnostics.\n63\n\fWe found that assessments based on the Pacifc Salmon Status Scanner gave identical results to the single-metric on spawner abundances relative to percentile-based benchmarks. Also, as for Interior Fraser River Coho, increasing the number of CUs included in analyses always resulted in more pessimistic statuses relative to the LRP.\n64\n\fAPPENDIX B.

META-ANALYSIS OF CORRELATIONS IN SPAWNER ABUNDANCES AMONG CUS WITHIN SMUS\nFigure C.1. Distribution of mean pairwise correlations between CUs for 40 SMUs of Pacifc salmon arrange by species. Points are scaled to the number of CUs within a SMU with the largest point equal to 25 CUs.\nIn a meta-analysis of spawner time-series across Pacifc salmon species throughout BC, pairwise correlations in spawner abundances among CUs within SMUs tended to be positive for Pink, Chum, Coho, and Sockeye Salmon. For Chinook Salmon, correlations were more variable among CUs and sometimes negative, in part due to the confounding infuence of hatchery production in some of those systems. A pervasive problem with correlation analyses for Pacifc salmon is that populations with available time-series tend to be more heavily managed or suitable for less expensive spawner surveys, and may not represent those without data which tend to be remote, expensive for spawner surveys, and without direct management interventions. Data are taken from the Pacifc Salmon Explorer, provided by E. Hertz (Pacifc Salmon Foundation, July 2020). A link to the Github repository containing code to perform these analyses are provided in Appendix B.\n66"

As our community gains experience, we expect to refine and evolve them.\n\n\n\nScope (this guide):\n\nHow to do things (operational guidance)\nStandards and patterns (naming conventions, required annotations)\nQuality checklists (what to check before submitting)\nTool usage (Protégé, ROBOT commands)\nModeling patterns (measurements, hierarchies, evidence, provenance)\nWorkflow processes (how to contribute, review)\n\nADRs are for: why decisions were made, alternatives considered, high‑level strategy, technology/structural choices.\nStandards compliance: We strictly adhere to OWL 2 DL, and support SKOS 1.2 and RDF 1.2.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor experienced contributors who need a quick reference:\n\n\n\nLabel: rdfs:label \"Human Name\"@en\nDefinition: rdfs:comment \"1–2 sentence definition.\"@en\nSource: rdfs:isDefinedBy &lt;https://w3id.org/dfo/salmon&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nClasses: PascalCase (e.g., EscapementMeasurement)\nProperties: lowerCamelCase (e.g., aboutStock, usesMethod)\nSKOS Concepts: PascalCase (e.g., SonarCounting)\n\n\n\n\n\nHierarchy: SMU ▶ CU ▶ Population with hasMember relationships (use correct OWL 2 transitivity syntax)\nUnits: Store QUDT IRIs as literals in …UnitIRI properties\nDarwin Core: Use as top-level classes for interoperability\nHybrid Approach: SKOS for controlled vocab/enumerations/code lists (including methods); OWL for domain entities; SHACL for validation (not inference)\nOBO Relations Ontology for Relations: Check the Relations Ontology first before defining new relations; use subproperties when extending\n\n\n\n\n\nCan answer a competency question?\nFollows established design patterns?\nAll required annotations present?\nIntegrates with existing hierarchy?\nTested with sample data?\nSchema only (no instance data in ontology file)?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFundamentals\n\n1.1 What is Knowledge Modeling?\n1.2 Ontology vs Knowledge Graph vs Graph Database\n1.3 Why This Ontology?\n1.4 Modeling Approach\n\nGetting Started\n\n2.1 Essential Concepts\n2.2 Schema vs Data Separation\n2.3 Core Conventions\n2.4 Hybrid Modeling Approach\n2.5 Data Validation with SHACL\n2.6 Naming Conventions\n\nDesign Patterns\n\n3.1 Measurement Patterns\n3.2 Hierarchy Patterns\n3.3 Event Patterns\n\nDarwin Core Integration\nQuality Assurance\n\n5.1 Pre-Submission Checklist\n5.2 Validation Steps\n5.3 Common Mistakes\n\nAdvanced Topics\n\n6.1 Competency Questions\n6.2 Troubleshooting\n6.3 External Alignments\n\nResources\n\n7.1 Tools and Workflows\n7.2 Community Process\n7.3 Key Takeaways\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis introductory material has moved to a dedicated onboarding guide for clarity and easier learning.\n\nRead: docs/onboarding.md for Fundamentals (what is modeling, ontology vs knowledge graph, why this ontology, basic approach).\nThis Conventions guide focuses on “how we do things” (operational guidance, patterns, QA, tools, workflows).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are classes? Classes represent categories or types of things in your domain. For example, “Stock”, “SurveyEvent”, and “GeneticSample” are all classes. They’re like the nouns in your vocabulary.\nWhat are properties? Properties describe relationships between things or attributes of things. For example, “aboutStock” describes which stock a measurement is about, and “usesMethod” describes which method was used.\nWhat are instances? Instances are specific examples of classes. For example, “SkeenaSockeye” is an instance of the “Stock” class.\n\n\n\nCritical Rule: Keep the Ontology File Clean\nThe dfo-salmon.ttl file must contain schema elements only - no instance data. This separation is essential for maintainability, versioning, and interoperability.\nWhat Goes in the Ontology File (dfo-salmon.ttl):\n\nOWL Classes: EscapementSurveyEvent, Stock, Measurement\nOWL Properties: usesEnumerationMethod, aboutStock, hasCountValue\nSKOS Concepts: SnorkelSurvey, Type2, VISITS\nAxioms and Rules: Class restrictions, equivalence axioms, SHACL shapes\nMetadata: Labels, definitions, sources, examples\n\nWhat Does NOT Go in the Ontology File:\n\nInstance Data: Specific survey events, stock measurements, count values\nTemporal Data: Data from specific years, seasons, or time periods\nLocation-Specific Data: Data tied to specific rivers, regions, or sites\nRaw Measurements: Actual count values, efficiency rates, coverage percentages\n\nWhere to Store Instance Data:\n\nSeparate RDF files: survey-data-2022.ttl, stock-data-2023.ttl\nGraph databases: Neo4j, Amazon Neptune, Apache Jena TDB\nData management systems: Custom applications with RDF storage\n\nExample of Proper Separation:\n# IN dfo-salmon.ttl (Schema Only)\n:EscapementSurveyEvent a owl:Class ;\n    rdfs:label \"Escapement Survey Event\"@en ;\n    rdfs:comment \"A specific survey event with measured parameters\"@en ;\n    rdfs:subClassOf dwc:Event .\n\n:SnorkelSurvey a skos:Concept ;\n    skos:prefLabel \"Visual Snorkel Count\"@en ;\n    skos:definition \"Two or more trained snorkelers conduct standardized passes\"@en .\n\n# IN survey-data-2022.ttl (Instance Data Only)\n:SkeenaSnorkel2022_001 a :EscapementSurveyEvent ;\n    dfo:usesEnumerationMethod :SnorkelSurvey ;\n    dfo:measuredVisits 6 ;\n    dfo:measuredReachCoverage 0.85 ;\n    dwc:eventDate \"2022-08-15\"^^xsd:date .\nBenefits of This Separation:\n\nStable Schema: Ontology changes independently of data updates\nReusable: Same schema can be used for multiple datasets\nMaintainable: Easier to validate and update schema separately\nInteroperable: Other systems can import just the schema\nVersionable: Schema and data can have different versioning cycles\n\nSHACL Validation:\n\nSchema Validation: SHACL shapes in the ontology file validate data structure\nData Validation: Apply SHACL shapes to instance data files\nQuality Assurance: Ensures data conforms to schema requirements\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequired elements for every class:\n\nType declaration: a owl:Class - This tells the system this is a class\nLabel: rdfs:label \"Human Name\"@en - A human-readable name in English\nDefinition: rdfs:comment \"1–2 sentence definition.\"@en - A clear explanation of what this class represents\nSource attribution: rdfs:isDefinedBy &lt;https://w3id.org/dfo/salmon&gt; - Links back to our ontology\n\nWhy these are required: Labels help humans understand what you mean, definitions prevent confusion about scope, and source attribution ensures proper credit and traceability.\nExample:\n:GeneticSample a owl:Class ;\n    rdfs:label \"Genetic Sample\"@en ;\n    rdfs:comment \"Tissue or material used in genetic stock identification analyses.\"@en ;\n    rdfs:isDefinedBy &lt;https://w3id.org/dfo/salmon&gt; ;\n    dcterms:source \"DFO Molecular Genetics Lab glossary 2024\" ;\n    oboInOwl:hasExactSynonym \"DNA sample\"@en .\n\n\n\nWhat are object properties? Object properties link instances of one class to instances of another class. For example, “aboutStock” links a measurement to a stock.\nRequired elements for every object property:\n\nType declaration: a owl:ObjectProperty\nLabel: rdfs:label \"Human Name\"@en\nDefinition: rdfs:comment \"1–2 sentence definition.\"@en\nSource attribution: rdfs:isDefinedBy &lt;https://w3id.org/dfo/salmon&gt;\n\nOptional but recommended:\n\nDomain: rdfs:domain :ClassName - What type of thing this property describes\nRange: rdfs:range :ClassName - What type of thing this property points to\nSource: dcterms:source \"Reference to where this came from\"\nExample: dcterms:description \"Example usage\"\n\nOBO annotation properties:\n\nDefinition: oboInOwl:hasDefinition - Formal definition\nExact synonym: oboInOwl:hasExactSynonym - Alternative names with same meaning\nRelated synonym: oboInOwl:hasRelatedSynonym - Related but not identical terms\nBroad synonym: oboInOwl:hasBroadSynonym - More general terms\nNarrow synonym: oboInOwl:hasNarrowSynonym - More specific terms\nDatabase cross-reference: oboInOwl:hasDbXref - Links to external databases\n\nExample:\n:aboutStock a owl:ObjectProperty ;\n    rdfs:label \"about stock\"@en ;\n    rdfs:comment \"Links a measurement or observation to the specific stock it describes.\"@en ;\n    rdfs:domain :Measurement ;\n    rdfs:range :Stock ;\n    rdfs:isDefinedBy &lt;https://w3id.org/dfo/salmon&gt; ;\n    dcterms:source \"DFO stock assessment protocols 2024\" .\n\n\n\nWhat are datatype properties? Datatype properties link instances to literal values (text, numbers, dates). For example, “measurementValue” links a measurement to its numeric value.\nRequired elements for every datatype property:\n\nType declaration: a owl:DatatypeProperty\nLabel: rdfs:label \"Human Name\"@en\nDefinition: rdfs:comment \"1–2 sentence definition.\"@en\nSource attribution: rdfs:isDefinedBy &lt;https://w3id.org/dfo/salmon&gt;\n\nOptional but recommended:\n\nDomain: rdfs:domain :ClassName\nRange: rdfs:range xsd:datatype (e.g., xsd:string, xsd:integer, xsd:date)\nSource: dcterms:source \"Reference to where this came from\"\n\nExample:\n:measurementValue a owl:DatatypeProperty ;\n    rdfs:label \"measurement value\"@en ;\n    rdfs:comment \"The numeric value of a measurement.\"@en ;\n    rdfs:domain :Measurement ;\n    rdfs:range xsd:decimal ;\n    rdfs:isDefinedBy &lt;https://w3id.org/dfo/salmon&gt; .\n\n\n\nWhat are SKOS concepts? SKOS concepts are for controlled vocabularies - lists of standardized terms like methods, categories, or codes. Use SKOS when you need a picklist rather than a complex class hierarchy.\nTerminology vs Ontology:\n\nTerminology: A collection of terms with definitions and synonyms (like a dictionary)\nOntology: A formal classification with logical relationships between terms (like a structured knowledge base)\nOur approach: We use OWL for formal relationships and SKOS for simple controlled vocabularies\n\nRequired elements for every SKOS concept:\n\nType declaration: a skos:Concept\nLabel: skos:prefLabel \"Human Name\"@en\nDefinition: skos:definition \"1–2 sentence definition.\"@en\nSource attribution: rdfs:isDefinedBy &lt;https://w3id.org/dfo/salmon&gt;\n\nNote on ROBOT Validation: ROBOT reports missing rdfs:label for SKOS concepts that have skos:prefLabel. This is a ROBOT limitation - per W3C SKOS specification, skos:prefLabel is a subproperty of rdfs:label, so these concepts ARE properly labeled. Do not add redundant rdfs:label properties to satisfy ROBOT.\nExample:\n:SonarCounting a skos:Concept ;\n    skos:prefLabel \"Sonar Counting\"@en ;\n    skos:definition \"Method of counting fish using sonar technology.\"@en ;\n    rdfs:isDefinedBy &lt;https://w3id.org/dfo/salmon&gt; ;\n    skos:broader :CountingMethod .\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo ensure consistent provenance documentation and FAIR compliance, follow these conventions when citing the source of a definition, dataset, or external standard:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProperty\nPurpose\nExpected Value Type\nExample Use\n\n\n\n\ndcterms:source\nPersistent identifier (DOI/Handle/w3id/ARK) for the source resource.\nIRI\n&lt;https://doi.org/10.1234/dfostock.2023&gt;\n\n\ndcterms:bibliographicCitation\nHuman-readable citation text for the source.\nLiteral (string)\n\"DFO (2023).

See ADR-005: External Vocabulary Integration Strategy for the complete rationale and alternatives considered.\nImplementation:\n\n\nMethod: 1. Copy the term IRI (e.g., bfo:0000015) 2. Add minimal metadata: rdfs:label, oboInOwl:hasDefinition (or rdfs:comment) 3. Add rdfs:isDefinedBy pointing to source ontology 4. Use the term as if it were native\nExample - BFO MIREOT:\n# Import specific BFO term via MIREOT\nbfo:0000015 a owl:Class ;\n  rdfs:label \"process\"@en ;\n  oboInOwl:hasDefinition \"An occurrent that has temporal parts.\"@en ;\n  rdfs:isDefinedBy &lt;http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/bfo.owl&gt; .\n\n# Now use it in your ontology\ndfo:StatusAssessment rdfs:subPropertyOf bfo:0000015 .  # process\nDFO Salmon MIREOT Terms: - BFO (3 terms): process, material entity, generically dependent continuant - IAO (4 terms): measurement datum, value specification, information content entity, directive information entity - DQV (5 terms): Dimension, QualityAnnotation, inDimension, Metric, Category\n\n\n\nWe use BFO as our upper ontology to anchor classes in a coherent hierarchy of continuants (e.g., stocks, samples) versus occurrents (events, processes). This improves consistency (no class should represent both a thing and an event) and aligns with OBO Foundry best practices. To keep the ontology lightweight, we MIREOT only a small set of BFO classes (e.g., process, material entity, generically dependent continuant) needed for high-level placement and documentation.\nNote: This short rationale summarizes the why. If expanded with alternatives and trade-offs, consider capturing it as a dedicated ADR.\nDwC positioning: The Darwin Core Conceptual Model is treated as a domain‑specific mid‑level model beneath BFO. We align DwC classes under appropriate BFO categories (e.g., dwc:Event ≈ BFO process; dwc:Organism ≈ BFO material entity; dwc:Assertion/occurrence records ≈ information content entities, when used that way), then subclass our domain classes under DwC terms.\n\n\n\nMethod: 1. Declare prefix: @prefix prov: &lt;http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#&gt; 2. Use terms directly in your ontology 3. No local definitions needed 4. Assumes external ontology is accessible\nExample - PROV-O Prefix Only:\n# Declare prefix (no import, no local definitions)\n@prefix prov: &lt;http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#&gt; .\n\n# Use PROV-O properties directly\n:BarkleyStatus2025 prov:used :EscapementDataset2025 ;\n  prov:wasGeneratedBy :SRBenchmarkMethod ;\n  prov:wasAttributedTo :StockAssessmentTeam .\nDFO Salmon Prefix-Only: - PROV-O (~6 properties): wasGeneratedBy, wasDerivedFrom, used, wasAttributedTo, etc. - RO (alignment via rdfs:seeAlso): has_member, member_of - SKOS (extensive): Concept, ConceptScheme, prefLabel, definition, etc. - DwC (extensive): Event, Organism, Assertion, MaterialSample, etc.\n\n\n\n\nBFO (upper ontology): Retain as the top‑level; MIREOT only core classes (process, material entity, site) and assert domain classes under them for clarity.\nIAO (information artifacts): Use for documents and information entities (e.g., FSAR, advice text). MIREOT only needed terms; model dfo:ScientificOutput ⊑ iao:0000030 (information content entity).\nDarwin Core (domain scaffolding): Subclass DFO domain classes under DwC (e.g., dfo:SurveyEvent ⊑ dwc:Event, dfo:StatusAssessment ⊑ dwc:Assertion). Treat DwC as mid‑level beneath BFO.\nSchema.org and DCAT (web/catalog): Keep dfo:Dataset ⊑ schema:Dataset; optionally align dfo:Dataset ⊑ dcat:Dataset for catalog compatibility; use DCAT properties (e.g., distributions) when publishing catalogs.\nPROV‑O (provenance): Prefix‑only; use relations (prov:used, prov:wasGeneratedBy, prov:wasDerivedFrom) without importing full classes.\nDQV (quality): Use dqv:QualityAnnotation and dqv:inDimension for evidence/quality badges; MIREOT minimal core.\nDPROD (data products): Evaluate post‑MVP; likely align dfo:Dataset ⊑ dprod:Dataset and describe services/distributions via DPROD.\nRO (relations): Prefer RO for fundamental relations; align custom properties as subproperties of RO (see 6.6).\nOBI (protocols/assays): Import specific terms only when clearly beneficial; avoid heavy imports.\nENVO (environment): Use selectively for habitat/environment terms as annotations or links.\nORG (organizations): Prefix‑only; use org:Organization/units for decision‑maker modeling.\n\n\n\n\nWhen to use MIREOT: - Need 3-20 specific terms with labels/definitions - Want documentation in your ontology - Don’t need reasoning over the full imported ontology\nWhen to use prefix-only: - Using properties only (not classes) - Terms are universally known (SKOS, Dublin Core) - Pure data typing (xsd:) - Lightweight alignment without local definitions\nWhen NOT to use full imports: - Avoid importing entire external ontologies (100s-1000s of terms) - Causes slow loading and reasoning - Potential conflicts with other imports\n\n\n\n\nWe use PROV-O for provenance and DQV for quality annotations that back UI badges and evidence checks.\nExample (illustrative Turtle):\n:Assessment_X a dfo:StatusAssessment ;\n  prov:used :Dataset_Y ;\n  prov:wasGeneratedBy :AnalysisMethod_Z ;\n  prov:wasDerivedFrom :ReferencePoint_Q .\n\n:ReferencePoint_Q a dfo:ReferencePoint ;\n  dfo:refPointType :LRP .\n\n:Assessment_X_EvidenceComplete a dfo:CompleteEvidence ;\n  dqv:inDimension dfo:EvidenceCompletenessDimension .\n\n:Assessment_X dqv:hasQualityAnnotation :Assessment_X_EvidenceComplete .\nHow to apply:\n\nBefore finalizing an assessment, attach a quality annotation indicating evidence state: dfo:CompleteEvidence, dfo:GapsEvidence, or dfo:MissingCriticalEvidence, linked by dqv:hasQualityAnnotation and categorized via dqv:inDimension.\nUse prov:used, prov:wasGeneratedBy, and prov:wasDerivedFrom to record datasets, methods, and reference points underpinning the assessment.\n\nUncertainty properties:\n\nFor GSI composition measurements, record sample size via dfo:gsi_sample_size and 95% CI via dfo:gsi_ci (per GRD integration schema). Shapes in 2.5 can require these when applicable and flag omissions.\n\n\n\n\nUse this decision guide to choose the right modeling primitive:\n\nSKOS Concept\n\nUse for controlled vocabulary/code-list values that don’t need logical axioms or subclass hierarchies.\nExamples: spawner_origin values (:Wild, :Hatchery), data_source_type, reference_point_type, decision_type, status zone values (:RedZone, :AmberZone, :GreenZone), enumeration methods (:SnorkelSurvey, :SonarCounting), and estimate methods (:AreaUnderCurve, :FixedStationTally).\nPattern: Use an object property whose range is skos:Concept (e.g., dfo:statusZone → skos:Concept, dfo:usesEnumerationMethod → skos:Concept).\n\nOWL Class\n\nUse for fundamental domain entities or when hierarchy/specialization is needed.\nExamples: dfo:ConservationUnit, dfo:Stock, dfo:StatusAssessment, dfo:EscapementMethod (methodological families for classification purposes).\nNote: Enumeration and estimate methods (specific methods like Snorkel Survey, Area Under Curve) are modeled as SKOS concepts per ADR-001. The dfo:EscapementMethod OWL class hierarchy represents methodological families for broader classification, distinct from the SKOS enumeration/estimate method vocabularies.\n\nOWL Individual\n\nUse for concrete, real-world instances (lives in data graphs, not the ontology schema file).\nExamples: A specific CU instance (e.g., :NanaimoRiverChinookCU_2024), a policy document (e.g., :WildSalmonPolicy_2005), or a specific survey event instance (e.g., :SkeenaSnorkel2022_001 a :EscapementSurveyEvent).\nNote: Enumeration and estimate methods are SKOS concepts, not individuals. Use the SKOS concepts directly (e.g., :SnorkelSurvey, :AreaUnderCurve) in data instances rather than creating method instances.\nNaming recommendation: PascalCase with disambiguators as needed (:SkeenaSnorkel2022_001, :SkeenaSockeye), or a short path-like fragment (#Stock/SkeenaSockeye). Avoid spaces; prefer stable, meaningful identifiers.\n\n\nDo not duplicate the same concept as both an OWL class and a SKOS concept (or an individual) unless there is a deliberate bridge/mapping with documented rationale. Choose one approach based on the above rules to avoid ambiguity.\n\n\n\nDecision: We use a hybrid approach combining OWL and SKOS for classification. Automated approaches are deferred; see ADR-001: Hybrid OWL+SKOS Modeling Approach for the complete rationale and alternatives considered.\nImplementation:\nFour-Layer Architecture:\n\nMethods as SKOS Concepts - Enumeration and estimation methods are SKOS concepts in controlled vocabularies (e.g., :SnorkelSurvey, :SonarCounting, :AreaUnderCurve, :FixedStationTally).\nEvents as OWL Classes - Survey/estimate events that extend Darwin Core Event\nMetadata on Events - Rich data about how methods were applied in specific surveys\nDowngrade Criteria as SKOS - Standardized criteria for type assignment (manual now; automation later)\n\nComplete Example:\n# Layer 1: SKOS Methods (Controlled Vocabularies)\n:SnorkelSurvey a skos:Concept ;\n    skos:prefLabel \"Visual Snorkel Count\"@en ;\n    skos:definition \"Two or more trained snorkelers conduct standardized passes within defined segments\"@en ;\n    skos:inScheme :EnumerationMethodScheme ;\n    skos:broader :EnumerationMethod .\n\n:AreaUnderCurve a skos:Concept ;\n    skos:prefLabel \"Area Under the Curve (AUC)\"@en ;\n    skos:definition \"Integrates serial counts over time using a survey-life parameter\"@en ;\n    skos:inScheme :EstimateMethodScheme ;\n    skos:broader :EstimateMethod .\n\n# Layer 2: SKOS Downgrade Criteria\n:VISITS a skos:Concept ;\n    skos:prefLabel \"Number of visits\"@en ;\n    skos:definition \"Too few site visits for the claimed precision tier\"@en ;\n    skos:inScheme :DowngradeCriteriaScheme .\n\n:REACH_COVERAGE a skos:Concept ;\n    skos:prefLabel \"Spatial coverage\"@en ;\n    skos:definition \"Fraction of intended reaches/segments not surveyed\"@en ;\n    skos:inScheme :DowngradeCriteriaScheme .\n\n# Layer 3: OWL Event Classes\n:EscapementSurveyEvent a owl:Class ;\n    rdfs:label \"Escapement Survey Event\"@en ;\n    rdfs:comment \"A specific survey event with measured parameters\"@en ;\n    rdfs:subClassOf dwc:Event ;\n    rdfs:isDefinedBy &lt;https://w3id.org/dfo/salmon&gt; .\n\n# Layer 4: Event Instance with Metadata\n:SkeenaSnorkel2022_001 a :EscapementSurveyEvent ;\n    rdfs:label \"Skeena Snorkel Survey 2022-001\"@en ;\n    dfo:usesEnumerationMethod :SnorkelSurvey ;\n    dfo:usesEstimateMethod :AreaUnderCurve ;\n    dfo:measuredVisits 6 ;\n    dfo:measuredReachCoverage 0.85 ;\n    dfo:measuredVisibility :Good ;\n    dfo:measuredObserverEfficiency 0.8 ;\n    dfo:percentRiverSwam 0.75 ;\n    dfo:hasDocumentation :SIL_2022_001 ;\n    dfo:hasQAReport :QA_2022_001 ;\n    dfo:downgradeCriteriaMet :VISIBILITY, :REACH_COVERAGE ;\n    dwc:eventDate \"2022-08-15\"^^xsd:date ;\n    dwc:samplingProtocol :DFOSnorkelProtocol ;\n    rdfs:isDefinedBy &lt;https://w3id.org/dfo/salmon&gt; .\nKey Principles:\n\nMethods are vocabulary terms - Use SKOS for enumeration methods, estimate methods, and downgrade criteria\nEvents carry the data - OWL classes for survey events with rich metadata properties\nMetadata on instances - Observer efficiency, coverage, visibility are properties of specific surveys\nClassification (current) - Estimate types are manually assigned based on criteria; SHACL flags inconsistencies. Automated classification is deferred (see 2.5).\n\n\n\n\nSKOS concepts are used strictly for controlled lists (e.g., categories, downgrade criteria, status zones) and must not be treated as OWL classes in axioms.\nDo not assert or infer SKOS concepts as owl:Class or use them as class expressions in restrictions.\n\nWhat not to do (anti-pattern):\n# ❌ Do NOT model a SKOS concept as an OWL class\n:RedZone a owl:Class .\n\n# ❌ Do NOT use a SKOS concept as if it were an OWL class in restrictions\n:EscapementSurveyEvent rdfs:subClassOf [\n  a owl:Restriction ;\n  owl:onProperty dfo:usesEnumerationMethod ;\n  owl:allValuesFrom :RedZone  # :RedZone should be a skos:Concept, not a class\n] .\nCorrect usage (pattern):\n# ✅ Keep :RedZone as a SKOS concept in a concept scheme\n:RedZone a skos:Concept ;\n  skos:prefLabel \"Red Zone\"@en ;\n  skos:inScheme :StatusZoneScheme .\n\n# ✅ Constrain with SHACL or document as guidance; keep OWL domain/range on properties\n:statusZone a owl:ObjectProperty ;\n  rdfs:domain :StatusAssessment ;\n  rdfs:range skos:Concept .\nWhy: Per SKOS and OWL best practices (W3C SKOS Reference) and community guidance (e.g., Steven Baskauf), mixing SKOS individuals as OWL classes leads to punning and can break OWL DL reasoning assumptions. Keep SKOS for terminology, OWL for logical class hierarchies.\n\n\n\n\nWhy SHACL? SHACL (Shapes Constraint Language) provides validation rules that can enforce data quality and ensure required fields are present. It separates data validation from classification logic. In our stack, shapes are used for validation only, not for inference or automated classification.\nNote: Estimate types are manually assigned based on Hyatt 1997 criteria. Automated classification is deferred to post-MVP.\nSHACL Shape for Method Validation:\n# SHACL Shape for Snorkel Survey Events\n:SnorkelSurveyShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetClass :EscapementSurveyEvent ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path dfo:usesEnumerationMethod ;\n        sh:hasValue :SnorkelSurvey ;\n        sh:message \"Survey must use snorkel enumeration method\"\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path dfo:measuredVisits ;\n        sh:datatype xsd:integer ;\n        sh:minInclusive 1 ;\n        sh:message \"Number of visits must be a positive integer\"\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path dfo:measuredReachCoverage ;\n        sh:datatype xsd:decimal ;\n        sh:minInclusive 0.0 ;\n        sh:maxInclusive 1.0 ;\n        sh:message \"Reach coverage must be between 0.0 and 1.0\"\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path dfo:measuredVisibility ;\n        sh:in ( :Excellent :Good :Fair :Poor ) ;\n        sh:message \"Visibility must be one of: Excellent, Good, Fair, Poor\"\n    ] .\nImplementation Pipeline:\n\nData Entry - Users create survey events with metadata\nSHACL Validation - Ensures required fields are present and valid\nManual Classification - Estimate types assigned based on Hyatt 1997 criteria\nQuality Assessment - Review data completeness and quality\n\n\n\n\nClasses: Use PascalCase (e.g., EscapementMeasurement, GeneticSample) Properties: Use lowerCamelCase (e.g., aboutStock, usesMethod, hasMember) SKOS Concepts: Use PascalCase (e.g., SonarCounting, MicrosatelliteAssay) Instances: Use PascalCase with descriptive names (e.g., SkeenaSockeye, FraserCoho)\nWhy consistent naming matters: It makes the ontology easier to read, understand, and maintain. It also helps prevent confusion when multiple people are contributing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBasic Measurement Pattern: Every measurement must have:\n\ndwc:measurementType - What was measured\ndwc:measurementValue - The measured value\ndwc:measurementUnit - The unit of measurement\ndfo:aboutStock - Which stock it describes\ndfo:observedDuring - Which event it was collected during\ndfo:usesMethod - Which method was used\n\nExample:\n:EscapementCount2022 a dfo:EscapementMeasurement ;\n    dwc:measurementType \"abundance\" ;\n    dwc:measurementValue \"1250\"^^xsd:integer ;\n    dwc:measurementUnit \"http://qudt.org/vocab/unit/Each\" ;\n    dfo:aboutStock :SkeenaSockeye ;\n    dfo:observedDuring :SkeenaSurvey2022 ;\n    dfo:usesMethod :SonarCounting .\n\n\n\nManagement Hierarchy Pattern:\n\nManagement Units contain Conservation Units\nConservation Units contain Stocks\nUse transitive dfo:hasMember relationships\nCreate type-specific subproperties for clarity\n\nExample:\n:BCInteriorMU a dfo:ManagementUnit ;\n    dfo:hasMemberCU :FraserCUCoho .\n\n:FraserCUCoho a dfo:ConservationUnit ;\n    dfo:hasMemberStock :FraserCohoStock .\n\n# Transitive inference: BCInteriorMU hasMember FraserCohoStock\n\n\n\nSurvey Event Pattern:\n\nSurveys contain multiple measurement events\nEach measurement event has specific protocols\nEvents can be nested (project &gt; survey &gt; measurement)\n\nExample:\n:SalmonSurvey2023 a eco:Survey ;\n    dwc:eventDate \"2023-05-01/2023-09-30\"^^xsd:gYear ;\n    dwc:samplingProtocol :DFOEscapementProtocol .\n\n:DailyCount2023_06_15 a dfo:EscapementSurveyEvent ;\n    dwc:parentEventID :SalmonSurvey2023 ;\n    dwc:eventDate \"2023-06-15\"^^xsd:date ;\n    dwc:samplingProtocol :SonarCountingProtocol .\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy integrate with Darwin Core? Darwin Core provides a widely-adopted standard for biodiversity data that enables interoperability with GBIF, OBIS, and other international biodiversity platforms. By aligning with Darwin Core, your salmon data becomes discoverable and usable by the broader scientific community.\n\n📋 Complete Darwin Core Integration: See the DFO Salmon Ontology: Product Requirements Document for the complete technical approach, including hybrid modeling strategy, core patterns, and Darwin Core integration details.\n\nKey Darwin Core Classes to Use:\n\ndwc:Event - Actions, processes, or circumstances occurring at a place and time\ndwc:Occurrence - A state of an organism in an event\ndwc:Organism - A particular organism or defined group of organisms\ndwc:MaterialSample - Physical samples that can be identified and managed\ndwc:Identification - Taxonomic determinations of organisms\n[DwC-CM] dwc:Assertion (under review) - A generalized assertion (e.g., measurement/occurrence) with provenance\ndwc:Agent - People, groups, organizations, machines, or software that can act\ndwc:Media - Digital media (images, videos, sounds, text)\ndwc:Protocol - Methods used during actions\n\nDFO Extensions:\n# DFO-specific classes that extend Darwin Core\ndfo:ManagementUnit rdfs:subClassOf dwc:Event ;\n    rdfs:label \"Management Unit\"@en ;\n    rdfs:comment \"A geographic or administrative unit for salmon management\"@en .\n\ndfo:ConservationUnit rdfs:subClassOf dwc:Event ;\n    rdfs:label \"Conservation Unit\"@en ;\n    rdfs:comment \"A biologically meaningful unit for conservation planning\"@en .\n\ndfo:Stock rdfs:subClassOf dwc:Organism ;\n    rdfs:label \"Stock\"@en ;\n    rdfs:comment \"A population of salmon with distinct characteristics\"@en .\n\n\nWe align to the Darwin Core Conceptual Model (DwC-CM, under review) as our domain frame for biodiversity data. DwC-CM is treated as a mid-level model beneath our upper ontology (BFO):\n\nOperational entities are dwc:Event-based (surveys, analyses, runs) to preserve time/place semantics; we align these to BFO processes.\nDeterminations and derived statements use dwc:Assertion where supported. We do not model or export legacy dwc:MeasurementOrFact.\nOrganismal and occurrence context is explicit via dwc:Organism and dwc:Occurrence when needed by integration partners.\n\nDFO specializations (illustrative):\n\ndfo:EscapementSurveyEvent rdfs:subClassOf dwc:Event\ndfo:GSIRun rdfs:subClassOf dwc:Event\ndfo:Stock rdfs:subClassOf dwc:Organism\ndfo:StatusAssessment rdfs:subClassOf dwc:Assertion (DwC-CM)\n\nEarly adopter note: We consciously apply DwC terms per the conceptual model under review, making this ontology among early adopters of DwC’s semantic layer. Where terms or ranges are still stabilizing, we document assumptions and keep changes localized via an anti‑corruption layer.\n\n\n\nFor teams familiar with DwC tabular packages, here is a minimal mapping to DFO classes/properties:\n\nEvent core (event.txt)\n\neventID → IRI of dfo:EscapementSurveyEvent or dfo:GSIRun\neventDate, parentEventID, locationID → time/place nesting for events\nsamplingProtocol → dfo:usesEnumerationMethod or dfo:usedAssay (DFO properties)\n\nExtension: Occurrence (occurrence.txt) when organismal presence is explicit\n\noccurrenceID → occurrence instance IRI\norganismID → dfo:Stock (linked via dfo:aboutStock in graph exports)\n\nExtension: Assertions (assertion.txt; DwC-CM)\n\nassertionID → IRI of dfo:StatusAssessment (as dwc:Assertion)\nsubjectID → assessed entity (CU/SMU)\npredicate/object → status/benchmark outcomes (or typed properties in RDF)\nProvenance → see PROV usage in Section 2.3.7\n\n\nThis outline aims to let DwC users quickly map DFO semantics onto familiar DwC package structures while preserving richer semantics in RDF/JSON-LD.\n\n\n\nContext: The Darwin Core Conceptual Model (DwC-CM) provides a semantic layer for Darwin Core that addresses long-standing ambiguities and provides clearer class definitions and relationships. DFO Salmon Ontology implements DwC-CM patterns for improved interoperability and semantic clarity.\n\n\nOccurrence Usage: - Definition: dwc:Occurrence is explicitly defined as “a state of an Organism in an Event” - DFO Usage: Use dwc:Occurrence when modeling individual fish observations (e.g., genetic sampling data where each fish sampled is an Occurrence of that fish at the sampling event) - Aggregate Data: For aggregate data (escapement counts, surveys), use dwc:Event and dwc:Assertion patterns - Avoid: Conflating Occurrence with Event or with Organism\nAssertion Class Implementation: - Purpose: dwc:Assertion replaces dwc:MeasurementOrFact with clearer semantics - DFO Implementation: dfo:EscapementMeasurement ⊑ dwc:Assertion and dfo:GSICompositionMeasurement ⊑ dwc:Assertion - Benefits: Better semantic clarity, improved interoperability, alignment with modern DwC practices\nStructured Relationships: - Property Domains/Ranges: DwC-CM defines which properties apply to which classes with clear domain/range expectations - DFO Alignment: DFO property usage aligns with DwC-CM constraints (e.g., dwc:eventDate on events, dwc:measurementValue on assertions)\n\n\n\nFor Measurements: - Use dwc:Assertion as superclass for all measurement classes - Ensure dwc:measurementType, dwc:measurementValue, dwc:measurementUnit are used appropriately - Document the assertion pattern for measurements\nFor Events: - Use dwc:Event as superclass for survey events - Use dwc:parentEventID for event hierarchies when appropriate - Ensure dwc:eventDate is used on event classes\nFor Organisms: - Use dwc:Organism for stock classes - Use dwc:Occurrence for individual organism observations (when applicable) - Use dwc:MaterialEntity for physical samples\nFor Data Packages: - Structure exports to align with DwC-CM classes - Include proper metadata for dataset descriptions - Ensure reference links exist between related entities\n\n\n\n\n\nPrefer existing DwC classes when semantics match before creating a new class. Example: use dwc:MaterialEntity for tangible sample artifacts rather than introducing a parallel dfo:Sample.\nWe typically subclass domain-specific classes under DwC terms (e.g., dfo:EscapementSurveyEvent ⊑ dwc:Event). We rarely use dwc:Assertion directly in schema; assertions arise by inference from specialized subclasses and are represented in data exports.\nPresence/absence and similar observation concepts may use dwc:Occurrence if/when these data are integrated. Coordinate with ontology leads before modeling new observational patterns.\nWhen a needed concept appears to overlap with DwC, open a discussion/issue or an ADR proposal to document rationale and trade-offs.\nDwC-CM Alignment: Ensure new terms align with DwC-CM patterns and use dwc:Assertion for measurement classes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore submitting new terms:\n\nCan you answer relevant competency questions with this term?\nDoes the term follow established design patterns?\nAre all required annotations present (label, definition, source)?\nDoes the term integrate properly with existing hierarchy?\nHave you tested the term with sample data?\nIs the term name consistent with naming conventions?\nAre all relationships properly typed (domain/range)?\nDoes the term avoid duplicating existing functionality?\n\n\n\n\nLogical Consistency:\n\nRun reasoner to check for unsatisfiable classes\nVerify no classes appear under owl:Nothing\nCheck for circular dependencies in hierarchies\nValidate domain/range restrictions are appropriate\n\nContent Quality:\n\nDefinitions are clear and unambiguous\nLabels follow naming conventions\nSynonyms are appropriate and well-sourced\nExamples are relevant and helpful\n\nIntegration Quality:\n\nTerm integrates with existing classes\nRelationships are properly defined\nExternal references are valid and accessible\nCompetency questions can be answered\n\nOBO Foundry Quality Standards:\n\nOpen: Freely available under CC-BY or CC0 license\nInteroperable: Uses standard OBO relations and formats\nLogically well-formed: No logical inconsistencies\nScientifically accurate: Definitions reflect current scientific knowledge\nNon-overlapping scope: Clear boundaries with other ontologies\nCommon syntax: Uses OBO format and standard annotation properties\nOWL 2 compliant: Uses correct OWL 2 syntax (e.g., owl:TransitiveProperty as type, not boolean)\nRO relation reuse: Checks RO for existing relations before defining new ones\n\n\n\n\nNaming Issues:\n\nInconsistent naming conventions (e.g., mixing camelCase and snake_case)\nUsing abbreviations without explanation\nCreating terms that are too specific or too general\n\nRelationship Issues:\n\nMissing essential relationships\nOver-constraining with unnecessary restrictions\nCreating circular or contradictory relationships\n\nContent Issues:\n\nVague or unclear definitions\nMissing required annotations\nDuplicating existing terms with different names\n\nOWL 2 Syntax Issues:\n\nUsing owl:TransitiveProperty true instead of a owl:TransitiveProperty\nIncorrect transitivity declarations that violate OWL 2 specification\nMissing RO relation checks before defining new relations\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are competency questions? These are the specific questions your ontology should be able to answer. They guide design decisions and validate that the ontology serves its intended purpose. Competency questions are essential for ensuring your ontology can actually support the research and data integration needs of the salmon science community.\nWhy competency questions matter:\n\nDesign guidance: Help determine what terms and relationships are needed\nValidation mechanism: Ensure the ontology can answer the questions it’s designed to address\nTesting framework: Enable systematic validation of the ontology’s utility\nCommunity alignment: Ensure all stakeholders understand the ontology’s purpose\n\n\n📋 Complete Competency Questions: See the DFO Salmon Ontology: Competency Questions for the complete, authoritative list of competency questions organized by domain (Stock Assessment, Genetics/GSI, Management & Policy, and Cross-Domain Integration).\n\n\n\nDuring Design:\n\nWrite competency questions before creating new terms\nUse them to identify missing relationships or classes\nEnsure each new term contributes to answering at least one question\n\nDuring Validation:\n\nConvert competency questions to SPARQL queries when possible\nTest queries with sample data to ensure they return meaningful results\nUse them to validate that the ontology serves its intended purpose\n\nExample SPARQL Query:\n# Find all escapement methods used for Sockeye stocks in 2022\nPREFIX dfo: &lt;https://w3id.org/dfo/salmon#&gt;\nPREFIX dwc: &lt;http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/&gt;\n\nSELECT ?method ?stock ?event WHERE {\n  ?measurement dfo:aboutStock ?stock ;\n               dfo:usesMethod ?method ;\n               dfo:observedDuring ?event .\n  ?event dwc:eventDate \"2022\"^^xsd:gYear .\n  ?stock rdfs:label ?stockLabel .\n  FILTER(CONTAINS(?stockLabel, \"Sockeye\"))\n}\n\n\n\n\nWhy troubleshooting matters: Ontology development involves complex logical relationships that can lead to unexpected errors. Understanding common issues and their solutions helps you develop more effectively and avoid common pitfalls.\n\n\nProblem: Term appears under owl:Nothing\n\nCause: Logical inconsistency (e.g., conflicting restrictions, disjoint classes)\nSolution:\n\nClick the ? button next to owl:Nothing to see explanation\nCheck for disjoint class assertions that conflict\nLook for contradictory domain/range restrictions\nRemove or modify conflicting axioms\n\n\nProblem: Missing inferred relationships\n\nCause: Reasoner not run or missing logical axioms\nSolution:\n\nRun the reasoner (ELK or HermiT)\nAdd necessary equivalence axioms\nCheck that subclass relationships are properly defined\n\n\nProblem: Unexpected classification results\n\nCause: Incorrect logical definitions or missing restrictions\nSolution:\n\nReview equivalence axioms carefully\nCheck that restrictions use correct quantifiers (some vs. only)\nVerify that property chains are properly defined\n\n\n\n\n\nProblem: Can’t find existing term\n\nCause: Search in wrong ontology or using wrong label\nSolution:\n\nUse broader search terms\nCheck synonyms and alternative names\nSearch in the correct ontology namespace\nUse partial string matching\n\n\nProblem: Term doesn’t integrate with existing hierarchy\n\nCause: Missing subclass relationships or incorrect placement\nSolution:\n\nIdentify the correct parent class\nAdd appropriate subclass relationships\nCheck that the term fits the intended hierarchy\nConsider if the term should be a different type (class vs. property)\n\n\nProblem: Relationships don’t work as expected\n\nCause: Incorrect domain/range restrictions or missing properties\nSolution:\n\nCheck that domain/range restrictions are appropriate\nVerify that properties are properly typed\nEnsure that relationships are defined in the correct direction\nTest with sample data\n\n\n\n\n\nProblem: Ontology won’t load in Protégé\n\nCause: Syntax errors, missing imports, or file corruption\nSolution:\n\nCheck for syntax errors in Turtle/RDF\nVerify that all imports are accessible\nTry loading a smaller subset of the ontology\nCheck file encoding and line endings\n\n\nProblem: Reasoner runs very slowly\n\nCause: Complex logical definitions or large ontology\nSolution:\n\nUse a faster reasoner (ELK instead of HermiT)\nSimplify complex logical definitions\nConsider modularizing the ontology\nRemove unnecessary axioms\n\n\nProblem: SPARQL queries return no results\n\nCause: Incorrect query syntax or missing data\nSolution:\n\nCheck query syntax carefully\nVerify that data exists for the query\nTest with simpler queries first\nCheck that namespaces are properly declared\n\n\n\n\n\nProblem: JFact datatype warning for EstimateType\n\nWarning: ERROR uk.ac.manchester.cs.jfact.datatypes.DatatypeFactory - A known datatype for https://w3id.org/dfo/salmon#EstimateType cannot be found; literal will be replaced with rdfs:Literal\nRoot Cause: EstimateType is correctly modeled as skos:Concept (not a datatype). JFact’s datatype checking system is confused by SKOS concept usage as object property ranges.\nImpact: None - all reasoners (ELK, HermiT, JFact) produce identical results (2183 lines). Ontology is logically consistent.\nAction: This warning can be safely ignored.\n\n\n\n\nWhen to ask for help:\n\nYou’ve tried the troubleshooting steps but the problem persists\nThe issue affects multiple terms or relationships\nYou’re unsure about the correct modeling approach\nThe problem seems to be a bug in the tools\n\nHow to ask for help:\n\nProvide a clear description of the problem\nInclude relevant code snippets or error messages\nExplain what you’ve already tried\nSpecify which tools and versions you’re using\n\nWhere to get help:\n\nGitHub Issues for the DFO Salmon Ontology\nOBO Foundry community forums\nProtégé user mailing lists\nOntology development workshops and training\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is subclassing? Subclassing represents “is-a” relationships. For example, “Sockeye” is a subclass of “Salmon” because every sockeye is a salmon.\nWhen to use subclassing:\n\nWhen one class is a more specific type of another\nWhen all instances of the subclass are also instances of the superclass\nWhen you want to inherit properties from the parent class\n\nExample:\n:Sockeye rdfs:subClassOf :Salmon ;\n    rdfs:label \"Sockeye\"@en ;\n    rdfs:comment \"A species of salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka)\"@en .\n\n\n\nWhat is equivalence? Equivalence states that two classes are identical in meaning. Use this when two terms represent exactly the same concept.\nWhen to use equivalence:\n\nWhen two classes have identical meaning but different names\nWhen aligning with external vocabularies\nWhen consolidating duplicate concepts\n\nExample:\n:DFODataset rdfs:subClassOf :InformationEntity ;\n    owl:equivalentClass schema:Dataset ;\n    rdfs:label \"Dataset\"@en .\n\n\n\nWhat is disjointness? Disjointness states that two classes cannot have common instances. Use this when classes are mutually exclusive.\nWhen to use disjointness:\n\nWhen classes represent mutually exclusive categories\nWhen you want to prevent logical inconsistencies\nWhen modeling taxonomic hierarchies\n\nExample:\n:Freshwater rdfs:subClassOf :Environment ;\n    owl:disjointWith :Marine .\n\n:Marine rdfs:subClassOf :Environment ;\n    owl:disjointWith :Freshwater .\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the membership pattern? This pattern represents the hierarchical relationship between Management Units, Conservation Units, and Stocks in salmon management.\nThe Pattern:\n\nManagement Units contain Conservation Units\nConservation Units contain Stocks\nUse transitive hasMember relationships\nCreate type-specific subproperties for clarity\n\nImplementation:\n# Define the base membership property\n:hasMember a owl:ObjectProperty, owl:TransitiveProperty ;\n    rdfs:label \"has member\"@en ;\n    rdfs:comment \"A transitive relationship indicating membership in a group\"@en .\n\n# Define type-specific subproperties\n:hasMemberCU rdfs:subPropertyOf :hasMember ;\n    rdfs:label \"has member conservation unit\"@en ;\n    rdfs:domain :ManagementUnit ;\n    rdfs:range :ConservationUnit .\n\n:hasMemberStock rdfs:subPropertyOf :hasMember ;\n    rdfs:label \"has member stock\"@en ;\n    rdfs:domain :ConservationUnit ;\n    rdfs:range :Stock .\n\n# Example usage\n:BCInteriorMU a :ManagementUnit ;\n    :hasMemberCU :FraserCUCoho .\n\n:FraserCUCoho a :ConservationUnit ;\n    :hasMemberStock :FraserCohoStock .\n\n# Transitive inference: BCInteriorMU hasMember FraserCohoStock\n\n\n\n\n\nRequired elements for every escapement measurement:\n\ndwc:measurementType - What was measured (e.g., “abundance”)\ndwc:measurementValue - The measured value\ndwc:measurementUnit - The unit of measurement (QUDT IRI)\ndfo:aboutStock - Which stock it describes\ndfo:observedDuring - Which event it was collected during\ndfo:usesMethod - Which method was used\n\nExample:\n:EscapementCount2022 a :EscapementMeasurement ;\n    dwc:measurementType \"abundance\" ;\n    dwc:measurementValue \"1250\"^^xsd:integer ;\n    dwc:measurementUnit \"http://qudt.org/vocab/unit/Each\" ;\n    dfo:aboutStock :SkeenaSockeye ;\n    dfo:observedDuring :SkeenaSurvey2022 ;\n    dfo:usesMethod :SonarCounting .\n\n\n\nRequired elements for every GSI measurement:\n\ndfo:aboutReportingUnit - Which genetic reporting unit\ndfo:proportion - The proportion of the sample\ndfo:confidence - Confidence interval or quality measure\ndfo:analyzedIn - Which GSI run produced this result\ndfo:basedOnSamples - Which samples were analyzed\n\nExample:\n:GSIResult2023_001 a :GSICompositionMeasurement ;\n    dfo:aboutReportingUnit :FraserSockeyeRU ;\n    dfo:proportion \"0.85\"^^xsd:decimal ;\n    dfo:confidence \"0.02\"^^xsd:decimal ;\n    dfo:analyzedIn :GSIRun2023_001 ;\n    dfo:basedOnSamples :SampleSet2023_001 .\n\n\n\n\nWhy external alignments matter: They ensure your ontology can work with other systems and datasets, making your data more discoverable and useful.\nKey external vocabularies:\n\nQUDT: Units of measurement (http://qudt.org/vocab/unit/)\nENVO: Environmental terms (http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_)\nGBIF Backbone: Taxonomic names (http://www.gbif.org/species/)\nDarwin Core: Biodiversity data standards (http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/)\nRO (Relations Ontology): Standard relations (http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_)\nAGROVOC: Agricultural/fisheries thesaurus for common concepts (https://agrovoc.fao.org/)\nSchema.org/DCAT: Web and catalog vocabularies for datasets and distributions\nIAO: Information artifact ontology for documents and datasets\nORG: Organizational structure and units (https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-org/)\n\nOBO Foundry Relation Reuse Requirements:\n\nCheck RO first: Before defining new relations, check if equivalent relations exist in RO\nUse RO IRIs: When equivalent relations exist, use the RO IRI directly or create subproperties\nAvoid label conflicts: OBO Foundry review flags non-RO relations with RO-equivalent labels\nSubproperty alignment: Create subproperties of RO relations when domain-specific extensions are needed\n\nExample RO Alignment:\n# Instead of defining a new \"hasMember\" property, align with RO\n:hasMember rdfs:subPropertyOf ro:has_part ;\n    rdfs:label \"has member\"@en ;\n    rdfs:comment \"A transitive relationship indicating membership in a group\"@en .\n\n# Or use RO directly when appropriate\n:populationOf ro:part_of :stock ;\n    rdfs:label \"population of\"@en .\nImplementation:\n\nStore external IRIs as literals in …UnitIRI properties\nUse dcterms:source to reference external vocabularies\nPlan to convert to object properties in future versions\nCheck RO for existing relations before defining new ones\n\nPractical guidance for new relationships:\n\nBefore minting a custom property like partOfRiver, prefer the generic RO property ro:part_of and model “river” via the class hierarchy (e.g., dfo:RiverSegment).\nWhen a domain-specific refinement is needed, define a custom subproperty aligned to RO (e.g., dfo:hasMemberCU rdfs:subPropertyOf ro:has_part). This keeps reasoning consistent and improves interoperability.\n\nUnit Property Enhancement (Non-breaking): For richer unit semantics, consider adding object properties alongside datatype properties:\n# Current approach: Store QUDT IRIs as literals\n:measurementUnitIRI a owl:DatatypeProperty ;\n    rdfs:label \"measurement unit IRI\"@en ;\n    rdfs:comment \"IRI of the unit used in a measurement\"@en ;\n    rdfs:domain :Measurement ;\n    rdfs:range xsd:anyURI .\n\n# Enhanced approach: Add object property for reasoning\n:hasUnit a owl:ObjectProperty ;\n    rdfs:label \"has unit\"@en ;\n    rdfs:comment \"Links a measurement to a unit (e.g., QUDT Unit)\"@en ;\n    rdfs:domain :Measurement ;\n    rdfs:range qudt:Unit ;\n    rdfs:isDefinedBy &lt;https://w3id.org/dfo/salmon&gt; .\n\n# Example usage with both approaches\n:EscapementCount2022 a :EscapementMeasurement ;\n    :measurementUnitIRI \"http://qudt.org/vocab/unit/Each\"^^xsd:anyURI ;\n    :hasUnit qudt:Each .\nTrade-offs:\n\nDatatype approach: Pragmatic storage and mapping, but reasoning can’t follow strings to unit classes\nObject property approach: Enables richer unit semantics and reasoning, but requires unit ontology imports\nHybrid approach: Use both for maximum flexibility and backward compatibility\n\n\n\n\nDecision: We use W3ID-based IRIs with semantic versioning. See ADR-003: IRI and Versioning Policy for the complete rationale and alternatives considered.\n\n\nBase IRI: https://w3id.org/dfo/salmon#\nClass IRIs: https://w3id.org/dfo/salmon#ClassName Property IRIs: https://w3id.org/dfo/salmon#propertyName Instance IRIs: https://w3id.org/dfo/salmon#InstanceName\nExample:\n@prefix dfo: &lt;https://w3id.org/dfo/salmon#&gt; .\n\ndfo:EscapementMeasurement a owl:Class ;\n    rdfs:label \"Escapement Measurement\"@en ;\n    rdfs:comment \"A measurement of salmon escapement\"@en .\n\n\n\nOntology versioning: - Use owl:versionInfo for version numbers - Use owl:versionIRI for version-specific IRIs - Tag releases in GitHub - Maintain changelog\nExample:\n&lt;https://w3id.org/dfo/salmon&gt; a owl:Ontology ;\n    owl:versionInfo \"1.0.0\" ;\n    owl:versionIRI &lt;https://w3id.org/dfo/salmon/1.0.0&gt; ;\n    rdfs:label \"DFO Salmon Ontology\"@en .\n\n\n\n\nWhy use templates? Spreadsheet templates help domain experts contribute terms without needing to learn OWL syntax. They also ensure consistency and completeness.\nTemplate columns:\n\nTerm Name: The name of the term\nType: Class, ObjectProperty, DatatypeProperty, or SKOS Concept\nLabel: Human-readable name\nDefinition: Clear definition\nParent: Parent class or broader concept\nSource: Where the definition came from\nExample: Usage example\nNotes: Additional comments\n\nExample template row: | Term Name | Type | Label | Definition | Parent | Source | Example | Notes | |———–|——|——-|————|——–|——–|———|——-| | EscapementMeasurement | Class | Escapement Measurement | A measurement of salmon escapement | Measurement | DFO protocols 2024 | Sonar count of 1,250 fish | Must link to stock and method |\n\n\n\nWhy follow Darwin Core?

    "text": "What are classes? Classes represent categories or types of things in your domain. For example, “Stock”, “SurveyEvent”, and “GeneticSample” are all classes. They’re like the nouns in your vocabulary.\nWhat are properties? Properties describe relationships between things or attributes of things. For example, “aboutStock” describes which stock a measurement is about, and “usesMethod” describes which method was used.\nWhat are instances? Instances are specific examples of classes. For example, “SkeenaSockeye” is an instance of the “Stock” class.\n\n\n\nCritical Rule: Keep the Ontology File Clean\nThe dfo-salmon.ttl file must contain schema elements only - no instance data. This separation is essential for maintainability, versioning, and interoperability.\nWhat Goes in the Ontology File (dfo-salmon.ttl):\n\nOWL Classes: EscapementSurveyEvent, Stock, Measurement\nOWL Properties: usesEnumerationMethod, aboutStock, hasCountValue\nSKOS Concepts: SnorkelSurvey, Type2, VISITS\nAxioms and Rules: Class restrictions, equivalence axioms, SHACL shapes\nMetadata: Labels, definitions, sources, examples\n\nWhat Does NOT Go in the Ontology File:\n\nInstance Data: Specific survey events, stock measurements, count values\nTemporal Data: Data from specific years, seasons, or time periods\nLocation-Specific Data: Data tied to specific rivers, regions, or sites\nRaw Measurements: Actual count values, efficiency rates, coverage percentages\n\nWhere to Store Instance Data:\n\nSeparate RDF files: survey-data-2022.ttl, stock-data-2023.ttl\nGraph databases: Neo4j, Amazon Neptune, Apache Jena TDB\nData management systems: Custom applications with RDF storage\n\nExample of Proper Separation:\n# IN dfo-salmon.ttl (Schema Only)\n:EscapementSurveyEvent a owl:Class ;\n    rdfs:label \"Escapement Survey Event\"@en ;\n    rdfs:comment \"A specific survey event with measured parameters\"@en ;\n    rdfs:subClassOf dwc:Event .\n\n:SnorkelSurvey a skos:Concept ;\n    skos:prefLabel \"Visual Snorkel Count\"@en ;\n    skos:definition \"Two or more trained snorkelers conduct standardized passes\"@en .\n\n# IN survey-data-2022.ttl (Instance Data Only)\n:SkeenaSnorkel2022_001 a :EscapementSurveyEvent ;\n    dfo:usesEnumerationMethod :SnorkelSurvey ;\n    dfo:measuredVisits 6 ;\n    dfo:measuredReachCoverage 0.85 ;\n    dwc:eventDate \"2022-08-15\"^^xsd:date .\nBenefits of This Separation:\n\nStable Schema: Ontology changes independently of data updates\nReusable: Same schema can be used for multiple datasets\nMaintainable: Easier to validate and update schema separately\nInteroperable: Other systems can import just the schema\nVersionable: Schema and data can have different versioning cycles\n\nSHACL Validation:\n\nSchema Validation: SHACL shapes in the ontology file validate data structure\nData Validation: Apply SHACL shapes to instance data files\nQuality Assurance: Ensures data conforms to schema requirements\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequired elements for every class:\n\nType declaration: a owl:Class - This tells the system this is a class\nLabel: rdfs:label \"Human Name\"@en - A human-readable name in English\nDefinition: rdfs:comment \"1–2 sentence definition.\"@en - A clear explanation of what this class represents\nSource attribution: rdfs:isDefinedBy &lt;https://w3id.org/dfo/salmon&gt; - Links back to our ontology\n\nWhy these are required: Labels help humans understand what you mean, definitions prevent confusion about scope, and source attribution ensures proper credit and traceability.\nExample:\n:GeneticSample a owl:Class ;\n    rdfs:label \"Genetic Sample\"@en ;\n    rdfs:comment \"Tissue or material used in genetic stock identification analyses.\"@en ;\n    rdfs:isDefinedBy &lt;https://w3id.org/dfo/salmon&gt; ;\n    dcterms:source \"DFO Molecular Genetics Lab glossary 2024\" ;\n    oboInOwl:hasExactSynonym \"DNA sample\"@en .\n\n\n\nWhat are object properties? Object properties link instances of one class to instances of another class. For example, “aboutStock” links a measurement to a stock.\nRequired elements for every object property:\n\nType declaration: a owl:ObjectProperty\nLabel: rdfs:label \"Human Name\"@en\nDefinition: rdfs:comment \"1–2 sentence definition.\"@en\nSource attribution: rdfs:isDefinedBy &lt;https://w3id.org/dfo/salmon&gt;\n\nOptional but recommended:\n\nDomain: rdfs:domain :ClassName - What type of thing this property describes\nRange: rdfs:range :ClassName - What type of thing this property points to\nSource: dcterms:source \"Reference to where this came from\"\nExample: dcterms:description \"Example usage\"\n\nOBO annotation properties:\n\nDefinition: oboInOwl:hasDefinition - Formal definition\nExact synonym: oboInOwl:hasExactSynonym - Alternative names with same meaning\nRelated synonym: oboInOwl:hasRelatedSynonym - Related but not identical terms\nBroad synonym: oboInOwl:hasBroadSynonym - More general terms\nNarrow synonym: oboInOwl:hasNarrowSynonym - More specific terms\nDatabase cross-reference: oboInOwl:hasDbXref - Links to external databases\n\nExample:\n:aboutStock a owl:ObjectProperty ;\n    rdfs:label \"about stock\"@en ;\n    rdfs:comment \"Links a measurement or observation to the specific stock it describes.\"@en ;\n    rdfs:domain :Measurement ;\n    rdfs:range :Stock ;\n    rdfs:isDefinedBy &lt;https://w3id.org/dfo/salmon&gt; ;\n    dcterms:source \"DFO stock assessment protocols 2024\" .\n\n\n\nWhat are datatype properties? Datatype properties link instances to literal values (text, numbers, dates). For example, “measurementValue” links a measurement to its numeric value.\nRequired elements for every datatype property:\n\nType declaration: a owl:DatatypeProperty\nLabel: rdfs:label \"Human Name\"@en\nDefinition: rdfs:comment \"1–2 sentence definition.\"@en\nSource attribution: rdfs:isDefinedBy &lt;https://w3id.org/dfo/salmon&gt;\n\nOptional but recommended:\n\nDomain: rdfs:domain :ClassName\nRange: rdfs:range xsd:datatype (e.g., xsd:string, xsd:integer, xsd:date)\nSource: dcterms:source \"Reference to where this came from\"\n\nExample:\n:measurementValue a owl:DatatypeProperty ;\n    rdfs:label \"measurement value\"@en ;\n    rdfs:comment \"The numeric value of a measurement.\"@en ;\n    rdfs:domain :Measurement ;\n    rdfs:range xsd:decimal ;\n    rdfs:isDefinedBy &lt;https://w3id.org/dfo/salmon&gt; .\n\n\n\nWhat are SKOS concepts? SKOS concepts are for controlled vocabularies - lists of standardized terms like methods, categories, or codes. Use SKOS when you need a picklist rather than a complex class hierarchy.\nTerminology vs Ontology:\n\nTerminology: A collection of terms with definitions and synonyms (like a dictionary)\nOntology: A formal classification with logical relationships between terms (like a structured knowledge base)\nOur approach: We use OWL for formal relationships and SKOS for simple controlled vocabularies\n\nRequired elements for every SKOS concept:\n\nType declaration: a skos:Concept\nLabel: skos:prefLabel \"Human Name\"@en\nDefinition: skos:definition \"1–2 sentence definition.\"@en\nSource attribution: rdfs:isDefinedBy &lt;https://w3id.org/dfo/salmon&gt;\n\nNote on ROBOT Validation: ROBOT reports missing rdfs:label for SKOS concepts that have skos:prefLabel. This is a ROBOT limitation - per W3C SKOS specification, skos:prefLabel is a subproperty of rdfs:label, so these concepts ARE properly labeled. Do not add redundant rdfs:label properties to satisfy ROBOT.\nExample:\n:SonarCounting a skos:Concept ;\n    skos:prefLabel \"Sonar Counting\"@en ;\n    skos:definition \"Method of counting fish using sonar technology.\"@en ;\n    rdfs:isDefinedBy &lt;https://w3id.org/dfo/salmon&gt; ;\n    skos:broader :CountingMethod .\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo ensure consistent provenance documentation and FAIR compliance, follow these conventions when citing the source of a definition, dataset, or external standard:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProperty\nPurpose\nExpected Value Type\nExample Use\n\n\n\n\ndcterms:source\nPersistent identifier (DOI/Handle/w3id/ARK) for the source resource.\nIRI\n&lt;https://doi.org/10.1234/dfostock.2023&gt;\n\n\ndcterms:bibliographicCitation\nHuman-readable citation text for the source.\nLiteral (string)\n\"DFO (2023).

See ADR-005: External Vocabulary Integration Strategy for the complete rationale and alternatives considered.\nImplementation:\n\n\nMethod: 1. Copy the term IRI (e.g., bfo:0000015) 2. Add minimal metadata: rdfs:label, oboInOwl:hasDefinition (or rdfs:comment) 3. Add rdfs:isDefinedBy pointing to source ontology 4. Use the term as if it were native\nExample - BFO MIREOT:\n# Import specific BFO term via MIREOT\nbfo:0000015 a owl:Class ;\n  rdfs:label \"process\"@en ;\n  oboInOwl:hasDefinition \"An occurrent that has temporal parts.\"@en ;\n  rdfs:isDefinedBy &lt;http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/bfo.owl&gt; .\n\n# Now use it in your ontology\ndfo:StatusAssessment rdfs:subPropertyOf bfo:0000015 .  # process\nDFO Salmon MIREOT Terms: - BFO (3 terms): process, material entity, generically dependent continuant - IAO (4 terms): measurement datum, value specification, information content entity, directive information entity - DQV (5 terms): Dimension, QualityAnnotation, inDimension, Metric, Category\n\n\n\nWe use BFO as our upper ontology to anchor classes in a coherent hierarchy of continuants (e.g., stocks, samples) versus occurrents (events, processes). This improves consistency (no class should represent both a thing and an event) and aligns with OBO Foundry best practices. To keep the ontology lightweight, we MIREOT only a small set of BFO classes (e.g., process, material entity, generically dependent continuant) needed for high-level placement and documentation.\nNote: This short rationale summarizes the why. If expanded with alternatives and trade-offs, consider capturing it as a dedicated ADR.\nDwC positioning: The Darwin Core Conceptual Model is treated as a domain‑specific mid‑level model beneath BFO. We align DwC classes under appropriate BFO categories (e.g., dwc:Event ≈ BFO process; dwc:Organism ≈ BFO material entity; dwc:Assertion/occurrence records ≈ information content entities, when used that way), then subclass our domain classes under DwC terms.\n\n\n\nMethod: 1. Declare prefix: @prefix prov: &lt;http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#&gt; 2. Use terms directly in your ontology 3. No local definitions needed 4. Assumes external ontology is accessible\nExample - PROV-O Prefix Only:\n# Declare prefix (no import, no local definitions)\n@prefix prov: &lt;http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#&gt; .\n\n# Use PROV-O properties directly\n:BarkleyStatus2025 prov:used :EscapementDataset2025 ;\n  prov:wasGeneratedBy :SRBenchmarkMethod ;\n  prov:wasAttributedTo :StockAssessmentTeam .\nDFO Salmon Prefix-Only: - PROV-O (~6 properties): wasGeneratedBy, wasDerivedFrom, used, wasAttributedTo, etc. - RO (alignment via rdfs:seeAlso): has_member, member_of - SKOS (extensive): Concept, ConceptScheme, prefLabel, definition, etc. - DwC (extensive): Event, Organism, Assertion, MaterialSample, etc.\n\n\n\n\nBFO (upper ontology): Retain as the top‑level; MIREOT only core classes (process, material entity, site) and assert domain classes under them for clarity.\nIAO (information artifacts): Use for documents and information entities (e.g., FSAR, advice text). MIREOT only needed terms; model dfo:ScientificOutput ⊑ iao:0000030 (information content entity).\nDarwin Core (domain scaffolding): Subclass DFO domain classes under DwC (e.g., dfo:SurveyEvent ⊑ dwc:Event, dfo:StatusAssessment ⊑ dwc:Assertion). Treat DwC as mid‑level beneath BFO.\nSchema.org and DCAT (web/catalog): Keep dfo:Dataset ⊑ schema:Dataset; optionally align dfo:Dataset ⊑ dcat:Dataset for catalog compatibility; use DCAT properties (e.g., distributions) when publishing catalogs.\nPROV‑O (provenance): Prefix‑only; use relations (prov:used, prov:wasGeneratedBy, prov:wasDerivedFrom) without importing full classes.\nDQV (quality): Use dqv:QualityAnnotation and dqv:inDimension for evidence/quality badges; MIREOT minimal core.\nDPROD (data products): Evaluate post‑MVP; likely align dfo:Dataset ⊑ dprod:Dataset and describe services/distributions via DPROD.\nRO (relations): Prefer RO for fundamental relations; align custom properties as subproperties of RO (see 6.6).\nOBI (protocols/assays): Import specific terms only when clearly beneficial; avoid heavy imports.\nENVO (environment): Use selectively for habitat/environment terms as annotations or links.\nORG (organizations): Prefix‑only; use org:Organization/units for decision‑maker modeling.\n\n\n\n\nWhen to use MIREOT: - Need 3-20 specific terms with labels/definitions - Want documentation in your ontology - Don’t need reasoning over the full imported ontology\nWhen to use prefix-only: - Using properties only (not classes) - Terms are universally known (SKOS, Dublin Core) - Pure data typing (xsd:) - Lightweight alignment without local definitions\nWhen NOT to use full imports: - Avoid importing entire external ontologies (100s-1000s of terms) - Causes slow loading and reasoning - Potential conflicts with other imports\n\n\n\n\nWe use PROV-O for provenance and DQV for quality annotations that back UI badges and evidence checks.\nExample (illustrative Turtle):\n:Assessment_X a dfo:StatusAssessment ;\n  prov:used :Dataset_Y ;\n  prov:wasGeneratedBy :AnalysisMethod_Z ;\n  prov:wasDerivedFrom :ReferencePoint_Q .\n\n:ReferencePoint_Q a dfo:ReferencePoint ;\n  dfo:refPointType :LRP .\n\n:Assessment_X_EvidenceComplete a dfo:CompleteEvidence ;\n  dqv:inDimension dfo:EvidenceCompletenessDimension .\n\n:Assessment_X dqv:hasQualityAnnotation :Assessment_X_EvidenceComplete .\nHow to apply:\n\nBefore finalizing an assessment, attach a quality annotation indicating evidence state: dfo:CompleteEvidence, dfo:GapsEvidence, or dfo:MissingCriticalEvidence, linked by dqv:hasQualityAnnotation and categorized via dqv:inDimension.\nUse prov:used, prov:wasGeneratedBy, and prov:wasDerivedFrom to record datasets, methods, and reference points underpinning the assessment.\n\nUncertainty properties:\n\nFor GSI composition measurements, record sample size via dfo:gsi_sample_size and 95% CI via dfo:gsi_ci (per GRD integration schema). Shapes in 2.5 can require these when applicable and flag omissions.\n\n\n\n\nUse this decision guide to choose the right modeling primitive:\n\nSKOS Concept\n\nUse for controlled vocabulary/code-list values that don’t need logical axioms or subclass hierarchies.\nExamples: spawner_origin values (:Wild, :Hatchery), data_source_type, reference_point_type, decision_type, status zone values (:RedZone, :AmberZone, :GreenZone), enumeration methods (:SnorkelSurvey, :SonarCounting), and estimate methods (:AreaUnderCurve, :FixedStationTally).\nPattern: Use an object property whose range is skos:Concept (e.g., dfo:statusZone → skos:Concept, dfo:usesEnumerationMethod → skos:Concept).\n\nOWL Class\n\nUse for fundamental domain entities or when hierarchy/specialization is needed.\nExamples: dfo:ConservationUnit, dfo:Stock, dfo:StatusAssessment, dfo:EscapementMethod (methodological families for classification purposes).\nNote: Enumeration and estimate methods (specific methods like Snorkel Survey, Area Under Curve) are modeled as SKOS concepts per ADR-001. The dfo:EscapementMethod OWL class hierarchy represents methodological families for broader classification, distinct from the SKOS enumeration/estimate method vocabularies.\n\nOWL Individual\n\nUse for concrete, real-world instances (lives in data graphs, not the ontology schema file).\nExamples: A specific CU instance (e.g., :NanaimoRiverChinookCU_2024), a policy document (e.g., :WildSalmonPolicy_2005), or a specific survey event instance (e.g., :SkeenaSnorkel2022_001 a :EscapementSurveyEvent).\nNote: Enumeration and estimate methods are SKOS concepts, not individuals. Use the SKOS concepts directly (e.g., :SnorkelSurvey, :AreaUnderCurve) in data instances rather than creating method instances.\nNaming recommendation: PascalCase with disambiguators as needed (:SkeenaSnorkel2022_001, :SkeenaSockeye), or a short path-like fragment (#Stock/SkeenaSockeye). Avoid spaces; prefer stable, meaningful identifiers.\n\n\nDo not duplicate the same concept as both an OWL class and a SKOS concept (or an individual) unless there is a deliberate bridge/mapping with documented rationale. Choose one approach based on the above rules to avoid ambiguity.\n\n\n\nDecision: We use a hybrid approach combining OWL and SKOS for classification. Automated approaches are deferred; see ADR-001: Hybrid OWL+SKOS Modeling Approach for the complete rationale and alternatives considered.\nImplementation:\nFour-Layer Architecture:\n\nMethods as SKOS Concepts - Enumeration and estimation methods are SKOS concepts in controlled vocabularies (e.g., :SnorkelSurvey, :SonarCounting, :AreaUnderCurve, :FixedStationTally).\nEvents as OWL Classes - Survey/estimate events that extend Darwin Core Event\nMetadata on Events - Rich data about how methods were applied in specific surveys\nDowngrade Criteria as SKOS - Standardized criteria for type assignment (manual now; automation later)\n\nComplete Example:\n# Layer 1: SKOS Methods (Controlled Vocabularies)\n:SnorkelSurvey a skos:Concept ;\n    skos:prefLabel \"Visual Snorkel Count\"@en ;\n    skos:definition \"Two or more trained snorkelers conduct standardized passes within defined segments\"@en ;\n    skos:inScheme :EnumerationMethodScheme ;\n    skos:broader :EnumerationMethod .\n\n:AreaUnderCurve a skos:Concept ;\n    skos:prefLabel \"Area Under the Curve (AUC)\"@en ;\n    skos:definition \"Integrates serial counts over time using a survey-life parameter\"@en ;\n    skos:inScheme :EstimateMethodScheme ;\n    skos:broader :EstimateMethod .\n\n# Layer 2: SKOS Downgrade Criteria\n:VISITS a skos:Concept ;\n    skos:prefLabel \"Number of visits\"@en ;\n    skos:definition \"Too few site visits for the claimed precision tier\"@en ;\n    skos:inScheme :DowngradeCriteriaScheme .\n\n:REACH_COVERAGE a skos:Concept ;\n    skos:prefLabel \"Spatial coverage\"@en ;\n    skos:definition \"Fraction of intended reaches/segments not surveyed\"@en ;\n    skos:inScheme :DowngradeCriteriaScheme .\n\n# Layer 3: OWL Event Classes\n:EscapementSurveyEvent a owl:Class ;\n    rdfs:label \"Escapement Survey Event\"@en ;\n    rdfs:comment \"A specific survey event with measured parameters\"@en ;\n    rdfs:subClassOf dwc:Event ;\n    rdfs:isDefinedBy &lt;https://w3id.org/dfo/salmon&gt; .\n\n# Layer 4: Event Instance with Metadata\n:SkeenaSnorkel2022_001 a :EscapementSurveyEvent ;\n    rdfs:label \"Skeena Snorkel Survey 2022-001\"@en ;\n    dfo:usesEnumerationMethod :SnorkelSurvey ;\n    dfo:usesEstimateMethod :AreaUnderCurve ;\n    dfo:measuredVisits 6 ;\n    dfo:measuredReachCoverage 0.85 ;\n    dfo:measuredVisibility :Good ;\n    dfo:measuredObserverEfficiency 0.8 ;\n    dfo:percentRiverSwam 0.75 ;\n    dfo:hasDocumentation :SIL_2022_001 ;\n    dfo:hasQAReport :QA_2022_001 ;\n    dfo:downgradeCriteriaMet :VISIBILITY, :REACH_COVERAGE ;\n    dwc:eventDate \"2022-08-15\"^^xsd:date ;\n    dwc:samplingProtocol :DFOSnorkelProtocol ;\n    rdfs:isDefinedBy &lt;https://w3id.org/dfo/salmon&gt; .\nKey Principles:\n\nMethods are vocabulary terms - Use SKOS for enumeration methods, estimate methods, and downgrade criteria\nEvents carry the data - OWL classes for survey events with rich metadata properties\nMetadata on instances - Observer efficiency, coverage, visibility are properties of specific surveys\nClassification (current) - Estimate types are manually assigned based on criteria; SHACL flags inconsistencies. Automated classification is deferred (see 2.5).\n\n\n\n\nSKOS concepts are used strictly for controlled lists (e.g., categories, downgrade criteria, status zones) and must not be treated as OWL classes in axioms.\nDo not assert or infer SKOS concepts as owl:Class or use them as class expressions in restrictions.\n\nWhat not to do (anti-pattern):\n# ❌ Do NOT model a SKOS concept as an OWL class\n:RedZone a owl:Class .\n\n# ❌ Do NOT use a SKOS concept as if it were an OWL class in restrictions\n:EscapementSurveyEvent rdfs:subClassOf [\n  a owl:Restriction ;\n  owl:onProperty dfo:usesEnumerationMethod ;\n  owl:allValuesFrom :RedZone  # :RedZone should be a skos:Concept, not a class\n] .\nCorrect usage (pattern):\n# ✅ Keep :RedZone as a SKOS concept in a concept scheme\n:RedZone a skos:Concept ;\n  skos:prefLabel \"Red Zone\"@en ;\n  skos:inScheme :StatusZoneScheme .\n\n# ✅ Constrain with SHACL or document as guidance; keep OWL domain/range on properties\n:statusZone a owl:ObjectProperty ;\n  rdfs:domain :StatusAssessment ;\n  rdfs:range skos:Concept .\nWhy: Per SKOS and OWL best practices (W3C SKOS Reference) and community guidance (e.g., Steven Baskauf), mixing SKOS individuals as OWL classes leads to punning and can break OWL DL reasoning assumptions. Keep SKOS for terminology, OWL for logical class hierarchies.\n\n\n\n\nWhy SHACL? SHACL (Shapes Constraint Language) provides validation rules that can enforce data quality and ensure required fields are present. It separates data validation from classification logic. In our stack, shapes are used for validation only, not for inference or automated classification.\nNote: Estimate types are manually assigned based on Hyatt 1997 criteria. Automated classification is deferred to post-MVP.\nSHACL Shape for Method Validation:\n# SHACL Shape for Snorkel Survey Events\n:SnorkelSurveyShape a sh:NodeShape ;\n    sh:targetClass :EscapementSurveyEvent ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path dfo:usesEnumerationMethod ;\n        sh:hasValue :SnorkelSurvey ;\n        sh:message \"Survey must use snorkel enumeration method\"\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path dfo:measuredVisits ;\n        sh:datatype xsd:integer ;\n        sh:minInclusive 1 ;\n        sh:message \"Number of visits must be a positive integer\"\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path dfo:measuredReachCoverage ;\n        sh:datatype xsd:decimal ;\n        sh:minInclusive 0.0 ;\n        sh:maxInclusive 1.0 ;\n        sh:message \"Reach coverage must be between 0.0 and 1.0\"\n    ] ;\n    sh:property [\n        sh:path dfo:measuredVisibility ;\n        sh:in ( :Excellent :Good :Fair :Poor ) ;\n        sh:message \"Visibility must be one of: Excellent, Good, Fair, Poor\"\n    ] .\nImplementation Pipeline:\n\nData Entry - Users create survey events with metadata\nSHACL Validation - Ensures required fields are present and valid\nManual Classification - Estimate types assigned based on Hyatt 1997 criteria\nQuality Assessment - Review data completeness and quality\n\n\n\n\nClasses: Use PascalCase (e.g., EscapementMeasurement, GeneticSample) Properties: Use lowerCamelCase (e.g., aboutStock, usesMethod, hasMember) SKOS Concepts: Use PascalCase (e.g., SonarCounting, MicrosatelliteAssay) Instances: Use PascalCase with descriptive names (e.g., SkeenaSockeye, FraserCoho)\nWhy consistent naming matters: It makes the ontology easier to read, understand, and maintain. It also helps prevent confusion when multiple people are contributing."

    "text": "Why integrate with Darwin Core? Darwin Core provides a widely-adopted standard for biodiversity data that enables interoperability with GBIF, OBIS, and other international biodiversity platforms. By aligning with Darwin Core, your salmon data becomes discoverable and usable by the broader scientific community.\n\n📋 Complete Darwin Core Integration: See the DFO Salmon Ontology: Product Requirements Document for the complete technical approach, including hybrid modeling strategy, core patterns, and Darwin Core integration details.\n\nKey Darwin Core Classes to Use:\n\ndwc:Event - Actions, processes, or circumstances occurring at a place and time\ndwc:Occurrence - A state of an organism in an event\ndwc:Organism - A particular organism or defined group of organisms\ndwc:MaterialSample - Physical samples that can be identified and managed\ndwc:Identification - Taxonomic determinations of organisms\n[DwC-CM] dwc:Assertion (under review) - A generalized assertion (e.g., measurement/occurrence) with provenance\ndwc:Agent - People, groups, organizations, machines, or software that can act\ndwc:Media - Digital media (images, videos, sounds, text)\ndwc:Protocol - Methods used during actions\n\nDFO Extensions:\n# DFO-specific classes that extend Darwin Core\ndfo:ManagementUnit rdfs:subClassOf dwc:Event ;\n    rdfs:label \"Management Unit\"@en ;\n    rdfs:comment \"A geographic or administrative unit for salmon management\"@en .\n\ndfo:ConservationUnit rdfs:subClassOf dwc:Event ;\n    rdfs:label \"Conservation Unit\"@en ;\n    rdfs:comment \"A biologically meaningful unit for conservation planning\"@en .\n\ndfo:Stock rdfs:subClassOf dwc:Organism ;\n    rdfs:label \"Stock\"@en ;\n    rdfs:comment \"A population of salmon with distinct characteristics\"@en .\n\n\nWe align to the Darwin Core Conceptual Model (DwC-CM, under review) as our domain frame for biodiversity data. DwC-CM is treated as a mid-level model beneath our upper ontology (BFO):\n\nOperational entities are dwc:Event-based (surveys, analyses, runs) to preserve time/place semantics; we align these to BFO processes.\nDeterminations and derived statements use dwc:Assertion where supported. We do not model or export legacy dwc:MeasurementOrFact.\nOrganismal and occurrence context is explicit via dwc:Organism and dwc:Occurrence when needed by integration partners.\n\nDFO specializations (illustrative):\n\ndfo:EscapementSurveyEvent rdfs:subClassOf dwc:Event\ndfo:GSIRun rdfs:subClassOf dwc:Event\ndfo:Stock rdfs:subClassOf dwc:Organism\ndfo:StatusAssessment rdfs:subClassOf dwc:Assertion (DwC-CM)\n\nEarly adopter note: We consciously apply DwC terms per the conceptual model under review, making this ontology among early adopters of DwC’s semantic layer. Where terms or ranges are still stabilizing, we document assumptions and keep changes localized via an anti‑corruption layer.\n\n\n\nFor teams familiar with DwC tabular packages, here is a minimal mapping to DFO classes/properties:\n\nEvent core (event.txt)\n\neventID → IRI of dfo:EscapementSurveyEvent or dfo:GSIRun\neventDate, parentEventID, locationID → time/place nesting for events\nsamplingProtocol → dfo:usesEnumerationMethod or dfo:usedAssay (DFO properties)\n\nExtension: Occurrence (occurrence.txt) when organismal presence is explicit\n\noccurrenceID → occurrence instance IRI\norganismID → dfo:Stock (linked via dfo:aboutStock in graph exports)\n\nExtension: Assertions (assertion.txt; DwC-CM)\n\nassertionID → IRI of dfo:StatusAssessment (as dwc:Assertion)\nsubjectID → assessed entity (CU/SMU)\npredicate/object → status/benchmark outcomes (or typed properties in RDF)\nProvenance → see PROV usage in Section 2.3.7\n\n\nThis outline aims to let DwC users quickly map DFO semantics onto familiar DwC package structures while preserving richer semantics in RDF/JSON-LD.\n\n\n\nContext: The Darwin Core Conceptual Model (DwC-CM) provides a semantic layer for Darwin Core that addresses long-standing ambiguities and provides clearer class definitions and relationships. DFO Salmon Ontology implements DwC-CM patterns for improved interoperability and semantic clarity.\n\n\nOccurrence Usage: - Definition: dwc:Occurrence is explicitly defined as “a state of an Organism in an Event” - DFO Usage: Use dwc:Occurrence when modeling individual fish observations (e.g., genetic sampling data where each fish sampled is an Occurrence of that fish at the sampling event) - Aggregate Data: For aggregate data (escapement counts, surveys), use dwc:Event and dwc:Assertion patterns - Avoid: Conflating Occurrence with Event or with Organism\nAssertion Class Implementation: - Purpose: dwc:Assertion replaces dwc:MeasurementOrFact with clearer semantics - DFO Implementation: dfo:EscapementMeasurement ⊑ dwc:Assertion and dfo:GSICompositionMeasurement ⊑ dwc:Assertion - Benefits: Better semantic clarity, improved interoperability, alignment with modern DwC practices\nStructured Relationships: - Property Domains/Ranges: DwC-CM defines which properties apply to which classes with clear domain/range expectations - DFO Alignment: DFO property usage aligns with DwC-CM constraints (e.g., dwc:eventDate on events, dwc:measurementValue on assertions)\n\n\n\nFor Measurements: - Use dwc:Assertion as superclass for all measurement classes - Ensure dwc:measurementType, dwc:measurementValue, dwc:measurementUnit are used appropriately - Document the assertion pattern for measurements\nFor Events: - Use dwc:Event as superclass for survey events - Use dwc:parentEventID for event hierarchies when appropriate - Ensure dwc:eventDate is used on event classes\nFor Organisms: - Use dwc:Organism for stock classes - Use dwc:Occurrence for individual organism observations (when applicable) - Use dwc:MaterialEntity for physical samples\nFor Data Packages: - Structure exports to align with DwC-CM classes - Include proper metadata for dataset descriptions - Ensure reference links exist between related entities\n\n\n\n\n\nPrefer existing DwC classes when semantics match before creating a new class. Example: use dwc:MaterialEntity for tangible sample artifacts rather than introducing a parallel dfo:Sample.\nWe typically subclass domain-specific classes under DwC terms (e.g., dfo:EscapementSurveyEvent ⊑ dwc:Event). We rarely use dwc:Assertion directly in schema; assertions arise by inference from specialized subclasses and are represented in data exports.\nPresence/absence and similar observation concepts may use dwc:Occurrence if/when these data are integrated. Coordinate with ontology leads before modeling new observational patterns.\nWhen a needed concept appears to overlap with DwC, open a discussion/issue or an ADR proposal to document rationale and trade-offs.\nDwC-CM Alignment: Ensure new terms align with DwC-CM patterns and use dwc:Assertion for measurement classes."

    "text": "What are competency questions? These are the specific questions your ontology should be able to answer.

This pattern represents the hierarchical relationship between Management Units, Conservation Units, and Stocks in salmon management.\nThe Pattern:\n\nManagement Units contain Conservation Units\nConservation Units contain Stocks\nUse transitive hasMember relationships\nCreate type-specific subproperties for clarity\n\nImplementation:\n# Define the base membership property\n:hasMember a owl:ObjectProperty, owl:TransitiveProperty ;\n    rdfs:label \"has member\"@en ;\n    rdfs:comment \"A transitive relationship indicating membership in a group\"@en .\n\n# Define type-specific subproperties\n:hasMemberCU rdfs:subPropertyOf :hasMember ;\n    rdfs:label \"has member conservation unit\"@en ;\n    rdfs:domain :ManagementUnit ;\n    rdfs:range :ConservationUnit .\n\n:hasMemberStock rdfs:subPropertyOf :hasMember ;\n    rdfs:label \"has member stock\"@en ;\n    rdfs:domain :ConservationUnit ;\n    rdfs:range :Stock .\n\n# Example usage\n:BCInteriorMU a :ManagementUnit ;\n    :hasMemberCU :FraserCUCoho .\n\n:FraserCUCoho a :ConservationUnit ;\n    :hasMemberStock :FraserCohoStock .\n\n# Transitive inference: BCInteriorMU hasMember FraserCohoStock\n\n\n\n\n\nRequired elements for every escapement measurement:\n\ndwc:measurementType - What was measured (e.g., “abundance”)\ndwc:measurementValue - The measured value\ndwc:measurementUnit - The unit of measurement (QUDT IRI)\ndfo:aboutStock - Which stock it describes\ndfo:observedDuring - Which event it was collected during\ndfo:usesMethod - Which method was used\n\nExample:\n:EscapementCount2022 a :EscapementMeasurement ;\n    dwc:measurementType \"abundance\" ;\n    dwc:measurementValue \"1250\"^^xsd:integer ;\n    dwc:measurementUnit \"http://qudt.org/vocab/unit/Each\" ;\n    dfo:aboutStock :SkeenaSockeye ;\n    dfo:observedDuring :SkeenaSurvey2022 ;\n    dfo:usesMethod :SonarCounting .\n\n\n\nRequired elements for every GSI measurement:\n\ndfo:aboutReportingUnit - Which genetic reporting unit\ndfo:proportion - The proportion of the sample\ndfo:confidence - Confidence interval or quality measure\ndfo:analyzedIn - Which GSI run produced this result\ndfo:basedOnSamples - Which samples were analyzed\n\nExample:\n:GSIResult2023_001 a :GSICompositionMeasurement ;\n    dfo:aboutReportingUnit :FraserSockeyeRU ;\n    dfo:proportion \"0.85\"^^xsd:decimal ;\n    dfo:confidence \"0.02\"^^xsd:decimal ;\n    dfo:analyzedIn :GSIRun2023_001 ;\n    dfo:basedOnSamples :SampleSet2023_001 .\n\n\n\n\nWhy external alignments matter: They ensure your ontology can work with other systems and datasets, making your data more discoverable and useful.\nKey external vocabularies:\n\nQUDT: Units of measurement (http://qudt.org/vocab/unit/)\nENVO: Environmental terms (http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_)\nGBIF Backbone: Taxonomic names (http://www.gbif.org/species/)\nDarwin Core: Biodiversity data standards (http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/)\nRO (Relations Ontology): Standard relations (http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_)\nAGROVOC: Agricultural/fisheries thesaurus for common concepts (https://agrovoc.fao.org/)\nSchema.org/DCAT: Web and catalog vocabularies for datasets and distributions\nIAO: Information artifact ontology for documents and datasets\nORG: Organizational structure and units (https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-org/)\n\nOBO Foundry Relation Reuse Requirements:\n\nCheck RO first: Before defining new relations, check if equivalent relations exist in RO\nUse RO IRIs: When equivalent relations exist, use the RO IRI directly or create subproperties\nAvoid label conflicts: OBO Foundry review flags non-RO relations with RO-equivalent labels\nSubproperty alignment: Create subproperties of RO relations when domain-specific extensions are needed\n\nExample RO Alignment:\n# Instead of defining a new \"hasMember\" property, align with RO\n:hasMember rdfs:subPropertyOf ro:has_part ;\n    rdfs:label \"has member\"@en ;\n    rdfs:comment \"A transitive relationship indicating membership in a group\"@en .\n\n# Or use RO directly when appropriate\n:populationOf ro:part_of :stock ;\n    rdfs:label \"population of\"@en .\nImplementation:\n\nStore external IRIs as literals in …UnitIRI properties\nUse dcterms:source to reference external vocabularies\nPlan to convert to object properties in future versions\nCheck RO for existing relations before defining new ones\n\nPractical guidance for new relationships:\n\nBefore minting a custom property like partOfRiver, prefer the generic RO property ro:part_of and model “river” via the class hierarchy (e.g., dfo:RiverSegment).\nWhen a domain-specific refinement is needed, define a custom subproperty aligned to RO (e.g., dfo:hasMemberCU rdfs:subPropertyOf ro:has_part). This keeps reasoning consistent and improves interoperability.\n\nUnit Property Enhancement (Non-breaking): For richer unit semantics, consider adding object properties alongside datatype properties:\n# Current approach: Store QUDT IRIs as literals\n:measurementUnitIRI a owl:DatatypeProperty ;\n    rdfs:label \"measurement unit IRI\"@en ;\n    rdfs:comment \"IRI of the unit used in a measurement\"@en ;\n    rdfs:domain :Measurement ;\n    rdfs:range xsd:anyURI .\n\n# Enhanced approach: Add object property for reasoning\n:hasUnit a owl:ObjectProperty ;\n    rdfs:label \"has unit\"@en ;\n    rdfs:comment \"Links a measurement to a unit (e.g., QUDT Unit)\"@en ;\n    rdfs:domain :Measurement ;\n    rdfs:range qudt:Unit ;\n    rdfs:isDefinedBy &lt;https://w3id.org/dfo/salmon&gt; .\n\n# Example usage with both approaches\n:EscapementCount2022 a :EscapementMeasurement ;\n    :measurementUnitIRI \"http://qudt.org/vocab/unit/Each\"^^xsd:anyURI ;\n    :hasUnit qudt:Each .\nTrade-offs:\n\nDatatype approach: Pragmatic storage and mapping, but reasoning can’t follow strings to unit classes\nObject property approach: Enables richer unit semantics and reasoning, but requires unit ontology imports\nHybrid approach: Use both for maximum flexibility and backward compatibility\n\n\n\n\nDecision: We use W3ID-based IRIs with semantic versioning. See ADR-003: IRI and Versioning Policy for the complete rationale and alternatives considered.\n\n\nBase IRI: https://w3id.org/dfo/salmon#\nClass IRIs: https://w3id.org/dfo/salmon#ClassName Property IRIs: https://w3id.org/dfo/salmon#propertyName Instance IRIs: https://w3id.org/dfo/salmon#InstanceName\nExample:\n@prefix dfo: &lt;https://w3id.org/dfo/salmon#&gt; .\n\ndfo:EscapementMeasurement a owl:Class ;\n    rdfs:label \"Escapement Measurement\"@en ;\n    rdfs:comment \"A measurement of salmon escapement\"@en .\n\n\n\nOntology versioning: - Use owl:versionInfo for version numbers - Use owl:versionIRI for version-specific IRIs - Tag releases in GitHub - Maintain changelog\nExample:\n&lt;https://w3id.org/dfo/salmon&gt; a owl:Ontology ;\n    owl:versionInfo \"1.0.0\" ;\n    owl:versionIRI &lt;https://w3id.org/dfo/salmon/1.0.0&gt; ;\n    rdfs:label \"DFO Salmon Ontology\"@en .\n\n\n\n\nWhy use templates? Spreadsheet templates help domain experts contribute terms without needing to learn OWL syntax. They also ensure consistency and completeness.\nTemplate columns:\n\nTerm Name: The name of the term\nType: Class, ObjectProperty, DatatypeProperty, or SKOS Concept\nLabel: Human-readable name\nDefinition: Clear definition\nParent: Parent class or broader concept\nSource: Where the definition came from\nExample: Usage example\nNotes: Additional comments\n\nExample template row: | Term Name | Type | Label | Definition | Parent | Source | Example | Notes | |———–|——|——-|————|——–|——–|———|——-| | EscapementMeasurement | Class | Escapement Measurement | A measurement of salmon escapement | Measurement | DFO protocols 2024 | Sonar count of 1,250 fish | Must link to stock and method |\n\n\n\nWhy follow Darwin Core? Darwin Core provides a widely-adopted standard for biodiversity data that enables interoperability with GBIF, OBIS, and other international platforms.\n\n📋 Complete Darwin Core Integration: See the DFO Salmon Ontology: Product Requirements Document for the complete technical approach and Darwin Core integration strategy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScenario: Modeling a sonar count of sockeye escapement\nRequired elements:\n\nEvent (when and where the count occurred)\nStock (which stock was counted)\nMethod (sonar counting)\nMeasurement (the count value and unit)\nAgent (who conducted the count)\n\nExample:\n:SkeenaSurvey2023 a eco:Survey ;\n    dwc:eventDate \"2023-08-15\"^^xsd:date ;\n    dwc:samplingProtocol :SonarCountingProtocol ;\n    dwc:recordedBy :DFOFieldTeam .\n\n:SkeenaSockeye a dfo:Stock ;\n    rdfs:label \"Skeena Sockeye\"@en ;\n    rdfs:comment \"Sockeye salmon from the Skeena River watershed\"@en .\n\n:SonarCount2023_08_15 a dfo:EscapementMeasurement ;\n    dwc:measurementType \"abundance\" ;\n    dwc:measurementValue \"1250\"^^xsd:integer ;\n    dwc:measurementUnit \"http://qudt.org/vocab/unit/Each\" ;\n    dfo:aboutStock :SkeenaSockeye ;\n    dfo:observedDuring :SkeenaSurvey2023 ;\n    dfo:usesMethod :SonarCounting .\n\n\n\nScenario: Modeling genetic stock identification results\nRequired elements:\n\nGSI Run (when and how the analysis was performed)\nSamples (what was analyzed)\nReporting Units (genetic populations)\nComposition Results (proportions and confidence)\n\nExample:\n:GSIRun2023_001 a dfo:GSIRun ;\n    dwc:eventDate \"2023-06-15\"^^xsd:date ;\n    dfo:usedAssay :MicrosatelliteAssay ;\n    dfo:usedMarkerPanel :PacificSalmonPanel .\n\n:FraserSockeyeRU a dfo:ReportingUnit ;\n    rdfs:label \"Fraser Sockeye Reporting Unit\"@en ;\n    rdfs:comment \"Genetic reporting unit for Fraser River sockeye\"@en .\n\n:GSIResult2023_001 a dfo:GSICompositionMeasurement ;\n    dfo:aboutReportingUnit :FraserSockeyeRU ;\n    dfo:proportion \"0.85\"^^xsd:decimal ;\n    dfo:confidence \"0.02\"^^xsd:decimal ;\n    dfo:analyzedIn :GSIRun2023_001 .\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore submitting new terms:\n\nSelf-review using competency questions\n\nCan this term answer a specific research question?\nDoes it integrate with existing terms?\nIs it consistent with established patterns?\n\nTechnical validation\n\nRun reasoner to check for logical consistency\nValidate that all required annotations are present\nTest with sample data\n\nCommunity consultation\n\nDiscuss major changes in GitHub Issues\nGet feedback from domain experts\nEnsure alignment with community needs\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to submit new terms:\n\nCreate a GitHub Issue\n\nDescribe the term and its purpose\nExplain how it fits with existing terms\nProvide examples of usage\n\nCreate a Pull Request\n\nInclude the new term in Turtle format\nFollow all naming and annotation conventions\nInclude tests and examples\n\nCommunity Review\n\nAt least two reviewers must approve\nAddress all feedback and concerns\nEnsure quality and consistency\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to handle feedback:\n\nBe responsive: Acknowledge all feedback promptly\nBe collaborative: Work with reviewers to improve terms\nBe thorough: Address all concerns before resubmitting\nBe patient: Good ontology development takes time\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCore class and property definitions\nBasic measurement patterns\nStock hierarchy implementation\nDarwin Core alignment\n\n\n\n\n\nGenetic analysis workflows\nAdvanced measurement types\nExternal vocabulary integration\nQuality control patterns\n\n\n\n\n\nNCEAS Salmon Ontology alignment\nInternational standard compliance\nAdvanced querying capabilities\nData validation tools\n\n\n\n\n\nPolicy benchmarks and reference points\nIntegration with NCEAS Salmon Ontology\nAdvanced querying and analytics"

    "section": "🤔 Why Bother with Controlled Vocabularies and Ontologies?",
    "text": "🤔 Why Bother with Controlled Vocabularies and Ontologies?\nIt’s a fair question. Why invest all this time defining terms, aligning with ontologies, and assigning URIs?\nBecause it unlocks a future where your data works harder for you. Controlled vocabularies and ontologies aren’t just academic exercises — they’re the foundation for better discovery, smarter integration, and automation across the science lifecycle.\nHere are some tangible ways this work adds value:\n\n\n🔍 1. Enhanced Data Discovery\n\n“I know someone collected salmon smolt data… but where do I find it?”\n\nBy tagging datasets, columns, and metadata with terms from your SPSI vocabulary, you enable: - Keyword search that actually understands synonyms and related terms - Filters based on data type, units, methods, or ecological domain - Smart discovery interfaces (e.g., “Show me everything related to juvenile survival”)\n➡️ Example: A data catalog that lets users search by controlled term rather than inconsistent column names across spreadsheets.\n\n\n\n🔄 2. Semi-Automated Data Integration\n\n“These datasets report the same metric but use different terms, formats, or units.”\n\nUsing controlled terms with defined relationships (e.g., broader, exactMatch, hasUnit), you can: - Detect overlapping fields across submissions automatically - Align columns and units across multiple datasets - Standardize value domains (e.g., Red/Green/Amber vs Critical/Stable/Concerned)\n➡️ Example: A script that reads in new FSAR data and automatically maps it to the SPSR schema for validation and loading into a database.\n\n\n\n🧠 3. Smarter Applications (AI & Beyond)\n\n“Can’t AI just figure this stuff out?”\n\nOnly if you feed it structure.\nControlled vocabularies and ontologies allow you to: - Ground large language models (LLMs) in your domain’s specific terminology - Build Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems for question answering - Use semantic search tools to find relevant variables, concepts, and datasets - Train AI to assist in metadata generation, anomaly detection, or dataset classification\n➡️ Example: A chatbot that helps scientists describe their data using your vocabulary, or recommends matching fields from existing standards.\n\n\n\n🔗 4. Future-Proof Interoperability\n\n“What if we want to share this with other agencies or join a broader platform?”\n\nStandardized vocabularies with persistent URIs and ontology alignments (e.g., with NCEAS, ENVO, OBO) make it easy to: - Share DFO terms with external partners - Convert metadata to international schemas (e.g., Darwin Core, ISO 19115) - Plug into federated data platforms without starting over\n➡️ Example: Publishing your vocabulary to w3id.org lets others reference and reuse your terms as global identifiers.\n\n\n\n🧰 5. Better Metadata, Better Stewardship\n\n“I just want people to fill out metadata that makes sense.”\n\nControlled vocabularies: - Reduce ambiguity - Improve machine readability - Make metadata easier to validate and automate\n➡️ Example: A dropdown menu in a data intake form linked to your vocab that auto-fills units, definitions, and example values — while storing clean, machine-readable metadata under the hood.",
