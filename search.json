    "text": "🤔 Why Bother with Controlled Vocabularies and Ontologies?\nIt’s a fair question. Why invest all this time defining terms, aligning with ontologies, and assigning URIs?\nBecause it unlocks a future where your data works harder for you. Controlled vocabularies and ontologies aren’t just academic exercises — they’re the foundation for better discovery, smarter integration, and automation across the science lifecycle.\nHere are some tangible ways this work adds value:\n\n\n🔍 1. Enhanced Data Discovery\n\n“I know someone collected salmon smolt data… but where do I find it?”\n\nBy tagging datasets, columns, and metadata with terms from your SPSI vocabulary, you enable: - Keyword search that actually understands synonyms and related terms - Filters based on data type, units, methods, or ecological domain - Smart discovery interfaces (e.g., “Show me everything related to juvenile survival”)\n➡️ Example: A data catalog that lets users search by controlled term rather than inconsistent column names across spreadsheets.\n\n\n\n🔄 2. Semi-Automated Data Integration\n\n“These datasets report the same metric but use different terms, formats, or units.”\n\nUsing controlled terms with defined relationships (e.g., broader, exactMatch, hasUnit), you can: - Detect overlapping fields across submissions automatically - Align columns and units across multiple datasets - Standardize value domains (e.g., Red/Green/Amber vs Critical/Stable/Concerned)\n➡️ Example: A script that reads in new FSAR data and automatically maps it to the SPSR schema for validation and loading into a database.\n\n\n\n🧠 3. Smarter Applications (AI & Beyond)\n\n“Can’t AI just figure this stuff out?”\n\nOnly if you feed it structure.\nControlled vocabularies and ontologies allow you to: - Ground large language models (LLMs) in your domain’s specific terminology - Build Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems for question answering - Use semantic search tools to find relevant variables, concepts, and datasets - Train AI to assist in metadata generation, anomaly detection, or dataset classification\n➡️ Example: A chatbot that helps scientists describe their data using your vocabulary, or recommends matching fields from existing standards.\n\n\n\n🔗 4. Future-Proof Interoperability\n\n“What if we want to share this with other agencies or join a broader platform?”\n\nStandardized vocabularies with persistent URIs and ontology alignments (e.g., with NCEAS, ENVO, OBO) make it easy to: - Share DFO terms with external partners - Convert metadata to international schemas (e.g., Darwin Core, ISO 19115) - Plug into federated data platforms without starting over\n➡️ Example: Publishing your vocabulary to w3id.org lets others reference and reuse your terms as global identifiers.\n\n\n\n🧰 5. Better Metadata, Better Stewardship\n\n“I just want people to fill out metadata that makes sense.”\n\nControlled vocabularies: - Reduce ambiguity - Improve machine readability - Make metadata easier to validate and automate\n➡️ Example: A dropdown menu in a data intake form linked to your vocab that auto-fills units, definitions, and example values — while storing clean, machine-readable metadata under the hood.",

    "title": "The Semantic Salmon Data Ecosystem",
    "section": "",
    "text": "1 Overview\nThe Semantic Salmon Data Ecosystem is a coordinated set of standards, ontologies, and tools that make it easier to create, share, and reuse salmon data across organizations. Rather than enforcing one rigid schema, the ecosystem links local datasets to a shared semantic layer so that data remain usable within programs and comparable across programs.\nAt a high level, the ecosystem connects four core components:\n\nDFO Salmon Ontology + controlled vocabularies — a shared semantic backbone.\nSALMON Data Package Specification (SDEP) — a lightweight metadata packaging standard.\nMeta‑SALMON‑R (metasalmon) — validation and tooling that interprets packages.\nSALMON Data GPT (smn‑gpt) — a guided assistant that helps users align datasets.\n\nTogether these components reduce friction for data producers and improve interoperability for analysts, managers, and data stewards.\n\n\n2 1. DFO Salmon Ontology and controlled vocabularies\nThe DFO Salmon Ontology provides formal definitions for salmon concepts, measurement types, demographic units, life stages, and other domain terms. It is paired with controlled vocabularies and thesauri extracted into human‑friendly tables. These vocabularies provide stable identifiers (IRIs) that can be referenced directly in datasets.\nWhy it matters:\n\nPrevents ambiguity across jurisdictions and programs\nAllows consistent interpretation of terms and codes\nCreates a shared language for analytics, integration, and AI workflows\n\nFor formal documentation, see the GC DFO Salmon Ontology page in this hub: GC DFO Salmon Ontology.\nFor controlled vocabularies, see: Controlled Vocabulary & Thesauri.\n\n\n3 2. SALMON Data Package Specification (SDEP)\nThe Salmon Data Exchange Package (SDEP) is a lightweight, frictionless‑style standard that wraps existing data tables with a small set of metadata files. It does not impose a single canonical schema; instead it standardizes metadata about the schema and links those metadata fields to ontology terms.\nEach SDEP package includes:\n\ndataset.csv — dataset‑level metadata\ntables.csv — table inventory and entity definitions\ncolumn_dictionary.csv — column‑level metadata + ontology links\ncodes.csv — optional controlled codes tied to SKOS concepts\n\nWhy it matters:\n\nKeeps adoption lightweight (Excel/CSV friendly)\nCreates machine‑readable metadata without forcing refactors\nEnables validation and automated semantic enrichment\n\nSpec reference: Salmon Data Exchange Package Specification.\n\n\n4 3. Meta‑SALMON‑R (metasalmon)\nThe Meta‑SALMON‑R package provides validation and automation around SDEP packages. It reads metadata files, checks compliance with the specification, and can join in ontology vocabulary information to enrich datasets.\nTypical capabilities include:\n\nValidate package structure and required fields\nDetect missing or inconsistent metadata\nJoin ontology labels and definitions into the metadata tables\nSupport downstream transformations and integration workflows\n\nThis makes the semantic layer actionable, not just descriptive.\n\n\n5 4. SALMON Data GPT (smn‑gpt)\nThe SALMON Data GPT is a guided assistant that helps users build SDEP metadata and align datasets with ontology terms. It is particularly useful for data producers who are new to the standards.\nTypical capabilities include:\n\nDrafting column_dictionary.csv and codes.csv\nSuggesting ontology‑aligned terms and IRIs\nDecomposing compound variables into standardized components\nProposing SDEP‑compliant package layouts\n\nThe GPT acts as a low‑barrier entry point into the ecosystem, while still producing standards‑compliant outputs that can be validated.\n\n\n6 5. How the pieces fit together\nThe ecosystem is designed as a pipeline:\n\nOntology + vocabularies provide authoritative semantics.\nSDEP packages datasets and links columns/codes to ontology terms.\nMeta‑SALMON‑R validates and enriches packages.\nSALMON Data GPT accelerates adoption and helps new users comply.\n\nThis shared pipeline makes it easier for multiple organizations to publish consistent salmon data that remains locally useful but globally interoperable.\n\n\n7 6. Benefits across organizations\n\nFaster integration between jurisdictions and programs\nReduced ambiguity in key salmon concepts\nMore reusable data products for assessments and decision support\nImproved AI readiness by standardizing data semantics\n\n\n\n8 7. Next steps\nThe ecosystem will continue to evolve as standards mature and tools expand. Key near‑term priorities include:\n\nExpanding controlled vocabularies and term tables\nImproving package validation and automation tooling\nTightening feedback loops between data producers and ontology maintainers\nScaling GPT guidance to cover more datasets and workflows\n\n\nThis overview is intended as a 2–3 page introduction for data producers and analysts. It emphasizes adoption and interoperability rather than formal ontology theory.",

    "text": "About the Vocabulary Structure\nUnder the hood, the vocabulary is formatted in SKOS (Simple Knowledge Organization System), a W3C-recommended framework for representing controlled vocabularies and thesauri. By modeling terms and their relationships (broader, narrower, related), SKOS makes it easy to:\n\nMaintain consistent labels, definitions, and concept hierarchies.\nShare and integrate the vocabulary with other systems that understand RDF.\n\nThe vocabulary is intended to be a living document that evolves with the needs of the community. It is maintained by the Data Stewardship Unit (DSU) within the Fisheries and Assessment Data Section (FADS) in the Pacific Region of Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO).\nThe vocabulary is more than a simple glossary: it is a formally structured controlled vocabulary that uses the W3C-endorsed Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS), enabling machine-readable formats for integration into data systems, APIs, and web applications. For a deep-dive on the how and why of controlled vocabularies, see our guide: Support Controlled Vocabularies.",

    "text": "2. Deep Dive into Reference Points and Benchmarks in Stock Assessment\n\nBenchmarks vs Reference Points\n\nWSP Benchmarks (UBM, LBM): Derived from productivity models or empirical data. They are biological in nature and specific to a Conservation Unit (CU).\n\nUBM often corresponds to spawner abundance giving Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) or similar.\nLBM often relates to serious harm thresholds, such as a 50% probability of recovery under management actionHolt et al. 2009 Indica….\n\nPrecautionary Approach Reference Points (USR, LRP): Defined at the Stock Management Unit (SMU) level, which aggregates multiple CUs. The LRP is legally required under the amended Fisheries Act.\n\nThe SMU-level LRP is often derived using the probability that all component CUs are above their respective LBM—commonly at ≥50% probability (Holt et al. 2023)….\nHow a Lower Benchmark Relates to the LRP\nThe CU-level LBM becomes the statistical input for deriving the SMU-level LRP. Specifically:\n\nLRPs can be derived via logistic regression models estimating the probability that all CUs within an SMU exceed their LBMs given a level of aggregate abundance (Holt et al. 2023)\nThis integrates the WSP framework into the Fisheries Act mandate for setting LRPs.\n\nIn essence, LRP ≈ aggregate abundance where there’s ≥50% chance all CUs are above their LBM (Holt et al. 2023)\n\n\nSpawner-Recruitment (SR) Based Approaches\nThe gold standard for benchmark estimation when sufficient data are available.\n\na. Ricker Model\nThe most commonly used model for Pacific salmon: - Equation:\n\\[\nR = S \\cdot e^{(a - bS + \\varepsilon)}\n\\]\n\nWhere…\n\n\\(R\\): Number of recruits (offspring that survive to a specific life stage)\n\\(S\\): Number of spawners (parents that produced the recruits)\n\\(a\\): Log-scale productivity parameter; reflects the average number of recruits per spawner at low population density\n\\(b\\): Density-dependence parameter; determines how rapidly recruitment decreases as spawner abundance increases\n\\(\\varepsilon\\): Process error term accounting for environmental or stochastic variation not explained by the model\n\n\n\nb. Benchmarks Derived From SR Models\n\nLower Benchmark (LRP):\n\nOften set at ( S_{GEN} ): spawner abundance that leads to the LRP (e.g., ( S_{MSY} )) in one generation.\nOr, alternatively, a % of ( S_{MSY} ) (e.g., 40%).\n\nUpper Benchmark (USR):\n\nOften set at 80% of ( S_{MSY} ) or similar.\n\nTarget (TRP):\n\nUsually near ( S_{MSY} ), or the escapement yielding maximum sustainable yield.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternative Methods\n\nc. Percentile-Based Approaches\nUsed when data is limited: - Lower Benchmark: 25th percentile historical abundance. - Upper Benchmark: 50th or 75th percentile historical abundance.\n\n\nd. Risk-Based Approaches\n\nUse Monte Carlo or stochastic simulations to assess risk thresholds by repeatedly sampling from uncertainty distributions.\nSimulations quantify the likelihood of stocks falling below defined critical thresholds (LRP).\nBenchmarks are selected to ensure a low probability (e.g., ≤5%) of breaching critical thresholds under various plausible scenarios.\n\n\n\ne. Closed-Loop Simulations (Management Strategy Evaluation - MSE)\n\nUtilize simulation frameworks to test effectiveness and robustness of different management strategies and Harvest Control Rules (HCRs).\nIncorporate uncertainties explicitly:\n\nObservation errors: uncertainties in monitoring and data collection.\nImplementation variability: differences between planned and actual management actions.\nEnvironmental stochasticity: variability due to environmental factors and climate change.\n\nOutcomes evaluated include biological sustainability, economic viability, and compliance with conservation objectives.",

    "text": "Azure Data Bricks and the Azure Lakehouse\nAzure Databricks is a cloud-based analytics platform for big data processing, machine learning, and collaborative analysis. Built on Apache Spark, it integrates with Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS), Delta Lake, and Synapse Analytics, the core components of the Azure Lakehouse.\nIn this model, Databricks acts as the compute engine, running code while Data Lake Storage and Delta Lake handle scalable, secure data storage. Synapse Analytics adds SQL-based analytics and data warehousing.\nFor DFO, adopting the Lakehouse model eliminates siloed data storage and fragmented code management. Previously, datasets were scattered across systems, and essential data cleaning and analysis code was split across multiple GitHub repositories, making it hard to track, reuse, or standardize. Valuable intermediate data products were often inaccessible. The Lakehouse consolidates data, transformations, and curated datasets, improving collaboration, reproducibility, and transparency.\nNow, analysts can connect directly to the Lakehouse from RStudio (or any IDE) using PATs, gaining seamless, secure access to centralized data with scalable compute. This shift removes past limitations on data access, permissions, and technology use, significantly enhancing DFO’s analytical capabilities.\nThis guide walks through the setup process, enabling you to connect to Azure Databricks and analyze Lakehouse-stored data using RStudio for code execution, GitHub for version control, and the Lakehouse for data storage and sharing.",

Cache intermediate results when performing complex transformations to avoid redundant computations.\nFor example in R:\n\n# Query the data and save it to a variable\ndata &lt;- dbGetQuery(connsql, \"SELECT * FROM ...\") # Run the query only once or as needed for new data\n \n# Perform transformations on the data\ntransformed_data &lt;- data %&gt;% ...\n\n# Cache the transformed data\nsaveRDS(transformed_data, \"transformed_data.rds\")\n\n# Next time you need the transformed data, don't run the query again, instead load it from the cache or from your local copy\n\n# Load the transformed data from the cache\ntransformed_data &lt;- readRDS(\"transformed_data.rds\")\n\n# Continue working with the transformed data",

Databricks will clone the repository and import the code into the notebook.\nCode Execution: When you import code from a GitHub repository into a Databricks notebook, the code is executed in the Databricks environment. This means that any data access or processing tasks will be performed on Databricks compute resources.\nCode Management: While you can import code from a GitHub repository into a Databricks notebook, you are not able to push code changes back to the repository directly from Databricks. If you need to make changes to the code, you will need to do so in the GitHub repository and then re-import the code into the Databricks notebook.",

    "text": "Accessing Open Data via ARCGIS REST\nThe arcpullr package is a great way to access ArcGIS REST services, which are often used for storing spatial data on Open Data. You can use the get_spatial_layer() function to retrieve a spatial layer from an ArcGIS server.\n\nExample: Pacific Recreational Fishery Salmon Head Depots\nThere can many URLs associated with each dataset. The “ArcGIS Rest URL” we need to feed into the get_spatial_layer() function should be the one that includes “arcgis/rest/services”.\nFor example, with the Pacific Recreational Fishery Salmon Head dataset, the URL we are interested in is https://egisp.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/arcgis/rest/services/open_data_donnees_ouvertes/pacific_recreational_fishery_salmon_head_depots/MapServer/.\nIf you have trouble tracking this down, go to the appropriate dataset page on Open Data.\nThen, under the Data and Resources section, find the item labelled ESRI REST (there is both an English and French example). Left click on the Explore dropdown item, then right click on Go to resource, and then left click on Copy link. This then copies the link to the URL you need.\n\n\n\ngoToResource\n\n\nIt is important to ensure the appropriate layer is specified. In this example, the “0” at the end of the address denotes the English version, while a 1 represents French (see layers within the MapServer page). They also do not always correspond to language. For example, in the Pacific Commercial Salmon In Season Catch Estimates dataset, layers 0 to 3 represent gill nets, troll, seine and Pacific Fishery Management Areas, respectively.\n\nsalmonDepots = arcpullr::get_spatial_layer(\"https://egisp.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/arcgis/rest/services/open_data_donnees_ouvertes/pacific_recreational_fishery_salmon_head_depots/MapServer/0\")\n\n\n\nCreating a map\nThere are some great packages to get basemaps in R. The rnaturalearth package is a good option for getting country borders and other geographical features. You can use the ne_countries() function to get country borders.\nIn British Columbia, rnaturalearth may not have the level of detail required (e.g., some islands are missing). The bcmaps package has a lot of detailed basemaps and spatial data for the BC coast, and the bc_bound_hres() function is particularly useful for mapping coastline.\nSince the data used in the tutorial are for the entire BC coast, rnaturalearth is used in the examples below.\n\n# Get coastline for North America \ncoast = ne_countries(scale = 10, returnclass = c(\"sf\"), continent = \"North America\") \n\nBecause the coastline basemap data span all of North America, it may be useful to crop the plot to the bounding box of the data (BC coast). The st_bbox() function from the sf package allows you to get the bounding box of a spatial object. You can use the xlim and ylim arguments in the coord_sf() function to set the limits of the x and y axes.\n\n# Define lat/lon bounds of your dataset\nbounds = st_bbox(salmonDepots)\n\nggplot()+\n  geom_sf(data = coast, fill = \"lightgrey\")+\n  geom_sf(data = salmonDepots, size = 3.5, aes(fill = ACCESSIBILITY___ACCESSIBILITÉ), pch = 21, alpha = 0.85)+\n  coord_sf(xlim = c(bounds[\"xmin\"], bounds[\"xmax\"]),\n    ylim = c(bounds[\"ymin\"], bounds[\"ymax\"]))+\n  # I'm not always convinced maps north arrows need to be added when the lat/lon is specified but some people insist!\n  # Add north arrow to the top right (tr) of the map. It points to \"true\" north, not magnetic north\n  annotation_north_arrow(location = \"tr\", which_north = \"true\",\n                         #height = unit(0.7, \"cm\"), width = unit(0.7, \"cm\"),\n                         style = north_arrow_minimal)+\n  # Also, scale bars shouldn't be added when you're this zoomed out, but here's how to add one anyway to the bottom left (bl):\n  annotation_scale(location = \"bl\", text_cex = 0.8)+\n  scale_fill_discrete(name = \"Accessibility\")+\n  theme_bw() # tidies up the visuals",

However, the Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) associated with each dataset remains unchanged.\nIn the Open Data portal, the UUID is the final part of the URL after “dataset”. For example, in the Pacific Recreational Salmon Head Depots dataset (https://open.canada.ca/data/dataset/3cc03bbf-d59f-4812-996e-ddc52e0ba99e), the UUID is 3cc03bbf-d59f-4812-996e-ddc52e0ba99e.\nTo make our script more robust, we can use the CKAN API. CKAN is a data management system that supports publishing, sharing, and discovering datasets. The ckanr package in R allows us to interact with CKAN-based portals, such as Open Data. You can use the ckanr_setup() function to establish a connection.\nInstead of hardcoding the ArcGIS REST URL in our script (which may change) we can use the CKAN API to reference the stable UUID. This allows us to dynamically retrieve the current ArcGIS REST URL associated with that UUID, ensuring our code remains functional even if updates occur.\n\nDownloading data\nWe’ll use the Pacific Recreational Fishery Salmon Head Depots data as an example. We can use the ckanr package to extract the ArcGIS REST URL by referencing the UUID. This may seem like an extra step while you’re writing your code, but it will save you time in the long run if the URLs change (it can happen!!)\n\nckanr::ckanr_setup(\"https://open.canada.ca/data\")\nuuid = \"3cc03bbf-d59f-4812-996e-ddc52e0ba99e\"\npkg = ckanr::package_show(uuid)\nresources = pkg$resources\ndf_resources = as.data.frame(do.call(rbind, resources))\n\n# Now you can grab the correct ESRI Rest URL (\"url\").

    "section": "",
    "text": "1 Overview\nThe Salmon Data Exchange Package (SDEP) is a lightweight, frictionless-style specification for exchanging salmon datasets between scientists, assessment biologists, and data stewards.\nIt is designed to:\n\nBe simple to adopt with Excel and CSV files.\nBe tool-friendly for R/Python packages and custom GPT assistants.\nBe ontology-aware, linking columns and codes to the DFO Salmon Ontology and related vocabularies.\nBe compatible with frictionless data packages and Darwin Core–style semantic layers without forcing a single rigid schema.\n\nEach SDEP instance is a small directory of CSV data files plus a set of metadata CSVs that describe the dataset, tables, columns, and controlled codes.\n\n\n2 Design Goals\n\nInteroperable but flexible: support multiple schemas (FSAR, SPSR-like, project-specific) while providing shared semantics via URIs.\nFRICTIONLESS-compatible: align conceptually with frictionless/datapackage ideas so existing tooling can be reused or extended.\nOntology-linked: allow columns and codes to reference DFO Salmon Ontology and SKOS vocab IRIs.\nIncremental adoption: existing tables can be wrapped in a package with minimal changes (no need to refactor everything at once).\nMachine- and human-readable: scientists can work in spreadsheets; machines can consume the same metadata.\n\n\n\n3 Package Layout\nA Salmon Data Exchange Package consists of:\n\nOne root directory (e.g., SDEP_myproject/) containing:\n\ndataset.csv – dataset-level metadata.\ntables.csv – one row per logical table.\ncolumn_dictionary.csv – one row per column in each table.\ncodes.csv – optional: controlled value lists and SKOS links.\n\nOne or more data files (typically CSV) referenced from tables.csv, usually in a data/ subdirectory.\n\nMinimal example layout:\n\ndataset.csv\ntables.csv\ncolumn_dictionary.csv\ncodes.csv (optional for fully numeric or unconstrained columns)\ndata/your_table_1.csv\ndata/your_table_2.csv\netc.\n\nDownloadable starter assets:\n\nMinimal SDEP example package (zip)\nBrowse example package files\n\nThe SDEP spec does not prescribe a single canonical salmon schema. Instead, it standardizes the metadata about whatever schema a project uses and ties it to ontology and vocabularies.\n\n\n4 Identifiers and Conventions\n\ndataset_id\n\nShort string identifier unique within your organization or project (e.g., fsar_spsr_chinook_2025).\nUsed to link rows across dataset.csv, tables.csv, column_dictionary.csv, and codes.csv.\n\ntable_id\n\nShort ID unique within a dataset (e.g., cu_year_index, survey_events).\n\ncolumn_name\n\nExact column name as it appears in the data file (e.g., TOTAL_SPAWNERS, run_size_total).\n\nURIs / IRIs\n\nFields such as dataset_iri, entity_iri, term_iri, concept_scheme_iri, unit_iri should use persistent HTTP IRIs where available (e.g., w3id for DFO Salmon Ontology terms, vocabulary concepts, and units).\n\n\n\n\n5 dataset.csv Schema\nOne row per logical dataset (often one per SDEP directory).

    "text": "Sir Isaac Newton said, “If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.” As scientists, we aim to share our findings with colleagues who may use the information to continue to make progress on important questions. Making your data more transparent and reproducible not only contributes to a more useful body of work but provides “shoulders” for those who come after you (other colleagues, students, and collaborators). It’s also handy for improving your own workflow. Your personal peace of mind is another added bonus to front loading the work of organizing and describing your dataset.\nYou might be wondering what are we referring to when we talk about “Open Science”. A more open approach to research means making results accessible for the benefits of both scientists and broader society (UNESCO 2023). The Open Science movement aims to increase transparency and the speed of knowledge transfer. Barriers to Open Science include things like: paywalled journals, favouring knowledge produced by high-income countries, hidden or unknown source code or workflow, and supporting data that is unavailable or unusable. In this article, we’ll tackle the last barrier and talk about practical ways to make your data more Open.",

    "text": "2. Redundancy in data is OK sometimes!\nThroughout our scientific careers, we’re often told to be concise and simplify so this advice may surprise you. Strategic redundancy in data allows you to make linkages between different pieces of information. It also saves space. One way to invoke the hidden power of redundancy is using metadata and data dictionaries to link important context to your primary dataset. For example, this table contains two types of observations: song information and Billboard rankings with one entry (i.e., row) each week the song remains on the Billboard Hot 100. Look what happens when we split the information into two tables: one with the song titles, artists’ names and run times; and the other with details on their Billboard rankings. This:\n\nAvoids confusion at scale – note how there are two types of temporal data in the first table. One could conflate time and date.\nSaves space. Say there were 100 songs with an average of 7 entries each. Rather than a table with 700 entries and 7 variables (4900 pieces of data), you now have 2 tables (containing 4500 data points total). This difference in memory usage scales with the size of your dataset.\n\n Table 1. Too much information at different scales crammed into a single table. Table adapted from Wickham (2014).\n Table 2: Example of using redundancy by splitting tables in two. Note how one song (left) has multiple Billboard rankings (right). Tables adapted from Wickham (2014).",

    "section": "3. Keep raw data raw",
    "text": "3. Keep raw data raw\nSeparating your raw data from analyses is essential for reproducibility. After all, how can we reproduce an analysis if we have no access to the original dataset? In repositories, create a folder named RAW. Place unmanipulated data here. Do not open these files except to add or remove raw data. You may consider setting them to “read-only” when viewing in Excel. Keep all analyses in your scripts and outside of Excel, which will read the data and create outputs from it. Use a descriptive file name for any outputs generated from raw data and place them in a separate folder.\nEmbracing Open Science practices doesn’t have to be overwhelming. By adopting tidy data formats, allowing for strategic redundancy, and keeping raw data untouched, you can contribute to a more transparent and collaborative scientific community and yourself up for smoother workflows and more reproducible research. These small, intentional steps can have a big impact, helping others build on your work and accelerating the pace of discovery.",

It provides tools for following the ethos of tidy data, which holds the following tenets:\n\nEach variable is a column; each column is a variable.\nEach observation is a row; each row is an observation.\nEach value is a cell; each cell is a single value.\n\nFor example, make your wide formatted data more tidy with pivot_longer() or deal with missing values with drop_na().\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipWant to load all the tidyverse packages at once?\n\n\n\nTry library(tidyverse) to load all of those amazing tools in one line\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot2 is a powerful tool for data visualization offered under the tidyverse umbrella.\nAs any scientist knows, visualizing your data is just as important as generating it. After all, how can you communicate your results if they’re hidden away in a table?\nThe R graph gallery has countless of great examples of plots created with ggplot2. Check them out!\n\n\n\nAnother tidyverse offering, dplyr is an essential package for data manipulation. Try out generating summary stats in a breeze with group_by() |&gt; summarise() or join two datasets with a left_join().\n\n\n\narrow is an amazing tool for working with larger than memory data. R usually performs computations in RAM (your computer’s short term memory), but this can pose a problem for larger datasets. Arrow moves computations onto disk (your computer’s long term memory) to avoid this.\nFor a tutorial, see here",
