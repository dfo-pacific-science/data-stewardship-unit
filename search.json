    "text": "Azure Data Bricks and the Azure Lakehouse\nAzure Databricks is a cloud-based analytics platform for big data processing, machine learning, and collaborative analysis. Built on Apache Spark, it integrates with Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS), Delta Lake, and Synapse Analytics, the core components of the Azure Lakehouse.\nIn this model, Databricks acts as the compute engine, running code while Data Lake Storage and Delta Lake handle scalable, secure data storage. Synapse Analytics adds SQL-based analytics and data warehousing.\nFor DFO, adopting the Lakehouse model eliminates siloed data storage and fragmented code management. Previously, datasets were scattered across systems, and essential data cleaning and analysis code was split across multiple GitHub repositories, making it hard to track, reuse, or standardize. Valuable intermediate data products were often inaccessible. The Lakehouse consolidates data, transformations, and curated datasets, improving collaboration, reproducibility, and transparency.\nNow, analysts can connect directly to the Lakehouse from RStudio (or any IDE) using PATs, gaining seamless, secure access to centralized data with scalable compute. This shift removes past limitations on data access, permissions, and technology use, significantly enhancing DFO’s analytical capabilities.\nThis guide walks through the setup process, enabling you to connect to Azure Databricks and analyze Lakehouse-stored data using RStudio for code execution, GitHub for version control, and the Lakehouse for data storage and sharing.",

Cache intermediate results when performing complex transformations to avoid redundant computations.\nFor example in R:\n# Query the data and save it to a variable\ndata &lt;- dbGetQuery(connsql, \"SELECT * FROM ...\") # Run the query only once or as needed for new data\n \n# Perform transformations on the data\ntransformed_data &lt;- data %&gt;% ...\n\n# Cache the transformed data\nsaveRDS(transformed_data, \"transformed_data.rds\")\n\n# Next time you need the transformed data, don't run the query again, instead load it from the cache or from your local copy\n\n# Load the transformed data from the cache\ntransformed_data &lt;- readRDS(\"transformed_data.rds\")\n\n# Continue working with the transformed data",

This allows you to leverage the version control and collaboration features of GitHub while working in Databricks.\nHowever, there are a few things to keep in mind when using a GitHub repo in Databricks:\n\nImporting Code: You can import code from a GitHub repository into a Databricks notebook by specifying the URL of the GitHub repository. Databricks will clone the repository and import the code into the notebook.\nCode Execution: When you import code from a GitHub repository into a Databricks notebook, the code is executed in the Databricks environment. This means that any data access or processing tasks will be performed on Databricks compute resources.\nCode Management: While you can import code from a GitHub repository into a Databricks notebook, you are not able to push code changes back to the repository directly from Databricks. If you need to make changes to the code, you will need to do so in the GitHub repository and then re-import the code into the Databricks notebook.",

Darwin Core provides a common data standard that enables these internal formats to be mapped to:\n\nOther DFO systems\nNational open data platforms\nInternational biodiversity repositories (e.g., GBIF, OBIS)\n\nBy treating Darwin Core as a semantic translation layer, we can harmonize our internal datasets for interoperability, discoverability, and reuse, without requiring all groups to adopt the same database design.\n\n\n\n\nThe GBIF Unified Data Model extends Darwin Core to support complex biodiversity datasets, including:\n\nEvents (e.g., sampling campaigns, cruises, transects)\nOccurrences (e.g., individual specimens, observations)\nMeasurements or Facts (e.g., biological measurements, environmental conditions)\n\nThis model aligns with DFO data practices that involve nested relationships between surveys, gear deployments, catches, and individual biological samples.\n\n\n\n\nOBIS builds on Darwin Core and the GBIF model to support marine biodiversity data.

    "text": "🤔 Why Bother with Controlled Vocabularies and Ontologies?\nIt’s a fair question. Why invest all this time defining terms, aligning with ontologies, and assigning URIs?\nBecause it unlocks a future where your data works harder for you. Controlled vocabularies and ontologies aren’t just academic exercises — they’re the foundation for better discovery, smarter integration, and automation across the science lifecycle.\nHere are some tangible ways this work adds value:\n\n\n🔍 1. Enhanced Data Discovery\n\n“I know someone collected salmon smolt data… but where do I find it?”\n\nBy tagging datasets, columns, and metadata with terms from your SPSI vocabulary, you enable: - Keyword search that actually understands synonyms and related terms - Filters based on data type, units, methods, or ecological domain - Smart discovery interfaces (e.g., “Show me everything related to juvenile survival”)\n➡️ Example: A data catalog that lets users search by controlled term rather than inconsistent column names across spreadsheets.\n\n\n\n🔄 2. Semi-Automated Data Integration\n\n“These datasets report the same metric but use different terms, formats, or units.”\n\nUsing controlled terms with defined relationships (e.g., broader, exactMatch, hasUnit), you can: - Detect overlapping fields across submissions automatically - Align columns and units across multiple datasets - Standardize value domains (e.g., Red/Green/Amber vs Critical/Stable/Concerned)\n➡️ Example: A script that reads in new FSAR data and automatically maps it to the SPSR schema for validation and loading into a database.\n\n\n\n🧠 3. Smarter Applications (AI & Beyond)\n\n“Can’t AI just figure this stuff out?”\n\nOnly if you feed it structure.\nControlled vocabularies and ontologies allow you to: - Ground large language models (LLMs) in your domain’s specific terminology - Build Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems for question answering - Use semantic search tools to find relevant variables, concepts, and datasets - Train AI to assist in metadata generation, anomaly detection, or dataset classification\n➡️ Example: A chatbot that helps scientists describe their data using your vocabulary, or recommends matching fields from existing standards.\n\n\n\n🔗 4. Future-Proof Interoperability\n\n“What if we want to share this with other agencies or join a broader platform?”\n\nStandardized vocabularies with persistent URIs and ontology alignments (e.g., with NCEAS, ENVO, OBO) make it easy to: - Share DFO terms with external partners - Convert metadata to international schemas (e.g., Darwin Core, ISO 19115) - Plug into federated data platforms without starting over\n➡️ Example: Publishing your vocabulary to w3id.org lets others reference and reuse your terms as global identifiers.\n\n\n\n🧰 5. Better Metadata, Better Stewardship\n\n“I just want people to fill out metadata that makes sense.”\n\nControlled vocabularies: - Reduce ambiguity - Improve machine readability - Make metadata easier to validate and automate\n➡️ Example: A dropdown menu in a data intake form linked to your vocab that auto-fills units, definitions, and example values — while storing clean, machine-readable metadata under the hood.",
