    "text": "2. Deep Dive into Reference Points and Benchmarks in Stock Assessment\n\nBenchmarks vs Reference Points\n\nWSP Benchmarks (UBM, LBM): Derived from productivity models or empirical data. They are biological in nature and specific to a Conservation Unit (CU).\n\nUBM often corresponds to spawner abundance giving Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) or similar.\nLBM often relates to serious harm thresholds, such as a 50% probability of recovery under management actionHolt et al. 2009 Indica….\n\nPrecautionary Approach Reference Points (USR, LRP): Defined at the Stock Management Unit (SMU) level, which aggregates multiple CUs. The LRP is legally required under the amended Fisheries Act.\n\nThe SMU-level LRP is often derived using the probability that all component CUs are above their respective LBM—commonly at ≥50% probability (Holt et al. 2023)….\nHow a Lower Benchmark Relates to the LRP\nThe CU-level LBM becomes the statistical input for deriving the SMU-level LRP. Specifically:\n\nLRPs can be derived via logistic regression models estimating the probability that all CUs within an SMU exceed their LBMs given a level of aggregate abundance (Holt et al. 2023)\nThis integrates the WSP framework into the Fisheries Act mandate for setting LRPs.\n\nIn essence, LRP ≈ aggregate abundance where there’s ≥50% chance all CUs are above their LBM (Holt et al. 2023)\n\n\nSpawner-Recruitment (SR) Based Approaches\nThe gold standard for benchmark estimation when sufficient data are available.\n\na. Ricker Model\nThe most commonly used model for Pacific salmon: - Equation:\n\\[\nR = S \\cdot e^{(a - bS + \\varepsilon)}\n\\]\n\nWhere…\n\n\\(R\\): Number of recruits (offspring that survive to a specific life stage)\n\\(S\\): Number of spawners (parents that produced the recruits)\n\\(a\\): Log-scale productivity parameter; reflects the average number of recruits per spawner at low population density\n\\(b\\): Density-dependence parameter; determines how rapidly recruitment decreases as spawner abundance increases\n\\(\\varepsilon\\): Process error term accounting for environmental or stochastic variation not explained by the model\n\n\n\nb. Benchmarks Derived From SR Models\n\nLower Benchmark (LRP):\n\nOften set at ( S_{GEN} ): spawner abundance that leads to the LRP (e.g., ( S_{MSY} )) in one generation.\nOr, alternatively, a % of ( S_{MSY} ) (e.g., 40%).\n\nUpper Benchmark (USR):\n\nOften set at 80% of ( S_{MSY} ) or similar.\n\nTarget (TRP):\n\nUsually near ( S_{MSY} ), or the escapement yielding maximum sustainable yield.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternative Methods\n\nc. Percentile-Based Approaches\nUsed when data is limited: - Lower Benchmark: 25th percentile historical abundance. - Upper Benchmark: 50th or 75th percentile historical abundance.\n\n\nd. Risk-Based Approaches\n\nUse Monte Carlo or stochastic simulations to assess risk thresholds by repeatedly sampling from uncertainty distributions.\nSimulations quantify the likelihood of stocks falling below defined critical thresholds (LRP).\nBenchmarks are selected to ensure a low probability (e.g., ≤5%) of breaching critical thresholds under various plausible scenarios.\n\n\n\ne. Closed-Loop Simulations (Management Strategy Evaluation - MSE)\n\nUtilize simulation frameworks to test effectiveness and robustness of different management strategies and Harvest Control Rules (HCRs).\nIncorporate uncertainties explicitly:\n\nObservation errors: uncertainties in monitoring and data collection.\nImplementation variability: differences between planned and actual management actions.\nEnvironmental stochasticity: variability due to environmental factors and climate change.\n\nOutcomes evaluated include biological sustainability, economic viability, and compliance with conservation objectives.",

    "text": "🤔 Why Bother with Controlled Vocabularies and Ontologies?\nIt’s a fair question. Why invest all this time defining terms, aligning with ontologies, and assigning URIs?\nBecause it unlocks a future where your data works harder for you. Controlled vocabularies and ontologies aren’t just academic exercises — they’re the foundation for better discovery, smarter integration, and automation across the science lifecycle.\nHere are some tangible ways this work adds value:\n\n\n🔍 1. Enhanced Data Discovery\n\n“I know someone collected salmon smolt data… but where do I find it?”\n\nBy tagging datasets, columns, and metadata with terms from your SPSI vocabulary, you enable: - Keyword search that actually understands synonyms and related terms - Filters based on data type, units, methods, or ecological domain - Smart discovery interfaces (e.g., “Show me everything related to juvenile survival”)\n➡️ Example: A data catalog that lets users search by controlled term rather than inconsistent column names across spreadsheets.\n\n\n\n🔄 2. Semi-Automated Data Integration\n\n“These datasets report the same metric but use different terms, formats, or units.”\n\nUsing controlled terms with defined relationships (e.g., broader, exactMatch, hasUnit), you can: - Detect overlapping fields across submissions automatically - Align columns and units across multiple datasets - Standardize value domains (e.g., Red/Green/Amber vs Critical/Stable/Concerned)\n➡️ Example: A script that reads in new FSAR data and automatically maps it to the SPSR schema for validation and loading into a database.\n\n\n\n🧠 3. Smarter Applications (AI & Beyond)\n\n“Can’t AI just figure this stuff out?”\n\nOnly if you feed it structure.\nControlled vocabularies and ontologies allow you to: - Ground large language models (LLMs) in your domain’s specific terminology - Build Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems for question answering - Use semantic search tools to find relevant variables, concepts, and datasets - Train AI to assist in metadata generation, anomaly detection, or dataset classification\n➡️ Example: A chatbot that helps scientists describe their data using your vocabulary, or recommends matching fields from existing standards.\n\n\n\n🔗 4. Future-Proof Interoperability\n\n“What if we want to share this with other agencies or join a broader platform?”\n\nStandardized vocabularies with persistent URIs and ontology alignments (e.g., with NCEAS, ENVO, OBO) make it easy to: - Share DFO terms with external partners - Convert metadata to international schemas (e.g., Darwin Core, ISO 19115) - Plug into federated data platforms without starting over\n➡️ Example: Publishing your vocabulary to w3id.org lets others reference and reuse your terms as global identifiers.\n\n\n\n🧰 5. Better Metadata, Better Stewardship\n\n“I just want people to fill out metadata that makes sense.”\n\nControlled vocabularies: - Reduce ambiguity - Improve machine readability - Make metadata easier to validate and automate\n➡️ Example: A dropdown menu in a data intake form linked to your vocab that auto-fills units, definitions, and example values — while storing clean, machine-readable metadata under the hood.",

Built on Apache Spark, it integrates with Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS), Delta Lake, and Synapse Analytics, the core components of the Azure Lakehouse.\nIn this model, Databricks acts as the compute engine, running code while Data Lake Storage and Delta Lake handle scalable, secure data storage. Synapse Analytics adds SQL-based analytics and data warehousing.\nFor DFO, adopting the Lakehouse model eliminates siloed data storage and fragmented code management. Previously, datasets were scattered across systems, and essential data cleaning and analysis code was split across multiple GitHub repositories, making it hard to track, reuse, or standardize. Valuable intermediate data products were often inaccessible. The Lakehouse consolidates data, transformations, and curated datasets, improving collaboration, reproducibility, and transparency.\nNow, analysts can connect directly to the Lakehouse from RStudio (or any IDE) using PATs, gaining seamless, secure access to centralized data with scalable compute. This shift removes past limitations on data access, permissions, and technology use, significantly enhancing DFO’s analytical capabilities.\nThis guide walks through the setup process, enabling you to connect to Azure Databricks and analyze Lakehouse-stored data using RStudio for code execution, GitHub for version control, and the Lakehouse for data storage and sharing.",

It provides tools for following the ethos of tidy data, which holds the following tenets:\n\nEach variable is a column; each column is a variable.\nEach observation is a row; each row is an observation.\nEach value is a cell; each cell is a single value.\n\nFor example, make your wide formatted data more tidy with pivot_longer() or deal with missing values with drop_na().\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWant to load all the tidyverse packages at once?\n\n\n\nTry library(tidyverse) to load all of those amazing tools in one line\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot2 is a powerful tool for data visualization offered under the tidyverse umbrella.\nAs any scientist knows, visualizing your data is just as important as generating it. After all, how can you communicate your results if they’re hidden away in a table?\nThe R graph gallery has countless of great examples of plots created with ggplot2. Check them out!\n\n\n\nAnother tidyverse offering, dplyr is an essential package for data manipulation. Try out generating summary stats in a breeze with group_by() |&gt; summarise() or join two datasets with a left_join().\n\n\n\narrow is an amazing tool for working with larger than memory data. R usually performs computations in RAM (your computer’s short term memory), but this can pose a problem for larger datasets.

Our primary focus is on data related to Pacific Salmon within the DFO Pacific Region, including biodata (e.g., fish weight, length, age, escapement statistics, genomic data), juvenile salmon, and associated ecological and environmental data.\nOur goal is to provide guidance and assistance throughout the entire lifecycle of data management—from planning to publication. We strive to ensure our practices align with modern data standards, such as those outlined in the DFO Data Strategy and the Government of Canada’s digital data strategy. For instance, our work is guided by the principles of making data findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR). Additionally, we highly value the principles of Indigenous data governance, such as ownership, control, access, and possession (OCAP), and we are committed to helping our collaborators respect and implement these principles in their work."
