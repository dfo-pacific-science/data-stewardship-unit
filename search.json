For canonical field definitions and version history, use the GitHub source above.\n\n1 Overview\nThe salmon data package (SDP) is a lightweight, frictionless-style specification for exchanging salmon datasets between scientists, assessment biologists, and data stewards.\nIt is designed to:\n\nBe simple to adopt with Excel and CSV files.\nBe tool-friendly for R/Python packages and custom GPT assistants.\nBe ontology-aware, linking columns and codes to the DFO Salmon Ontology and related vocabularies.\nBe compatible with frictionless data packages and Darwin Core–style semantic layers without forcing a single rigid schema.\n\nEach salmon data package instance is a small directory of CSV data files plus a set of metadata CSVs that describe the dataset, tables, columns, and controlled codes.\n\n\n2 Design Goals\n\nInteroperable but flexible: support multiple schemas (FSAR, SPSR-like, project-specific) while providing shared semantics via URIs.\nFRICTIONLESS-compatible: align conceptually with frictionless/datapackage ideas so existing tooling can be reused or extended.\nOntology-linked: allow columns and codes to reference DFO Salmon Ontology and SKOS vocab IRIs.\nIncremental adoption: existing tables can be wrapped in a package with minimal changes (no need to refactor everything at once).\nMachine- and human-readable: scientists can work in spreadsheets; machines can consume the same metadata.\n\n\n\n3 Package Layout\nA salmon data package consists of:\n\nOne root directory (e.g., sdp_myproject/) containing:\n\ndataset.csv – dataset-level metadata.\ntables.csv – one row per logical table.\ncolumn_dictionary.csv – one row per column in each table.\ncodes.csv – optional: controlled value lists and SKOS links.\n\nOne or more data files (typically CSV) referenced from tables.csv, usually in a data/ subdirectory.\n\nMinimal example layout:\n\ndataset.csv\ntables.csv\ncolumn_dictionary.csv\ncodes.csv (optional for fully numeric or unconstrained columns)\ndata/your_table_1.csv\ndata/your_table_2.csv\netc.\n\nDownloadable starter assets:\n\nMinimal salmon data package example (zip)\nBrowse example package files\n\nThe salmon data package specification does not prescribe a single canonical salmon schema.

    "text": "Azure Data Bricks and the Azure Lakehouse\nAzure Databricks is a cloud-based analytics platform for big data processing, machine learning, and collaborative analysis. Built on Apache Spark, it integrates with Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS), Delta Lake, and Synapse Analytics, the core components of the Azure Lakehouse.\nIn this model, Databricks acts as the compute engine, running code while Data Lake Storage and Delta Lake handle scalable, secure data storage. Synapse Analytics adds SQL-based analytics and data warehousing.\nFor DFO, adopting the Lakehouse model eliminates siloed data storage and fragmented code management. Previously, datasets were scattered across systems, and essential data cleaning and analysis code was split across multiple GitHub repositories, making it hard to track, reuse, or standardize. Valuable intermediate data products were often inaccessible. The Lakehouse consolidates data, transformations, and curated datasets, improving collaboration, reproducibility, and transparency.\nNow, analysts can connect directly to the Lakehouse from RStudio (or any IDE) using PATs, gaining seamless, secure access to centralized data with scalable compute. This shift removes past limitations on data access, permissions, and technology use, significantly enhancing DFO’s analytical capabilities.\nThis guide walks through the setup process, enabling you to connect to Azure Databricks and analyze Lakehouse-stored data using RStudio for code execution, GitHub for version control, and the Lakehouse for data storage and sharing.",

Several inconsistencies, such as those seen in Stikine, highlight the need for an integrated data architecture and harmonized terminology.\nTable 1.

    "text": "2. Deep Dive into Reference Points and Benchmarks in Stock Assessment\n\nBenchmarks vs Reference Points\n\nWSP Benchmarks (UBM, LBM): Derived from productivity models or empirical data. They are biological in nature and specific to a Conservation Unit (CU).\n\nUBM often corresponds to spawner abundance giving Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) or similar.\nLBM often relates to serious harm thresholds, such as a 50% probability of recovery under management actionHolt et al. 2009 Indica….\n\nPrecautionary Approach Reference Points (USR, LRP): Defined at the Stock Management Unit (SMU) level, which aggregates multiple CUs. The LRP is legally required under the amended Fisheries Act.\n\nThe SMU-level LRP is often derived using the probability that all component CUs are above their respective LBM—commonly at ≥50% probability (Holt et al. 2023)….\nHow a Lower Benchmark Relates to the LRP\nThe CU-level LBM becomes the statistical input for deriving the SMU-level LRP. Specifically:\n\nLRPs can be derived via logistic regression models estimating the probability that all CUs within an SMU exceed their LBMs given a level of aggregate abundance (Holt et al. 2023)\nThis integrates the WSP framework into the Fisheries Act mandate for setting LRPs.\n\nIn essence, LRP ≈ aggregate abundance where there’s ≥50% chance all CUs are above their LBM (Holt et al. 2023)\n\n\nSpawner-Recruitment (SR) Based Approaches\nThe gold standard for benchmark estimation when sufficient data are available.\n\na. Ricker Model\nThe most commonly used model for Pacific salmon: - Equation:\n\\[\nR = S \\cdot e^{(a - bS + \\varepsilon)}\n\\]\n\nWhere…\n\n\\(R\\): Number of recruits (offspring that survive to a specific life stage)\n\\(S\\): Number of spawners (parents that produced the recruits)\n\\(a\\): Log-scale productivity parameter; reflects the average number of recruits per spawner at low population density\n\\(b\\): Density-dependence parameter; determines how rapidly recruitment decreases as spawner abundance increases\n\\(\\varepsilon\\): Process error term accounting for environmental or stochastic variation not explained by the model\n\n\n\nb. Benchmarks Derived From SR Models\n\nLower Benchmark (LRP):\n\nOften set at ( S_{GEN} ): spawner abundance that leads to the LRP (e.g., ( S_{MSY} )) in one generation.\nOr, alternatively, a % of ( S_{MSY} ) (e.g., 40%).\n\nUpper Benchmark (USR):\n\nOften set at 80% of ( S_{MSY} ) or similar.\n\nTarget (TRP):\n\nUsually near ( S_{MSY} ), or the escapement yielding maximum sustainable yield.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternative Methods\n\nc. Percentile-Based Approaches\nUsed when data is limited: - Lower Benchmark: 25th percentile historical abundance. - Upper Benchmark: 50th or 75th percentile historical abundance.\n\n\nd. Risk-Based Approaches\n\nUse Monte Carlo or stochastic simulations to assess risk thresholds by repeatedly sampling from uncertainty distributions.\nSimulations quantify the likelihood of stocks falling below defined critical thresholds (LRP).\nBenchmarks are selected to ensure a low probability (e.g., ≤5%) of breaching critical thresholds under various plausible scenarios.\n\n\n\ne. Closed-Loop Simulations (Management Strategy Evaluation - MSE)\n\nUtilize simulation frameworks to test effectiveness and robustness of different management strategies and Harvest Control Rules (HCRs).\nIncorporate uncertainties explicitly:\n\nObservation errors: uncertainties in monitoring and data collection.\nImplementation variability: differences between planned and actual management actions.\nEnvironmental stochasticity: variability due to environmental factors and climate change.\n\nOutcomes evaluated include biological sustainability, economic viability, and compliance with conservation objectives.",

    "section": "Accessing Open Data via ARCGIS REST",
    "text": "Accessing Open Data via ARCGIS REST\nThe arcpullr package is a great way to access ArcGIS REST services, which are often used for storing spatial data on Open Data. You can use the get_spatial_layer() function to retrieve a spatial layer from an ArcGIS server.\n\nExample: Pacific Recreational Fishery Salmon Head Depots\nThere can many URLs associated with each dataset. The “ArcGIS Rest URL” we need to feed into the get_spatial_layer() function should be the one that includes “arcgis/rest/services”.\nFor example, with the Pacific Recreational Fishery Salmon Head dataset, the URL we are interested in is https://egisp.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/arcgis/rest/services/open_data_donnees_ouvertes/pacific_recreational_fishery_salmon_head_depots/MapServer/.\nIf you have trouble tracking this down, go to the appropriate dataset page on Open Data.\nThen, under the Data and Resources section, find the item labelled ESRI REST (there is both an English and French example). Left click on the Explore dropdown item, then right click on Go to resource, and then left click on Copy link. This then copies the link to the URL you need.\n\n\n\ngoToResource\n\n\nIt is important to ensure the appropriate layer is specified. In this example, the “0” at the end of the address denotes the English version, while a 1 represents French (see layers within the MapServer page). They also do not always correspond to language. For example, in the Pacific Commercial Salmon In Season Catch Estimates dataset, layers 0 to 3 represent gill nets, troll, seine and Pacific Fishery Management Areas, respectively.\n\nsalmonDepots = arcpullr::get_spatial_layer(\"https://egisp.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/arcgis/rest/services/open_data_donnees_ouvertes/pacific_recreational_fishery_salmon_head_depots/MapServer/0\")\n\n\n\nCreating a map\nThere are some great packages to get basemaps in R. The rnaturalearth package is a good option for getting country borders and other geographical features. You can use the ne_countries() function to get country borders.\nIn British Columbia, rnaturalearth may not have the level of detail required (e.g., some islands are missing). The bcmaps package has a lot of detailed basemaps and spatial data for the BC coast, and the bc_bound_hres() function is particularly useful for mapping coastline.\nSince the data used in the tutorial are for the entire BC coast, rnaturalearth is used in the examples below.\n\n# Get coastline for North America \ncoast = ne_countries(scale = 10, returnclass = c(\"sf\"), continent = \"North America\") \n\nBecause the coastline basemap data span all of North America, it may be useful to crop the plot to the bounding box of the data (BC coast). The st_bbox() function from the sf package allows you to get the bounding box of a spatial object. You can use the xlim and ylim arguments in the coord_sf() function to set the limits of the x and y axes.",

    "text": "Using ckanr to build more robust code\nSometimes, IT needs to upgrade server hardware or software, which can result in changes to the ArcGIS REST service URLs (i.e., the portion like this: https://egisp.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/arcgis/rest/services). However, the Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) associated with each dataset remains unchanged.\nIn the Open Data portal, the UUID is the final part of the URL after “dataset”. For example, in the Pacific Recreational Salmon Head Depots dataset (https://open.canada.ca/data/dataset/3cc03bbf-d59f-4812-996e-ddc52e0ba99e), the UUID is 3cc03bbf-d59f-4812-996e-ddc52e0ba99e.\nTo make our script more robust, we can use the CKAN API. CKAN is a data management system that supports publishing, sharing, and discovering datasets. The ckanr package in R allows us to interact with CKAN-based portals, such as Open Data. You can use the ckanr_setup() function to establish a connection.\nInstead of hardcoding the ArcGIS REST URL in our script (which may change) we can use the CKAN API to reference the stable UUID. This allows us to dynamically retrieve the current ArcGIS REST URL associated with that UUID, ensuring our code remains functional even if updates occur.\n\nDownloading data\nWe’ll use the Pacific Recreational Fishery Salmon Head Depots data as an example. We can use the ckanr package to extract the ArcGIS REST URL by referencing the UUID. This may seem like an extra step while you’re writing your code, but it will save you time in the long run if the URLs change (it can happen!!)\n\nckanr::ckanr_setup(\"https://open.canada.ca/data\")\nuuid = \"3cc03bbf-d59f-4812-996e-ddc52e0ba99e\"\npkg = ckanr::package_show(uuid)\nresources = pkg$resources\ndf_resources = as.data.frame(do.call(rbind, resources))\n\n# Now you can grab the correct ESRI Rest URL (\"url\"). Make sure to search for that format, and also specify you want the English (\"En\") version and not French\nsalmon_url = unlist(df_resources[df_resources$format == \"ESRI REST\" & sapply(df_resources$language, function(x) \"en\" %in% x), \"url\"])\n\n\n\nSearching for data\nYou can also use the ckanr package to search for data using the package_search() function. You can use the q argument to search for key words, and the fq argument to specify file types.\n\nckanr::ckanr_setup(\"https://open.canada.ca/data\")\nsearch_results = ckanr::package_search(q = \"Pacific salmon\")\nsearch_results # Note that UUID also shows up here after the &lt;CKAN Package&gt; text\n\n# You  can also search specifically for spatial data (e.g., shapefiles, geodatabases, etc.) by specifying the fq argument\nsearch_results = ckanr::package_search(\n  q = \"Pacific salmon\",\n  fq = 'res_format:(SHP OR GDB OR GeoJSON OR KML OR CSV)' # CSVs sometimes contain spatial data, sometimes not\n)",

    "text": "Sir Isaac Newton said, “If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.” As scientists, we aim to share our findings with colleagues who may use the information to continue to make progress on important questions. Making your data more transparent and reproducible not only contributes to a more useful body of work but provides “shoulders” for those who come after you (other colleagues, students, and collaborators). It’s also handy for improving your own workflow. Your personal peace of mind is another added bonus to front loading the work of organizing and describing your dataset.\nYou might be wondering what are we referring to when we talk about “Open Science”. A more open approach to research means making results accessible for the benefits of both scientists and broader society (UNESCO 2023). The Open Science movement aims to increase transparency and the speed of knowledge transfer. Barriers to Open Science include things like: paywalled journals, favouring knowledge produced by high-income countries, hidden or unknown source code or workflow, and supporting data that is unavailable or unusable. In this article, we’ll tackle the last barrier and talk about practical ways to make your data more Open.",

Adapted from Wickham (2014).\nFor an excellent introduction to Tidy Data, check out Hadley Wickham’s 2014 paper in the Journal of Statistical Software (Wickham 2014). The tidy approach to data dictates that when organizing data, every observation should be represented by a row and every variable a column. This is a great approach for standardization and machine readability.",

    "text": "2. Redundancy in data is OK sometimes!\nThroughout our scientific careers, we’re often told to be concise and simplify so this advice may surprise you. Strategic redundancy in data allows you to make linkages between different pieces of information. It also saves space. One way to invoke the hidden power of redundancy is using metadata and data dictionaries to link important context to your primary dataset. For example, this table contains two types of observations: song information and Billboard rankings with one entry (i.e., row) each week the song remains on the Billboard Hot 100. Look what happens when we split the information into two tables: one with the song titles, artists’ names and run times; and the other with details on their Billboard rankings. This:\n\nAvoids confusion at scale – note how there are two types of temporal data in the first table. One could conflate time and date.\nSaves space. Say there were 100 songs with an average of 7 entries each. Rather than a table with 700 entries and 7 variables (4900 pieces of data), you now have 2 tables (containing 4500 data points total). This difference in memory usage scales with the size of your dataset.\n\n Table 1. Too much information at different scales crammed into a single table. Table adapted from Wickham (2014).\n Table 2: Example of using redundancy by splitting tables in two. Note how one song (left) has multiple Billboard rankings (right). Tables adapted from Wickham (2014).",

    "section": "3. Keep raw data raw",
    "text": "3. Keep raw data raw\nSeparating your raw data from analyses is essential for reproducibility. After all, how can we reproduce an analysis if we have no access to the original dataset? In repositories, create a folder named RAW. Place unmanipulated data here. Do not open these files except to add or remove raw data. You may consider setting them to “read-only” when viewing in Excel. Keep all analyses in your scripts and outside of Excel, which will read the data and create outputs from it. Use a descriptive file name for any outputs generated from raw data and place them in a separate folder.\nEmbracing Open Science practices doesn’t have to be overwhelming. By adopting tidy data formats, allowing for strategic redundancy, and keeping raw data untouched, you can contribute to a more transparent and collaborative scientific community and set yourself up for smoother workflows and more reproducible research. These small, intentional steps can have a big impact, helping others build on your work and accelerating the pace of discovery.",
