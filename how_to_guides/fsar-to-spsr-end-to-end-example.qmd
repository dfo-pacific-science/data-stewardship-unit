This example shows one practical path from a local FSAR dataset to an SPSR upload-ready package.

## Scenario

You have a CU-level escapement time series and supporting metadata for an FSAR update.

Goal: produce a validated package and submit through SPSR wizard.

## Step 1 — Start with source data and assumptions

Record:

- source dataset file(s)
- temporal scope
- CU/SMU scope
- key transformations already applied
- known caveats

## Step 2 — Map fields to canonical terms

Use [GC DFO Salmon Ontology documentation](../reference_info/ontology/formal-documentation.qmd) to map core columns to canonical IRIs.

Create a simple mapping table:

```csv
source_column,standard_label,standard_term_iri
CU_code,Conservation Unit,https://w3id.org/gcdfo/salmon#ConservationUnit
BY,Brood Year,https://w3id.org/gcdfo/salmon#BroodYear
Esc,Escapement,https://w3id.org/gcdfo/salmon#Escapement
```

## Step 3 — Build minimal salmon data package metadata

Create:

- `dataset.csv`
- `tables.csv`
- `column_dictionary.csv`
- `codes.csv` (if categorical values are present)

Reference: [Salmon data package specification](../reference_info/data_standards/salmon-data-exchange-package.qmd)

## Step 4 — Validate before upload

Run local checks (structure + semantics) and fix issues before submission.

## Step 5 — Prepare SPSR upload files

Confirm that your upload file(s):

- use the expected column naming/profile for your intake mode
- include required metadata context
- preserve traceability to source values

SPSR resources:

- docs: <https://spsr.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/documentation/>
- wizard: <https://spsr.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/wizard/1/>
- templates: <https://spsr.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/download_sdp_templates>

## Step 6 — Submit and iterate

1. Upload through wizard.
2. Review validation output.
3. Correct and resubmit as needed.
4. Record accepted version and intake date.

## Deliverables checklist

- [ ] mapped field table with canonical IRIs
- [ ] complete minimal salmon data package metadata files
- [ ] validated upload file(s)
- [ ] SPSR submission completed
- [ ] version/provenance notes archived
