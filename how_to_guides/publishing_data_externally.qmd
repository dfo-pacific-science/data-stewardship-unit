# üìò Reference Guide: Use of External Platforms for Data, Code, and Metadata

This guide is intended for scientists and technical staff in the **DFO Pacific Region Science Branch**. It outlines what is **allowed, restricted, or prohibited** when using **external platforms** (e.g., GitHub, Zenodo, Google Drive) to manage and share **DFO Science data, code, and metadata**, including during **Fishery Science Advisory Report (FSAR)** workflows.

## üîñ 1-Page Summary Table

| **Platform** | **Unclassified Data** | **Protected A** | **Protected B** | **Notes** |
|--------------|------------------------|------------------|------------------|----------|
| **GitHub (public repo)** | ‚úÖ Allowed (after internal release approval) | ‚ùå Prohibited | ‚ùå Prohibited | Only for non-sensitive code/data. Wait until FSAR is approved. |
| **GitHub (private repo)** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Internal collaboration only (before approval) | ‚ö†Ô∏è Discouraged | ‚ùå Prohibited | Use only for prep; not for Protected data. |
| **GitHub Codespaces** | ‚úÖ for unclassified code only | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | Don't use for Protected data or model outputs. |
| **GitHub Copilot** | ‚úÖ if code is non-sensitive | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | Never input Protected code/data. |
| **Google Drive / Sheets** | ‚ö†Ô∏è for internal drafts only | ‚ùå unless encrypted and approved | ‚ùå | Avoid as final storage. Not GC-authorized. |
| **Zenodo / Figshare / Dryad** | ‚úÖ after FSAR approval | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | Good for open datasets with DOIs. Must be approved first. |
| **GC Data Portal (Open.Canada.ca)** | ‚úÖ Required for final release | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | Official platform for open datasets. Requires release review. |
| **GCcollab / GCshare / SharePoint** | ‚úÖ Internal sharing | ‚úÖ With care | ‚ö†Ô∏è Rare; PB sharing requires approval | Use for internal collaboration or controlled external access. |

## üîê Data Classification Quick Reference

- **Unclassified (Public)**: No expected harm from disclosure. Includes open data, public metadata, and code that contains no sensitive logic or credentials.
  - _Examples_: Published R packages, fish counts aggregated by region and year, habitat model source code without raw data.
- **Protected A**: Could cause low-level injury if disclosed (e.g., minor confidentiality breach, operational disruption).
  - _Examples_: Unpublished but non-sensitive biological metrics tied to location or project; fishing effort by vessel class if potentially re-identifiable; unreviewed site-specific model outputs.
- **Protected B**: Could cause serious injury if disclosed (e.g., violation of legal obligations, significant economic harm).
  - _Examples_: Commercial catch by vessel or license number; spatially explicit stock assessment results; sensitive species occurrences; data provided under confidentiality agreements.

> üîó Refer to the [Policy on Government Security](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32611) for classification definitions and examples.  
> üîé Unsure if data is protected? Consult your divisional data contact or ATIP office.

## üß≠ Platform-by-Platform Guidance

### ‚úÖ GitHub (Public and Private)
- **Recommended for**: Open-source code, metadata schemas, documentation, workflows.
- **Allowed**: Unclassified data/code only. Must be released after internal approval.
- **Private repos**: Use for drafting and collaboration before public release. Do not use for long-term data storage.
- **FSAR Rule**: No public posting of data/code before FSAR is formally approved.

> üîó [TBS Directive on Open Government, Section 6.1](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=28108#cha6) ‚Äì Open information by default, subject to security/privacy.
> üîó [DFO Science Data Policy](https://waves-vagues.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/Library/40890794.pdf) ‚Äì Section 4.3: open access subject to classification review.

---

### üö´ GitHub Codespaces / Copilot
- **Codespaces**: Cloud-hosted dev environments. Not GC-approved for sensitive data. Fine for non-sensitive code.
- **Copilot**: Do not enter Protected data/code. Avoid unless using for generic logic.

> üîó [TBS Guide on Generative AI](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/digital-government-innovations/responsible-use-ai.html) ‚Äì Do not input sensitive information into third-party tools.

---

### üü° Google Drive / Sheets
- **Only use internally**, for early collaboration.
- **Never store Protected B data**.
- **Not an approved final repository**.

> üîó [TBS Policy on Service and Digital, Section 4.4.3.14](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=32603#cha4) ‚Äì Sensitive data must reside on GC-managed infrastructure in Canada.

---

### ‚úÖ Zenodo, Dryad, Figshare
- Use **after FSAR or publication approval**.
- Good for creating DOIs and enabling citation.
- Data must be fully unclassified and reviewed.

> üîó [Directive on Open Government, Section 6.2](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=28108#cha6) ‚Äì Public dissemination encouraged post-approval.

---

### ‚úÖ GC Open Data Portal
- **Official repository** for open DFO datasets.
- Requires metadata, data steward approval, and Open Government Licence.

> üîó [Open Government Licence](https://open.canada.ca/en/open-government-licence-canada)  
> üîó [Open Data Portal Submission Guide](https://open.canada.ca/en/submit-data)

## üßæ Internal DFO Requirements

### üì§ Even unclassified data must go through internal release process
- Managed by DFO Science Branch (via Data Stewards and Divisional Leads)
- Required steps:
  - Classification check (Unclassified vs. Protected)
  - Metadata form completion
  - Assignment of Data Steward / Contact
  - Quality and sensitivity review
- Applies to all formats (e.g., CSV, netCDF, RDS)

> üîó [DFO Science Data Policy, Section 3.4](https://waves-vagues.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/Library/40890794.pdf#page=7) ‚Äì All data must be reviewed before release, regardless of classification.

### ‚è≥ When to Release?
- **For FSAR-related data**: Only after advice is finalized and report is approved.
- **For code/metadata tools**: May be shared publicly once confirmed to contain no sensitive content.

> üîó [CSAS Procedural Manual](https://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/csas-sccs/process-processus/procedure-eng.html) ‚Äì Supporting material must not be released until advice is finalized.

## ‚ùìFAQ

### Can I work on FSAR code in GitHub before it's approved?
> ‚úÖ Yes, in a **private repo**. But do not share the repo publicly or link it in other outputs until the FSAR is finalized.

### Can I publish a dataset to Zenodo that underpins a FSAR?
> ‚ö†Ô∏è Only after the FSAR is **approved and cited**. Otherwise, it risks pre-empting the advice.

### What if my data are aggregated and not obviously sensitive?
> üîé If the data were derived from Protected B sources, they may **still be classified**. Check with your Data Steward.

### Can I share FSAR data with external partners before the FSAR is done?
> ‚ö†Ô∏è Only with explicit permission. Consider using SharePoint or GCcollab with restricted access. Not GitHub.

### Are there any GC tools for sharing Protected B data with partners?
> ‚úÖ Yes, but these must be vetted by IT or Shared Services. Ask your program‚Äôs IM/IT contact.
